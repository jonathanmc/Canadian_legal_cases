    International Inc. (“Drake”), an employment placement agency, appeals the
    award of damages made against it to Leather Treaty, a manufacturer of leather
    bracelets, in the amount of $130,975.90.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drake
    placed Simpson, an administrative assistant whose tasks were to include bookkeeping,
    in the employ of the respondent, Leather Treaty, without checking her references.
    Simpson worked as a trusted employee for Leather Treaty for over two years.
    After she resigned, Leather Treaty discovered that Simpson had been defrauding
    it. Leather Treaty went to the police, who laid fraud charges against Simpson.
    In January 2001, Simpson was convicted.  Leather Treaty also sued Simpson
    and her husband for fraud and obtained a civil judgment against them in February
    2001.  Simpson was found liable for $261,951.81 and her husband was found
    liable for one half of that amount. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    obtaining judgment against Simpson and her husband, Leather Treaty sued Drake.  The
    basis of the law suit, which alleged both breach of contract and tort, was
    that Drake failed to conduct reference checks on Simpson and did not check
    her background. Over Drake’s objections, the trial judge held that the judgment
    against Simpson and her husband did not bar Leather Treaty from seeking damages
    for the same loss from Drake because the causes of action were different.
    Drake was not being sued for fraud but for different torts, negligent misrepresentation
    contained in its fee schedule about the calibre of its service, negligence
    in failing to conduct reference checks, and for breach of contract. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the trial judge found Drake liable for Leather Treaty’s loss, he held that
    Leather Treaty contributed to its own losses in that its failure to supervise
    Simpson facilitated the fraud.  The trial judge reduced the damages by 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
    While contributory negligence does not ordinarily reduce damages for breach
    of contract, the trial judge was of the opinion that the result should be
    the same whether Leather Treaty recovered in contract or tort. Consequently,
    he also apportioned the damages for breach of contract. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the quantum of damages, the trial judge held that Drake was not
    liable for costs, such as the hiring of a forensic accountant, or for lost
    profits due to the time required to pursue civil remedies against Simpson.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the trial judge awarded Leather Treaty damages of $131,662 or
    one half of the amount of which it was defrauded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    the release of the trial judge’s judgment, counsel had a disagreement over
    its meaning and effect.   Drake raised the issue of double recovery by Leather
    Treaty and sought clarification of the judgment from the trial judge. The
    positions of the parties are set out below:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>a)         Leather Treaty’s position was that double recovery could be avoided
    by an undertaking by Leather Treaty not to enforce the portion of the judgment
    collected from Drake as against the Simpsons.  This could be done by advising
    the Sheriff of satisfaction of that amount from other sources and directing
    the Sheriff not to enforce to that extent.  This would enable Leather Treaty
    to continue to enforce the remainder of its principal and significant amounts
    of post-judgment interest as entitled under the Simpson judgment.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>b)         Drake’s position was that the amounts already recovered by Leather
    Treaty ought to be subtracted from the judgment as against Drake.  Its counsel
    wrote as follows: “The loss suffered by Leather Treaty was $261,951.81.  Your
    Honour’s finding was that Leather Treaty was 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent responsible
    for this loss –
    $130,975.90.  Permitting Leather Treaty to deduct the amount of the judgment
    awarded against Drake from the sums due and owing in the Simpson judgment
    would result in double recovery given the finding of contributory fault.  Drake
    further submits that the sums collected to date by Leather Treaty from the
    Simpsons must first be applied to the damages portion of that judgment and
    not on account of aggravated damages or prejudgment interest.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge responded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Leather Treaty’s position with respect to the undertaking
    is the correct one. The monies collected from the Simpsons are not to be
    deducted from the amount owed by Drake – this does not result in double recovery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    judgment incorporates the undertaking given as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THIS
    COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES THAT in accordance with Leather Treaty’s undertaking,
    the monies already collected and to be collected by Leather Treaty from Beverly
    and Robert Simpson in connection with court proceedings in Court File Number
    98-CV-15760CM, are not to be deducted from the amount set out in paragraph
    1 above. </p>

    appeals and raises 3 issues: </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;

    Treaty cross-appeals the trial judge’s finding that it was responsible for
    50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of its damages and submits that its contributory negligence
    should be capped at 25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>DECISION </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave very comprehensive reasons which are reported at (2005),
    36 C.C.L.T. (3d) 265, 15 B.L.R. (4th) 83.  He dealt with all of the issues
    raised on this appeal and the related jurisprudence in a very thorough manner.  Inasmuch
    as I agree with his decision and the reasons he gave, I propose to deal with
    the issues raised on this appeal in a summary fashion.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>1. Whether Leather
      Treaty was entitled to sue Drake notwithstanding its judgment against Simpson</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found Drake and Simpson severally rather than jointly liable
    on the basis that Drake and the Simpsons were not acting in concert or in
    furtherance of a common purpose.  In concluding that, subject to the rule
    barring double recovery, where a plaintiff elects to pursue a claim against
    one of severally liable defendants, there is no legal principle that holds
    that a plaintiff is precluded from pursuing a second action, the trial judge
    correctly relied on <i>Olsen v. Poirier et al.</i> (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 642
    at 650 (H.C.), aff’d (1980) 28 O.R. (2d) 744 (C.A.) and distinguished <i>Cuttell
    v. Bentz</i> (1985), 65 B.C.L.R. 273 (C.A.). It is not the <i>damage</i> <i>award</i> that
    amounts to satisfaction and bars a second action but the <i>recovery</i> by
    the plaintiff in the first action. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
    jurisprudence relied on by Drake, such as <i>Westar Aluminum &amp; Glass
    Ltd. v. Brenner </i>(1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 228 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.), relates
    only to the issue of suing alternatively liable parties on one contract or
    cause of action.   Here, there were separate contracts between Leather Treaty
    and Drake and between Leather Treaty and the Simpsons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge correctly held that on the facts of this case there was no bar
    to Leather Treaty commencing an action, unless it had actually received the
    full amount of the loss, which it had not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also note that Drake suffered no prejudice by virtue of the fact that
    separate proceedings were taken.  Drake is still entitled to claim over against
    the Simpsons for any amounts that it pays.  The trial judge dealt with the
    duplication of court time and effort that resulted<b> </b>from Leather Treaty’s
    decision not to sue all the parties at the same time by declining to award
    costs to Leather Treaty in separate reasons reported at (2006), 268 D.L.R.
    (4th) 756. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    oral argument before us, Drake also sought to rely on a decision involving
    cause of action estoppel.  However, cause of action estoppel was not pleaded,
    nor does the appellant meet the requirements for cause of action estoppel.
    The same causes of action are not raised, nor is there privity between the
    parties.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drake
    submits that because the result of the two actions is to give judgments to
    Leather Treaty for a total amount that is greater than 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
    of the damages, and this could not have happened had there been one action,
    Drake should not bear any liability or there will be the prospect of double
    recovery. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>An analogous argument was made in <i>Tucker
      (Guardian ad Litem of) v. Asleson </i>(1993), 102 D.L.R. (4th) 518 (B.C.C.A.),
      in which the plaintiff sued the tortfeasor and the Crown, who were described
      as several concurrent tortfeasors.  The Plaintiff then settled with the
      tortfeasor for one-third of the damages.  The Crown took the position that
      by its settlement the plaintiff could only claim two-thirds of the damages
      against the Crown because the plaintiff had been paid in full for one-third
      of the loss.  Southin J.A. rejected this argument.  At p. 576 she held
      that each of several concurrent tortfeasors was liable for the whole of
      the loss, and that that right was independent of whether the injured person
      sued both tortfeasors in one action or a separate action. The tortfeasor
      who had settled was entitled to maintain an action for contribution from
      the other tortfeasor.  Liability had not been apportioned in the first
      action because it was not necessary.  In the action as between tortfeasors
      apportionment was necessary if the tortfeasor who had settled was to recover
      for amounts paid in excess of its liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    conclusion in this regard is also consistent with the Ontario Law Reform
    Commission’s conclusion in its <i>Report on Contribution Among Wrongdoers
    and Contributory Negligence</i> (Toronto: Ontario Ministry of the Attorney
    General, 1988) at  137-138: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>P’s right to recover in full from D1 should never
    be prejudiced by the fact that there is another wrongdoer (D2) liable to
    P, even if P’s contributory negligence vis-a-vis that person has reduced
    the amount that P can claim from D2.  Nor should D2 be required to contribute
    a greater amount than that for which she was liable to P: any payments made
    by D1 to P that exceed this sum confer no benefit upon D2. Subject to this
    limitation, it is recommended that P’s loss should be distributed between
    D1 and D2 without regard to the fact that D2 is liable to P for a lesser
    sum than D1.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drake
    submits that this second action is an abuse of process and that it is unfair
    for it to now be subject to paying the entire 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
    judgment for which it was found liable because Simpson is insolvent.  The
    short answer to this submission is that insolvency is not relevant to the
    allocation of fault. See <i>Renaissance Leisure Group Inc., c.o.b.

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    it cites no authority in support of its submission, Drake claims that it
    is “unfair” for it to have to pay the full 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the damages
    for which it was found liable. It submits that the amounts that Simpson has
    paid should be deducted from the total amount of damages awarded and that
    it should then have to pay 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the remaining amount.  This
    argument again confuses liability with recovery and I would not give effect
    to it. Drake is liable to Leather Treaty for the full 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
    of the damages and can claim over against Simpson for contribution and indemnity. </p>

    general rule respecting the date for the assessment of damages is also contrary
    to Drake’s position. Almost invariably, the plaintiff is entitled to have
    his or her damages assessed at the date of the breach, not the date that
    judgment is obtained. A common example occurs where the value of the property
    of which the plaintiff has been deprived declines in value between the date
    of the wrong and the date of judgment.  In this circumstance, the plaintiff
    is nevertheless entitled to damages at the date of the defendant’s wrong.  The
    same is generally true when the value of the property increases between the
    date of the wrong and the date of judgment.   See S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law
    of Damages</i>, looseleaf (Aurora:
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    Canada Law Book, 1991) at 1-28 – 1-30.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the case of breach of contract, the theory is that damages “crystallize” at
    the date of the breach. Waddams discusses two policy reasons for this approach.
    The first is that if the damage assessment is postponed to the date of judgment,
    one party will then have an incentive to delay the conduct of the action.
    The second is that the party committing the wrong should not, as a general
    rule, obtain the benefit of changes in value.  This policy choice recognizes
    that in some cases the plaintiff may be overcompensated in the sense that
    the plaintiff may be made more than whole for the loss. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the trial judge avoided the unfairness of overcompensation by
    making the order that he did.  The trial judge correctly addressed the issue
    of double recovery by way of the undertaking that was given. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>2. Did the trial

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drake
    submits that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error when he
    found that Leather Treaty would not have hired Simpson if it had received
    the background information about her. Drake’s position is that there was
    no evidence on this point before the trial judge and the evidence was that “fit” was
    the most important hiring criterion. Drake argues that Leather Treaty would
    have hired Simpson regardless of the information Drake provided and, as a
    result, there is no causal connection between the loss and Drake’s failure
    to perform reference checks. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leather
    Treaty did not only care about
    “fit”.  The evidence clearly indicates it wanted a competent employee. The
    reference in question that was not provided was extremely negative. The trial
    judge’s inference that Leather Treaty would not have hired Simpson if it
    had been given this reference was a proper one. The trial judge committed
    no palpable and overriding error in finding that Drake’s failure to check
    references before placing Simpson in Leather Treaty’s employ caused or contributed
    to Leather Treaty’s loss.   </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>3. Did the trial
      judge err in his apportionment of Damages to Drake?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s actual apportionment erred in attributing
    50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent responsibility to Drake because 85&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
    ($225,109.02) of the loss could have been prevented if appropriate controls
    were in place.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s argument is tantamount to the
    “last clear chance doctrine”, where liability is apportioned to a much greater
    degree to the party who had the last opportunity to avoid the loss.  This
    was rejected on two bases in <i>Snushall v. Fulsang</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d)
    142 at para. 30 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 519. The first
    was that this approach looks only to the consequences of the plaintiff’s
    conduct rather than the entirety of both parties’ tortious acts. The second
    is that it fails to address tort law’s primary objective of restoring the
    plaintiff to the position it would have enjoyed but for the negligence of
    the defendant.  While the decision in <i>Snushall</i>, <i>supra</i>, relates
    to a motor vehicle accident in which the passenger failed to wear a seatbelt,
    the principles on which it is based are of general applicability. The more
    weight that is attached to Leather Treaty’s contributory negligence, the
    more the assessment of Drake’s negligence, which includes its moral and legal
    blameworthiness, is reduced. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    Drake’s submission overlooks the very high standard of deference that is
    owed to a trial judge’s apportionment of liability.  A jury award assessing
    the degree of contributory negligence is to be approached in the same way
    as a jury verdict respecting damages generally. See <i>Snushall v. Fulsang</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 19-22 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A<b>.</b></st1:country-region>
    <b>). </b>The same level of deference is accorded when these determinations
    are made by a trial judge. </p>

    courts will not interfere unless the verdict is so plainly unreasonable and
    unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole
    and acting judicially could have arrived at that conclusion: <i>McCannell
    v. McLean</i>, [1937] S.C.R. 341; <i>Olmstead v. Vancouver-Fraser Park District</i>,

    Treaty submits that the trial judge’s findings do not take into account the
    very different character of Drake’s fault as compared to Leather Treaty’s.
    Drake knew that it was sending Simpson into a start-up company that did not
    appear to be properly organized. These facts suggest that Drake’s breach
    was the more serious of the two. Contributory negligence should be capped
    at 25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent because this case is analogous to <i>Snushall</i> in
    that the negligence of Leather Treaty has absolutely no connection to the
    fact of Drake’s negligence. </p>

    I would hold that the high standard for revision of the trial judge’s finding
    and apportionment has not been met. <i>Snushall</i> was a seatbelt defence
    case, which is a specialized area of law in which the range set for contributory
    negligence is now well-established. That is not the situation here. The trial
    judge here considered a number of decisions that determined contributory
    fault for negligent financial oversight, with a range of apportionment from
    15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent to 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. I see no basis on which to
    interfere with his apportionment.  </p>
