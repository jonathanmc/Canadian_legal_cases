    partners in a partnership that provided management services to the two respondent
    corporations were employees of those corporations for purposes of the <i>Employer Health Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    E.11 (the “<i>EHTA</i>”).</p>
  <h4>Facts</h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents, Service Mold Inc. (“Service
    Mold”) and SMI Sales Inc. (“SMI Sales”), carry on business in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Windsor,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Service Mold manufactures molds for the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents entered into management
    agreements with Service Mold Associates (S.M.A.), a partnership, pursuant to
    which S.M.A. agreed to provide executive, managerial and consultant services.  The payments to S.M.A. for these services
    were calculated as a percentage of the respondents’ profits. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only two partners of S.M.A. were Mike Munger
    and Martin Schuurman (together “the partners”). The partners were also the only
    officers and directors of both respondents during the relevant period.  They also held shares in SMI Sales both
    personally, and indirectly through corporations they owned with members of
    their families.  The shares of Service
    Mold were held in equal shares by the partners’ spouses.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal concerns the amount of employer
    health tax owed by the respondents for the tax years from 1995 to 1998.  Section 2(2) of the <i>EHTA</i> requires employers to remit employer health tax in respect of
    the total
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    remuneration they pay in a tax year. “Total
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario remuneration” is defined
    in s. 1(1) of the <i>EHTA</i> as the total
    remuneration paid by an employer to employees working at or paid through a
    permanent establishment of the employer located in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the tax years in question, the respondents
    did not include payments they made to S.M.A. in their total
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario remuneration, taking the position
    that no tax was owed on these payments as they were not paid to an employee.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead, the partners paid employer health tax
    on the payments they received from S.M.A. as self-employment income.  Doing so attracted a lower rate of tax than
    that which would have applied if the respondents had included the payments to S.M.A.
    as part of their total
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    remuneration.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1999, the Minister issued notices of
    assessment to the respondents requiring that they include their payments to S.M.A.
    in their total
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    remuneration.  The respondents filed
    notices of objection to the Minister’s assessments and the Minister confirmed
    the assessments.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents filed notices of appeal which
    led to the hearing and judgment that give rise to this appeal.  The respondents paid the tax as assessed on a
    without prejudice basis pending the outcome of their appeals. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that the payments made by
    the respondents to S.M.A. were not payments made to an employee and as such,
    the respondents were not required to include these payments within their total
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    remuneration.  He ordered the Minister to
    reimburse the respondents the tax they had paid on a without prejudice basis.  The trial judge further awarded costs to the
    respondents on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>
  <h4>The Issues</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge framed the issue before him as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The narrow issue to
    be resolved in this matter is whether [S.M.A.], the partnership in question is
    to be considered as an individual employee under the [<i>EHTA</i>], whose receipt of payments from the two corporations, SMI and
    Service Mold, would trigger the imposition of employer health tax.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded that S.M.A. was not an
    employee because the <i>EHTA</i> requires
    that an employee be an individual and a partnership is not an individual.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this appeal, the Minister agrees with the
    trial judge’s conclusion that the partnership, S.M.A. was not an employee of
    the respondents.  However, the Minister
    argues that the trial judge framed the issue incorrectly.  The question is not whether the partnership was
    an employee of the respondents, but rather whether the two partners were employees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To be fair to the trial judge, it is not
    entirely clear how the issues were framed before him.  Whatever the case, the Minister now bases his
    submissions solely on the argument that the two corporations were liable to pay
    tax because the partners, not the partnership, were employees of the two
    corporations within the meaning of the <i>EHTA</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister also appeals the trial judge’s
    award of costs in favour of the respondents on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relevant provisions in the <i>EHTA</i> are as follows:</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister argues that the partners were
    employees under both paras. (a) and (b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to para. (a), the Minister relies upon the
    common law in arguing that the partners were employees of the respondents.  In particular, the Minister argues that the
    four <i>indicia</i> of an employment relationship
    set out in <i>Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. M.N.R.</i> (1986), 87 D.T.C. 5025 (F.C.A.) lead to the conclusion that a common law
    employment relationship existed in this case.  The four factors that must be examined under <i>Wiebe Door</i> are control, ownership of tools, chances of profit/risk of
    loss and integration.  No single factor
    governs.  The test requires a court to
    look at the total relationship in light of the four factors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not apply the <i>Wiebe Door</i> analysis and thus he did not
    decide some of the relevant questions.  That said, I am satisfied that there is a sufficient factual record
    before this court to address the Minister’s submission.  I have concluded that the partners were not
    employees of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To start, unlike the situation in <i>Wiebe Door</i>, there were no direct agreements
    between the partners and respondents.  The respondents made payments to S.M.A. and S.M.A.’s profits were
    distributed to the partners according to the terms of the partnership, rather
    than according to agreements between the respondents and S.M.A.  Neither of the partners received direct or
    individualized compensation from the respondents for the work he
    performed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first factor in <i>Wiebe Door</i> is control.  Typically, an employer exercises control over an employee’s activities.  The Minister argues that the element of
    control was present in this case because the agreement specified that S.M.A.
    would not provide services to the respondents’ competitors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While this is true, I hardly think it
    constitutes the type of control that lies at the heart of an employment
    relationship.  The more important
    consideration is how much control the respondents exercised over the partners
    themselves in performing the work under the contract (see <i>Wiebe Door</i> at 5027).  The
    answer is virtually none.  The management
    agreements require only that S.M.A. provide services.  They did not impose obligations on either of
    the partners to perform any particular duties, or any duties at all, nor do
    they specify how either partner is to be compensated.  Indeed, under the terms of the management
    agreements, it is open to S.M.A. to have persons other than the partners
    perform some or all of the work for the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even if the respondents directed S.M.A. how the
    work was to be performed, they did not dictate who was to perform it or what
    remuneration those who did the work would receive.  In my view, the factor of control in these
    circumstances weighs very strongly against the existence of an employment
    relationship between the respondents and the partners.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second factor is the ownership of
    tools.  In an employment relationship,
    the employer generally supplies the equipment and tools required by the
    employee.  In this case, the record is
    sparse as to this element of the relationship.  Apparently, the respondents and S.M.A. operated out of the same
    facilities and shared equipment and supplies.  In addition, the management agreements provided that the respondents
    would reimburse S.M.A. for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  Despite the lack of detailed evidence, this
    factor seems consistent with an employment relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The next factor relates to the chances of
    profit/risks of loss.  While one cannot
    be categorical, it is a feature of most employment relationships that employees
    are paid regardless of profitability.  In
    this case, the compensation paid to S.M.A. depended entirely on the
    profitability of the respondents.  If
    there were no profits, there would be no payment to the partnership.  The partnership and the partners, to the
    extent they performed work, would have performed services for no compensation
    whatsoever.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it is true that the respondents agreed to
    pay S.M.A.’s out-of-pocket expenses, I am of the view that the overall payment
    structure in the management agreements point away from an employer/employee
    relationship.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The final <i>Wiebe
    Door</i> factor is integration.  The
    Minister argues that there was considerable integration between the respondents’
    businesses and the partners’ activities and that the services performed by the
    partners were essential to the respondents’ businesses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not consider whether the partners
    were integrated into the respondents’ businesses.  Clearly, S.M.A. provided important services
    to the respondents’ businesses.  However,
    viewed from S.M.A.’s perspective, there is nothing in the management agreements
    that required it or the partners to devote all or even a specific portion of
    their time to the respondents’ businesses. The management agreements, which
    created the relationship relied upon by the Minister did not require
    integration.  Those agreements permitted
    S.M.A. and the partners to provide services to anyone who did not compete with
    the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Looking at the total relationship between the
    partners and the respondents in light of the four <i>Wiebe Door</i> factors, I conclude that the partners were not employees
    of the respondents pursuant to the common law test or within the meaning of
    para. (a) of the definition of an employee in the <i>EHTA.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister also argues that the partners were employees
    by virtue of the definition of employee in para. (b) which defines an employee
    as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>an individual who
    holds office from an employer and receives remuneration in respect of the
    performance of the duties of the office.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The partners were officers and directors of the
    respondents and thus held office from the respondents within the meaning of the
    paragraph.  The question then becomes
    whether the payments they received from S.M.A. constituted “remuneration in
    respect of the performance of the duties” of being officers or directors of the
    respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected this argument.  He found that the partners “were not paid as
    officers or directors of the [respondents]”.  This finding was supported by the evidence.  The respondents paid S.M.A. pursuant to the
    management agreements.  Those agreements
    required S.M.A. to perform executive, managerial and consultant services.  The agreements contemplated S.M.A. being
    compensated for the provision of those services.  They made no reference to the partners
    providing services to the respondents as officers or directors.  Moreover, the amounts of any payments made to
    the partners for the work they performed through S.M.A. were determined
    pursuant to the partnership arrangement, not as a result of directions from the
    respondents to compensate the partners for duties performed as officers or
    directors.  I see no basis to interfere
    with the trial judge’s finding that the partners were not paid as officers or
    directors of the respondents.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, in my view, the Minister’s argument that
    the partners were employees pursuant to para. (b) of the definition of
    “employee” set out in the <i>EHTA</i> must
    fail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only other argument of the Minister that
    requires comment relates to the application of s. 2(3)(a) of the <i>EHTA</i>.  That section reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>(3)
    In determining the tax payable under this Act by any person, a payment made by
    the person, including a payment in kind, may be deemed by the Minister to be
    part of the total Ontario remuneration paid by the person where, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(a)    the
    payment is made to an employee of the person or to another person who at the
    time of the payment did not deal at arm’s length, within the meaning of section
    251 of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> [Canada],
    with an employee of the person; and …</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister argues that the partners directed
    and controlled the respondents and S.M.A. at all relevant times.  The parties, therefore, did not deal at arm’s
    length with S.M.A. and payments made to S.M.A. should be deemed to be part of
    the total
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    remuneration paid by the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This argument is based on a flawed reading of
    the section.  Section 2(3)(a) is a
    specific anti-avoidance provision.  It
    captures only payments made to an employee or to a person who did not deal at
    arm’s length with an employee.  Because neither
    the partners nor S.M.A. were employees of the respondents, s. 2(3)(a) does not
    capture the payments made to S.M.A.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, in my view, s. 2(3) does not help
    the Minister.  I note in passing that the <i>EHTA</i> does not have a general anti-avoidance
    provision similar to s. 245 of the <i>Income
    Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his judgment, the trial judge awarded

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, the respondents indicated that the

    interfere with the trial judge’s award of costs.</p>
