    acquaintance and friend of the appellant and her sons.  Mr. Patchett testified that at about 12:00
    noon on Sunday, June 13, 2004, he went to the appellant’s apartment in Sutton
    and shared some marijuana with the appellant and one of her sons.  Mr. Patchett testified that in the afternoon,
    he drove with the appellant and her younger son to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket where she delivered her younger son

    return from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Newmarket,
    the appellant purchased a 12-pack of beer.  The appellant and Mr. Patchett drank beer as they drove back to the
    apartment and Mr. Patchett threw the empties out of the window.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When they got back to the appellant’s apartment,
    Mr. Patchett, the appellant, Glen Murray and Trevor Wilson (another son of the
    appellant) decided to drive to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston.  This was about 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. on June 13,
    2004.  The appellant was the driver.  Glen Murray sat in the front passenger seat
    and Mr. Patchett and Trevor Wilson sat in the rear seat.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Patchett testified that the appellant
    purchased a 28-bottle case of beer.  All
    of the occupants of the car drank beer as they travelled in the car.  The appellant was speeding and weaving in and
    out of traffic as she drove the car eastbound on Highway 401.  As the car approached the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    the car and collided with a red Honda Accord.</p>

    to leave the scene because she had been drinking.  She followed the advice and together with her
    son, Trevor Wilson, headed down the highway embankment and across a field
    towards
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    said that he was hitchhiking to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston.  P.C. Brown also spoke to Mr. Murray who was
    not co-operative.  It was only several
    weeks later that Mr. Patchett gave a statement to the police in which he
    identified the appellant as the driver of the car.</p>

    eastbound on Highway 401 and saw the accident.  He observed the appellant’s car (a blue Neon) sliding at 90 degrees to
    the flow of traffic and strike a maroon Honda.  He also had observed the blue Neon weaving in and out of traffic before
    the collision.  He stopped his car after
    the collision and observed four people in the blue Neon.  A female was seated in the driver seat.  The three other passengers were males.  He saw the female and a young male walk away
    through a field towards

    eastbound on Highway 401 on June 13, 2004 and he observed through his rear view
    mirror a car “zipping in and out” of two left lanes.  He later observed the car bounce off a
    guardrail and collide with another car.  Mr. Langille stopped his car.  He
    went to a blue car and observed four people in it and smelled alcohol – three
    males and one female.  He saw the female
    and someone else run down the embankment towards

  <h2>(ii)      The Appellant’s Defence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant testified that ten or eleven
    friends gathered on June 13, 2004 in the parking lot in front of her apartment
    building and discussed what they were going to do that day.  They decided that they were going to go to
    the beach at De Lasalle Park about ten minutes away.  They left about 12:00 noon or 1:00 p.m.  Her car was parked in its usual parking spot
    in the parking lot, unlocked, with the car keys in the console.  She went to the park in the van of a friend.  Mr. Patchett was initially part of the group
    but he did not go to the beach.  He was
    not welcome because he was drunk and behaving badly, including urinating on one
    of the cars in the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The group stayed at the park until 6:00 or 7:00
    p.m.  Before the appellant left the park,
    she phoned her son,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tyler,
    and asked him to go to her car and see if her cell phone was in the car.  Her son looked out the window and told his
    mother that her car was not in the parking lot.  She thought her son was joking.  However, in the event that he was not joking, she told him to call the
    police and report the car as stolen which he did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence called Glen Murray as a
    witness.  Mr. Murray testified that at
    about 4:00 or 4:30 p.m., he was walking on a road out of Sutton.  Mr. Patchett came along in a car (Patchett was
    a passenger) and stopped and offered Mr. Murray a lift home.  A female, who was aged 19 or 20, was driving
    the car.  He got into the car and sat in
    the back seat behind the driver.  As they
    drove along they decided to go for a drive and “party”.  Mr. Patchett and Mr. Murray drank beer which
    Mr. Patchett had in the trunk of the car.  They headed south on Highway 404 and then east on Highway 401.  Mr. Patchett and the female driver of the car
    also smoked marijuana.  </p>

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Kennedy Road the car went out of
    control.  It collided with another car
    and ended up on a shoulder of the highway with the car facing the wrong way.  Mr. Patchett told the woman to leave the
    scene which she did.  The police arrived
    and eventually Mr. Murray made his way home by hitchhiking and taking a
    bus.  He said he got home at about 4:00
    or 5:00 a.m.  </p>

    with the appellant in the summer of 2005.  At the time of the trial in 2006, he had been living with the appellant
    for about a year.  At the time of the
    accident on June 14, 2004, he did not know the appellant although two of her
    sons had been working for him in the moving business.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Murray testified that the appellant was not the
    driver of the car.  He also testified
    that he sat behind the female driver of the car for about two to two and a half
    hours but was unable to give any kind of a description of her other than a
    vague description of the colour of her hair. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He was unaware that the appellant had been

  <h2>(iii)     The Video Statement of the
    Appellant and John David</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At about 12:45 a.m. on June 14, 2004, P.C.
    Brown, the investigating officer from the OPP, spoke to the appellant on the
    telephone and she told him that her car had been stolen.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That evening, she had also received a telephone
    call from Mr. Patchett who was at the hospital.  Patchett told her he had taken the car and would arrange to pay for the
    damage.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At about 2:20 a.m. on July 14, 2004, P.C. Brown
    attended at the appellant’s apartment.  The appellant was with John David who was a friend who lived in the
    apartment building.  P.C. Brown then
    placed the appellant and Mr. David in the back seat of his police cruiser and
    took a video statement from them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the taking of the video statement, the
    appellant did not tell P.C. Brown that she had received a call from Mr.
    Patchett in which he told her that he was taking responsibility for the damage
    to her car.  Mr. Patchett showed up at
    the appellant’s apartment after P.C. Brown left and apologized to the
    appellant.  He told her that he had been with
    two males and a female.  The next day,
    the appellant told Mr. Patchett that he better “own up” and he said he would
    take care of it.</p>
  <h2>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge reviewed the evidence of all of
    the witnesses.  In respect of Mr.
    Patchett, he observed that there was a genuine issue of his credibility.  He noted that he had been brought to court in
    custody following his arrest on a material witness warrant – having previously
    failed to respond to a subpoena on at least two occasions.  He also emphasized that Mr. Patchett had
    originally told P.C. Brown that he did not know the driver of the blue Neon
    car.  Nevertheless, he concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It was clear from Mr.
    Patchett’s evidence at trial that he is not a pillar of the community and that
    he will never win a “citizen of the year” prize.  However, Mr. Patchett gave completely honest
    and reliable testimony at this trial.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge found that Mr.
    Patchett was unshaken in cross-examination and that there were no
    inconsistencies that were of any probative significance in his evidence.  He was forthcoming and not evasive.  The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Very significantly, Mr.
    Patchett’s testimony was strongly corroborated by other evidence at trial.  Ms. McKerness’ videotaped statement to
    Officer Brown confirmed that she had gone to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket with her son that afternoon, as Mr.
    Patchett testified, and not to the beach, as Ms. McKerness testified.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    from the two independent witnesses, Glen Joseph and Dean Langille, which
    corroborated Mr. Patchett’s testimony.  The trial judge also referred to certain evidence of the independent
    witnesses that was inconsistent with the testimony of Mr. Patchett.  He found these inconsistencies to be
    relatively minor and not of significance.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his review of the appellant’s evidence, the
    trial judge concluded that there were major inconsistencies and contradictions
    in her testimony.  A number of the contra-dictions
    arose as a result of the difference between her evidence at trial and what she
    had said on the videotaped statement taken at 2:20 a.m. on June 14, 2004.  The trial judge made specific reference to
    many of these inconsistencies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded his review of the
    appellant’s evidence as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When Ms. McKerness
    testified on direct examination, she had obviously forgotten the details of the
    videotaped state-ment that she had given to Officer Brown in the early morning
    hours of June 14, 2004.  When the
    defendant was confronted with the glaring discrepancies, she was agitated and
    upset and had no plausible answers.  I
    conclude that the defendant’s testimony was fabricated and was not
    truthful.  I reject it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the evidence of Mr. Murray, the
    trial judge reviewed his testimony and concluded: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Glen Murray was not a
    truthful witness.  He testified that
    there were three persons in the blue Neon, whereas Mr. Patchett and Glen Joseph
    (one of the independent witnesses) said that there were four persons.  Mr. Murray testified that the female driver
    was alone when she fled the scene, which was contradicted by Mr. Patchett and
    both of the independent witnesses.  Mr.
    Murray’s inability to describe the female driver was not believable.  He was allegedly in the vehicle with her for
    two to two and a half hours.  It is
    interesting to note that Mr. Murray told Officer Brown (when the officer was
    investigating the accident on-scene) that he thought the name of the person who
    had been driving the blue Neon started with the letter “D”.  Mr. Murray changed his testimony to say that
    the driver had blonde hair.  Then he gave
    waffling explanations, such as “brunette, blonde, it’s basically the same”. …
    Mr. Murray’s testimony was evasive on some issues, such as the driver’s hair
    colour.  I considered Mr. Murray’s
    demeanour as well.  I reject his
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also rejected the evidence of
    the two other defence witnesses as the product of fabrication and collusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded his reasons for
    judgment as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have borne in mind
    that the onus does not shift to the defendant under any circumstances.  The defence submitted that I should accept
    Ms. McKerness’s testimony or, if I rejected it, that I should be left with a
    reasonable doubt, in accordance with the second branch of the ruling in <u>R.
    v. W.D.</u> [[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742].  I
    have considered Ms. McKerness’s testimony in the context of the evidence as a
    whole, and her testimony does not leave me with a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In all criminal
    prosecutions, the burden rests solely on the Crown to prove all elements of the
    offences beyond a reasonable doubt.  I
    have considered the totality of the evidence and the submissions of
    Counsel.  I am satisfied that the Crown
    has discharged the burden in this case.  There will be findings of guilty on all counts.</p>

    complaint appears to be that the trial judge preferred his evidence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The appellant is really asking us to

  <h2>(i)        Lack of sufficient opportunity
    to review the video statement</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The transcript at trial indicates that counsel
    for the Crown advised counsel for the appellant on May 5, 2006 of the
    availability of the video tape.  Apparently there was some misunderstanding or miscommunication on the part
    of defence counsel and he did not respond to the Crown’s offer to make the tape
    available.  Defence counsel made it clear
    that he attributed no fault to the Crown.  An opportunity was afforded to the appellant to review the video tape in
    the presence of her counsel before she was cross-examined on the understanding
    that she would not discuss the statement with her lawyer.  Defence counsel made no objection to this
    manner of proceeding and readily agreed to it.  In these circumstances, I see no reasonable basis for complaint.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Did the
    trial judge err in admitting the appellant’s video statement for the truth of
    its contents?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the outset, I should observe that the video
    statement was not admitted as part of the Crown’s case.  Also, no issue was taken as to its
    voluntariness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is apparent, at least in part, that the trial
    judge relied upon the appellant’s video taped statement for the truth of its
    contents. A clear example of this is the following excerpt from his reasons for
    judgment referred to above in para. 25:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Very significantly, Mr.
    Patchett’s testimony was strongly corroborated by other evidence at trial.  Ms. McKerness’ videotaped statement to
    Officer Brown confirmed that she had gone to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket with her son that afternoon, as Mr.
    Patchett testified, and not to the beach, as Ms. McKerness testified.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the trial judge was in
    error in relying upon the above part of the appellant’s statement for its
    truth.  A prior inconsistent statement,
    not adopted by the appellant, only serves to impeach her credibility: see J.
    Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (2<sup>nd</sup> ed, 1999) at 16.134.  Such
    a statement is not admissible for its truth.  The counsel for the Crown conceded that to the extent the trial judge
    relied upon the appellant’s videotaped statement for its truth, he erred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duty counsel also submits that the trial judge
    ought not to have used the video-taped statement to contradict one of the
    defence witnesses (Fabian Slatcher) as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Additionally, the
    videotaped statement Ms. McKerness gave to Officer Brown (respecting the
    visitation with her son Kyle and returning him to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket that afternoon), contradicted Mr.
    Slatcher’s version of events.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Again, the trial judge appears to
    have used the videotaped statement for the truth of its contents.  In so doing, he erred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duty counsel also complained that the trial
    judge used John David’s statement to contradict the appellant.  In this respect, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dave [John David], who
    had participated in the videotaped statement, told Officer Brown that they had
    walked to the beach, and it took more than 40 minutes, because they had the
    kids with them.  When questioned about
    that, the defendant answered, “I don’t know why he made that statement.  He might have said it because I said
    it.”  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the trial judge ought
    not to have relied on the videotaped statement of John David.  Mr. David was not a witness in the trial and
    was not available for cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The question for this court is whether the
    errors made by the trial judge in his use of the appellant’s videotaped
    statement are serious enough to require a new trial.  In my view, they are not.  There were very significant contradictions in
    the videotaped statement of the appellant which clearly reflected adversely on
    the credibility of her evidence at trial.  The trial judge quite properly took note of these contradictions in
    assessing her evidence.  In my view, the
    appellant’s credibility was clearly shaken and, absent the errors made, the
    result would still have been the same.  This was an extremely strong Crown case.</p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did the
    trial judge err in relying on innocuous differences between the appellant’s
    video statement close to the time of the events and her trial testimony?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  As indicated above, there were
    significant differences between her video statement and trial testimony which
    the trial judge was, in my view, fully justified in taking into account.  The fact that she did not tell Officer Brown
    during the video statement that she had received a telephone call from Mr.
    Patchett earlier that evening that he had taken her car, but she still persisted
    in alleging that the car had been stolen, represented a major blow to her
    credibility in itself.</p>
  <h2>(iv)      Did the
    trial judge err in not invoking the <i>Kienapple</i> principle in respect of
    staying either count three or count four in the information?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Count four in the information contains the
    charge of obstructing a police officer engaged in the execution of his
    duty.  Count six in the information
    contains the charge of public mischief.  The gravamen of the two offences was the appellant’s false report to the
    police.  Counsel for the Crown concedes
    that in accordance with the principle articulated in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 one of the two counts should
    have been stayed by the trial judge.</p>
  <h2>Disposition of the Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal
    in respect of count four and stay the conviction under that count in accordance
    with the <i>Kienapple</i> principle.  I would otherwise dismiss the appeal as to
    conviction.</p>
  <h2>Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The inmate’s notice of appeal does not contain
    any grounds of appeal in respect of sentence.  Having read the trial judge’s reasons, I can find no error in
    principle.  The sentence appears to be a
    fit sentence.  The offences for which the
    appellant was convicted are extremely serious.  She was speeding on
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    busiest highway and weaving in and out of traffic, having consumed a
    considerable amount of alcohol.  She was
    fortunate that the consequences of her actions did not result in far greater
    personal injuries or death.  She left the
    scene of the accident and falsely reported her vehicle as stolen.  Her conduct in this respect is also reprehensible.  I would therefore grant leave to appeal
    sentence but would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
