    appeal and cross-appeal arise out of an oppression and breach of trust action.
    The claims relate to three private corporations, Wonsch and Sons Ltd. (“WSL”),
    Wonsch Construction and Investments (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Essex) Ltd. (WCIEL) and Wonsch Construction Company Ltd (“the company”),
    with which WSL and WCIEL were amalgamated in 1987. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    company was founded by Edward Wonsch.  Upon his death in 1971, his wife,
    Agnes Wonsch, assumed control and upon her death in 1986, her shares were
    bequeathed to their six children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    of the children, the respondent Bryan Wonsch, suffers from a mental illness.
    Bryan Wonsch and Bryan Wonsch Trust (“BWT”) (the “minority shareholders”)
    are the plaintiffs in this litigation.  Agnes Wonsch created the BWT in 1980
    to look after the interests of Bryan and his children.  Bryan Wonsch was
    convicted of manslaughter in the death of his mother in 1986.  In an earlier
    proceeding, it was held that while Bryan Wonsch cannot benefit from his mother’s
    estate, the interests of his children as beneficiaries of the BWT are not
    affected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants Gordon, Charles and Kenneth Wonsch (“the majority shareholders”)
    ran the company following their mother’s death.  The majority shareholders
    purchased shares owned by their sisters in WSL in 1987 as part of an amalgamation
    plan designed to secure certain tax advantages for the amalgamating companies.  The
    trial judge found that there was a legitimate business reason for the amalgamation
    and that the plan resulted in a significant benefit for the minority shareholders.  Gordon
    and Charles Wonsch are the trustees of the estate of Agnes Wonsch and trustees
    of the BWT.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    company went through a difficult period from 1985 to 1994 when it was embroiled
    in litigation and unable to return a profit.  The majority shareholders guided
    the company through that period, assuming significant financial risks during
    the course of the litigation.  In 1987, during that financially difficult
    period, the majority shareholders purchased the shares in WSL to which their
    sisters were beneficially entitled.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    the period between 1997 and 2001, the company made significant profits and
    the majority shareholders paid themselves large salaries.<span class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'> </span></span>The
    minority shareholders challenged the salaries as oppressive conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the majority shareholders had paid themselves disguised
    dividends in the form of excessive management compensation, and had committed
    a breach of trust by purchasing the shares their sisters owned in 1987 in
    breach of their obligations as executors under their mother’s will and as
    trustees of BWT.  He also ordered them to pay BWT its share of the residue
    of the estate, the sum of $50,000.  However, in a subsequent judgment, he
    refused to award prejudgment interest and he ordered costs against the corporation
    rather than the majority shareholders.  The majority shareholders appeal
    the liability findings and the minority shareholders appeal the refusal of
    pre-judgment interest and the order that the costs be paid by the corporation.</p>
  <h4>Appeal</h4>
  <h2>1.         Payment of $50,000</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the majority shareholders that the trial judge made a palpable
    and overriding error in finding that the appellants had failed to pay the
    sum of $50,000 to BWT as its share of the residue in the mother’s estate.  The
    accounts of the estate were passed in 1996 and it is clear beyond any question
    from those accounts and the judgment approving the accounts that BWT received
    its share of the residue of the estate.  We see no merit in the submission
    that this part of the judgment can or should be upheld on account of the
    delay in making the payment or the use to which the money was put prior to
    payment, claims of a fundamentally different character than were advanced
    at trial. Accordingly, that portion of the judgment is set aside.</p>
  <h2>2.         Purchase of sisters’ shares</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the majority shareholders breached their fiduciary
    obligations by purchasing the sisters’
    shares.  He found that the majority shareholders had failed to have prepared
    a shareholders’ agreement as required by the mother’s will, and that by purchasing
    the shares to give themselves a greater interest than BWT in the company,
    they were in breach of the terms of the will and the BWT.  The trial judge
    ordered that upon payment of $37,500 to the majority shareholders, the respondents
    were to be declared owner’s of one quarter of the shares purchased from the
    sisters. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred with respect to this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    the terms of the will nor the terms of the BWT preclude the majority shareholders
    from purchasing the shares or from owning a larger proportion of the shares
    in the company than the minority shareholders.  The majority shareholders
    can certainly be faulted for failing to prepare and execute a shareholder’s
    agreement.  On the other hand, the will does not specify the terms of such
    an agreement beyond stating that it is to provide for “the purchase by shareholders
    of shares of a deceased shareholder or a shareholder desiring to sell”, the
    precise terms being left to the discretion of the testator’s solicitor.  The
    will also permits the acquisition of further shares provided the terms of
    the transaction are approved by named lawyers and/or accountants. No formal
    approval was obtained but the lawyer named in the will was involved in the
    transaction. The terms of the BWT permitted the majority shareholders as
    its trustees to deal with the trust property “in any manner they may consider
    proper” and to “generally act in respect of the trust fund as fully and effectively
    from time to time as if the same were not trust property but always for the
    benefit of the trust fund.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the majority shareholders purchased their sisters’ shares for $150,000, the
    company was in precarious financial straights teetering on bankruptcy.  The
    majority shareholders assert that given the financial difficulty in which
    the company found itself, it would have been improvident for the BWT to acquire
    the sisters’
    shares.  While the investment subsequently proved to be sound, largely because
    of the efforts of the majority shareholders, at the time the shares were
    purchased, it was far from clear that it would be.  They say that the beneficiaries
    of the BWT were aware of the purchase of the sisters’ shares and aware of
    the company’s precarious financial situation and that the failure of the
    beneficiaries to complain at the time provides strong evidence that it was
    not in the best interests of BWT to participate in the transaction. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that the trial judge failed to consider the compelling evidence concerning
    the conduct of the beneficiaries of the BWT that supports the position taken
    by the majority shareholders.  The investment in the sisters’ shares was
    risky and there was an entirely plausible reason for not exposing the BWT
    to that risk.  It is clear from the record that the BWT beneficiaries knew
    of the purchase of the sisters’ shares from 1989 at the latest. They made
    no complaint.  Nor did they raise any objection or complaint upon the passing
    of the accounts of the estate in 1996 when the transaction was fully disclosed.  The
    failure of the beneficiaries to complain of the purchase at a time when it
    remained a risky investment in a company facing an uncertain future provides
    cogent evidence in support of the majority shareholders’ contention that
    it was not in the best interests of the BWT beneficiaries to put more money
    into the company.  In our view, it would be unfair and unjust to allow the
    BWT beneficiaries to reverse their position and now assert this claim with
    the benefit of full hindsight.  Accordingly, we allow this aspect of the
    appeal.</p>
  <h2>3.         Management compensation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    company was involved in protracted litigation with another company from the
    beginning of 1987 to the end of 1994.  During that time the majority shareholders
    received no remuneration for their work.  An injunction issued in the litigation,
    which remained in place until 1991, prevented remuneration being paid to
    them. When the injunction was lifted there was not sufficient cash flow until
    1995 for them to take remuneration.  In later years, a portion of the remuneration
    paid to the three majority shareholders was attributed to retroactive payment
    of management compensation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the management compensation paid to the majority shareholders
    constituted oppressive conduct toward the minority shareholders and was excessive.  He
    provided cogent and detailed reasons for his conclusions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    retroactive compensation was oppressive because it had not been properly
    disclosed to the minority shareholders. It was, he said, a disguised dividend.  Each
    of the three majority shareholders had taken the same amount of compensation,
    despite having provided services of substantially different value to the
    company.  The expert witnesses called by both sides agreed excessive management
    compensation had been paid, though they differed on the amount and on whether
    the fact the majority shareholders had provided personal guarantees of the
    company’s indebtedness should be considered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants attack the trial judge's conclusion that the overpayment of management
    compensation amounted to $2,266,442.55, amended on consent to $2,179,092.55.  They
    submit that although they had worked without compensation from 1987 to 1994,
    the trial judge allowed retroactive compensation beginning only in 1991.  The
    trial judge explained he began the reconciliation in 1991 because he saw
    no reason why the majority shareholders should be able to retroactively seek
    compensation for a period when they were subject to an injunction preventing
    them from paying themselves any compensation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would dismiss this aspect of the appeal.  The trial judge’s quantification
    of the amount of the excessive compensation is essentially a finding of fact.  His
    decision not to allow compensation to be attributed prior to 1991 was reasoned
    and supported by logic.  His findings that the retroactive compensation was
    both oppressive and excessive had ample evidentiary support.</p>
  <h4>Cross-appeal</h4>
  <h2>1.         Prejudgment interest</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave brief reasons for refusing to award prejudgment interest.  He
    held that as the majority shareholders had worked without compensation for
    six years in the 1980s and without their efforts no one would have benefited
    from the success of the corporation, no prejudgment interest should be awarded.  He
    added that while it would have been open to award interest on the amount
    to be paid back to the company, he saw no reason to do so as that would simply
    result in a <i>pro rata</i> distribution to all parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the treatment of interest must be tailored to the particular circumstances
    of this case and the nature of the remedy ordered by the trial judge.  The
    trial judge ordered the majority shareholders notionally to repay to the
    company the excessive management compensation they received.  That notional
    repayment will have the effect of increasing the value of the company for
    the purpose of determining the fair compensation to the minority shareholders
    for the value of its interest.  In these circumstances, we agree with the
    majority shareholders that the minority shareholders are not entitled to
    prejudgment interest on any amount the majority shareholders are required
    to repay to the company.  However, we can see no reason why the notional
    payment by majority shareholders should not include interest on the excessive
    compensation they received, with appropriate adjustments for any advance
    payments.  They have had the benefit of that money to which they are not
    entitled and unless they are required to pay interest, neither the company
    nor the minority shareholders will be made whole.  We agree with the trial
    judge that this will result in a <i>pro rata</i> distribution to all parties.  However,
    the trial judge offered no legal justification for rejecting what appears
    to us to be the appropriate and just result.  Accordingly we would allow
    the prejudgment interest appeal to the extent of adjusting the notional repayment
    to include interest at the prevailing chartered bank prime lending rate on
    the excessive management compensation they received.</p>
  <h2>2.         Costs</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that although the methods used by the majority shareholders
    amounted to oppression, they had assumed significant risks and their conduct
    had benefitted the minority shareholders.  He concluded that in the circumstance
    of the case, it would be not be appropriate for the majority shareholders
    to bear all of the costs of the action, but that the costs should be spread
    among all the parties.  To accomplish this objective he ordered that the
    costs be paid by the company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    this order is unusual and perhaps unorthodox, in the particular circumstances
    of this case we would not disturb it.  Had the trial judge simply fixed the
    costs at a reduced percentage to reflect his overall assessment of the justice
    of the case, this court would not have interfered. In practical terms, that
    is the effect of the order he made.  The successful party will still receive
    a significant measure of partial indemnity for the costs of the action. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge erred in principle by refusing to award
    substantial indemnity costs.  The trial judge stated erroneously that there
    was no offer to settle.  However, we are not persuaded that consideration
    of the offer leads to a different disposition as to costs.  Subrule 49.10(3)
    provides that the burden of proving that the judgment is as favourable as
    the terms of the offer to settle rests upon the party who claims the benefit
    of the rule.  We are not satisfied that that burden has been discharged,
    particularly in view of our disposition of the issue of the sisters’ shares.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    substantial indemnity costs may be awarded in an oppression action, a trial
    judge retains a discretion in that regard and we see no error in principle
    in the trial judge's refusal to award substantial indemnity costs in the
    circumstances of this case. </p>
