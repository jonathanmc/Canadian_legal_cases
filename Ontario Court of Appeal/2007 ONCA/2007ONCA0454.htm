    attacked two of the particular claims of negligence against it, namely that
    it was negligent in passing a regulation in 1990 that permitted the inclusion

    facts begin with the plaintiff Sauer, one of approximately 100,000 cattle
    farmers in the proposed class. His cattle business suffered severe economic
    losses because of the closing of the foreign borders caused by the infection
    of the

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta included ruminant meat and bone meal (“RMBM”). RMBM consists of the
    remains of cattle and other ruminants. It is alleged that the feed manufactured
    by Ridley was contaminated with BSE because it contained RMBM from infected
    cattle. This feed was fed to the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    a serious outbreak of BSE in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, Canada introduced
    a requirement in 1987 that all cattle imported from the UK be from herds
    certified to be free of BSE. In 1990, this was elevated to a ban on the importation
    of live cattle from the

    In <i>Childs</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada made clear that proximity will
    not always be satisfied by reasonable foreseeability. Rather, it requires
    an assessment of factors arising from the relationship between the parties
    other than foreseeability, but including questions of policy in the broad

    34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Essentially, these are factors that allow us to

    arise. However, as in this case, where the plaintiff concedes that the relationship

    motion judge concluded that it was not plain and obvious that Sauer’s assertion
    of such a duty of care would fail. At the first stage of the analysis, he
    found that the harm alleged by Sauer was a reasonably foreseeable consequence
    of Ridley’s conduct, and that there was sufficient proximity between them
    that it was not plain and obvious that Sauer’s claim of a <i>prima facie</i> duty

    this court, Ridley does not seriously contend that Sauer’s losses were not
    the reasonably foreseeable consequence of its manufacture of contaminated
    feed. Indeed, Sauer pleads that Ridley was in fact aware of the risk of transmission
    of BSE to healthy cattle from their incorporation of contaminated RMBM into
    their feed, and that a confirmed diagnosis of the disease in a single Canadian
    cow would lead to border closings. At this point, that must be taken as fact.</p>

    argues that Sauer’s claim must fail because Sauer admits that his claim falls

    withstand the greater scrutiny reserved for claims of economic loss.</p>

    claim for greater scrutiny is easily answered. The Supreme Court of Canada
    makes clear in both <i>Cooper</i>, <i>supra</i> (which itself was about economic
    loss) and <i>Childs, supra</i>, that where a duty of care is alleged in a
    novel situation the principled approach of the two-stage analysis is to be
    applied. Creating special hurdles for a claim of economic loss is not warranted. </p>

    main argument is that there is simply no proximity between it and Sauer and
    therefore it is plain and obvious that it owes no <i>prima facie</i> duty
    of care in these circumstances. Ridley’s position is that since Sauer did
    not purchase or use its feed, it and Sauer are strangers to each other for
    the purposes of the proximity analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree. In essence, Sauer argues that the proximity examination must
    be done keeping in mind the circumstances relevant to the cause of action
    being alleged. The relationship of commercial cattle farmers and cattle feed
    manufacturers must be examined in the context of the manufacture of feed
    contaminated with BSE. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this light, Sauer says that he and Ridley are part of one integrated industry,
    from the supply of feed through to the sale of cattle. Beyond this economic
    link, Sauer points out that there is a regulatory link: the feed component
    of the industry is regulated nationally in the interests of the participants
    in it and the public. Most importantly, the catastrophic economic consequences
    of BSE contamination due to a single infected cow are shared by all commercial
    cattle farmers. Foreign sales are eliminated for all. This economic catastrophe
    dwarfs the impact of the loss of one cow on the cattle farmer who purchased
    the Ridley feed. In this critical way, all commercial cattle farmers are
    linked to Ridley as the victims of feed contaminated by BSE.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    it is reasonably foreseeable to Ridley that manufacturing contaminated feed
    will cause catastrophic losses, Sauer argues that it is just and fair to
    impose the cost of those losses on Ridley. After all, Ridley derives its
    business success from selling its feed to commercial cattle farmers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    feed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    this issue, I think the case of <i>Hoffman v. Monsanto Canada Inc</i>., 2007
    SKCA 47, released May 2, 2007, is of little assistance. The finding in that
    case of insufficient proximity to give rise to a <i>prima facie</i> duty
    of care turns on the particular facts pleaded and on the test for certifying
    a class action, which was found to be different from the “plain and obvious” test
    applicable here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    my view, it is not plain and obvious that Sauer’s claim in this regard will
    fail. In some ways, it responds to the language of Lord Atkin in the case
    that gave birth to the concept of proximity, <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>,
    [1932] A.C. 562 at 596:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The nature of the thing may very well call for
    different degrees of care, and the person dealing with it may well contemplate
    persons as being within the sphere of his duty to take care who would not
    be sufficiently proximate with less dangerous goods; so that not only the
    degree of care but the range of persons to whom a duty is owed may be extended.</p>

    also argues that even if Sauer establishes a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care,
    it is plain and obvious that Sauer’s claim will fail at the second stage
    of the duty of care  analysis. It says that there are residual policy considerations
    which mandate this result. </p>

normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    I disagree. It is to be remembered that at this point we have only the statement
    of claim. Ridley has not filed a defence. In <i>Childs</i>, <i>supra, </i>the
    court said that at the second stage, the defendant (in this case Ridley)
    bears the evidentiary burden of showing countervailing policy considerations
    sufficient to negate the <i>prima facie</i> duty of care. It is for this
    reason that this court has said that it should be circumspect in determining
    so early in an action that residual policy considerations make it plain and
    obvious that there is no duty of care. See <i>Haskett v. Equifax Canada Inc.</i> (2003),
    63 O.R. (3d) 577 at para. 24 (

    nonetheless argues that the claim raises the spectre of unlimited liability
    to an unlimited class. However, this is hard to sustain given that the statement
    of claim quantifies both the size of the class and the quantum of the loss
    of each class member. If this argument really is that the economic consequences
    of the contaminated feed ripple out beyond commercial cattle farmers to others
    in a way that cannot be circumscribed, that will be for Ridley to establish.</p>

    also argues that to recognize this duty of care will necessarily impact all
    legal relationships between manufacturers and product users. However, the
    proximity analysis that underpins the duty of care claimed by Sauer depends
    very much on the circumstances of the case. Without some demonstrated foundation,
    Ridley’s concern remains speculation.</p>

    Ridley raises as a residual policy consideration the fact that federal government
    regulations expressly permitted it to do what it did and argues that this
    would negate any <i>prima facie </i>duty of care. However, it is not an answer
    for Ridley that its use of RMBM in the feed it manufactured was permitted
    under federal regulations. The legislative policy reflected in those regulations
    relates to the standard of care that may be required to meet an existing
    duty of care, not to the question of whether a duty of care exists in the
    first place. See <i>Ryan v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Victoria (City)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 201 at para. 27. So far as <i>Hoffman</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    applies a similar government policy to negate a <i>prima facie </i>duty of
    care, I would respectfully decline to follow it. The two-stage analysis of
    the duty of care issue does not concern itself with government policy that
    may well be relevant to the conduct required to meet an existing duty, but
    does not speak to the existence of the duty itself.</p>

      is analogous to the categories of cases where courts have previously sustained
      a duty to warn. Sauer was neither a purchaser nor a user of Ridley’s product.
      No case has imposed on a manufacturer a duty to someone who neither purchased

      my view, there are two related reasons why the claim for such a duty of
      care is bound to fail at the first stage of the analysis. Apart from foreseeability,
      Sauer cannot establish sufficient proximity between Ridley and himself
      when that assessment is made in the context of this cause of action, namely
      the duty to Sauer to warn purchasers and users of feed manufactured by

      any warning by Ridley would have had no impact on Sauer’s conduct. Since
      he neither purchased nor used Ridley’s product, a warning would never have
      come to his attention. The basis upon which the law imposes a duty to warn
      simply cannot be served because of the insufficient proximity, for the
      purposes of this cause of action, between Sauer and Ridley. In other words,
      when a duty to Sauer to warn others is being considered, the relationship
      between Ridley and commercial cattle farmers in Ridley’s position is not
      sufficiently close that the policy basis for imposing a duty to warn can
      be served. In <i>Economic Negligence</i>: <i>The Recovery of Pure Economic
      Loss</i>, 4th ed. (

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A manufacturer’s duty to warn
      of known dangers associated with its products is premised on safety concerns.
      The premise of the duty ought to control its ambit. Thus, the duty should
      extend to those persons who are in a position to respond to the warning,
      and hence to reduce the safety risk. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the duty to warn is designed to reduce the safety risk through voluntary
      compliance. No warning can compel perfect compliance. Yet in circumstances
      like these, a single noncompliant cattle farmer feeding a single cow can
      produce catastrophic economic consequences for commercial cattle farmers
      in Sauer’s position. Since a warning cannot compel compliance by all, the
      risk of harm to commercial cattle farmers would hardly be different whether
      or not Ridley was obliged to warn. Thus, in these circumstances, imposing
      a duty on Ridley to commercial cattle farmers to warn purchasers and users
      would have little, if any, impact on the harm suffered by those farmers.
      In my view, it would be irrational for the law to do so. It would be neither
      just nor fair where the duty imposed is so unrelated to the harm suffered.
      Sauer’s claim cannot therefore survive the first stage of the proximity

    legislative decisions – one to regulate in a certain way, and one not to
    regulate until a certain date – and that, as such, it is plain and obvious
    that neither can attract tort liability. </span></p>

      disagree that, at this stage of the proceedings, this conclusion is plain

      is no doubt that Sauer’s assertion of a private law duty of care on
    <st1:country-region

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    does not seriously contest the foreseeability requirement. However, it does
    argue that there can be no relationship of sufficient proximity between commercial
    cattle farmers in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    when

      the other hand, Sauer argues that he has pleaded the facts required to
      show sufficient proximity between
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and commercial cattle farmers to raise a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care.
    In particular, he points to the many public representations by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    that it regulates the content of cattle feed to protect commercial cattle
    farmers among others. He says this shows that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    was acting with their interests in mind rather than the broad public interest.
    Sauer says that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s public assumption of a duty to Canadian cattle farmers to ensure the safety
    of cattle feed yields the conclusion that it is not plain and obvious that
    his claim of a <i>prima facie </i>duty of care will not succeed. I agree. </span></p>

      to the second stage of the analysis, Sauer pleads that these were not policy
      decisions but were operational, and that this therefore negates
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s major reason for saying that Sauer’s complaints cannot survive this stage
    of the duty of care analysis. Given that the evidentiary onus at this stage
    is on
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , and that at this early point in the proceedings it has brought forward
    nothing, I agree. </span></p>

      Sauer argues that, even if
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s two decisions are taken to be policy decisions, they were exercises of
    the discretion to regulate or not given to it by the governing legislation
    in each case. He then pleads in detail why these two decisions must be taken
    to have been made in bad faith. That notion was described in <i>Entreprises
    Sibeca v. Frelighsburg (Municipality)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 304 at para.
    26, as encompassing legislative decisions so markedly inconsistent with the
    relevant legislative context that it cannot be concluded that they were performed
    in good faith. On the basis of this case, Sauer argues that as a result of
    bad faith,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s decisions cannot claim the immunity that might otherwise attach to an
    exercise of legislative power.</span></p>

      Sauer’s pleadings in this respect, I do not think that it is plain and

      Canada</st1:country-region>

      <st1:place

    ’s attack on these two claims must fail. It is not plain and obvious at this

      have therefore concluded that all three appeals should be dismissed. This
      leaves undisturbed the disposition of costs at first instance. As to costs
