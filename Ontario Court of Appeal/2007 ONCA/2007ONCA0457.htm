    a trial before a jury in February 1996, the appellant was convicted of five
    sexual offences against his step-daughters, A.S. and P.S.  The convictions
    arose from the appellant’s ongoing sexual abuse of the two complainants,
    A.S. and P.S., during a period of approximately three years when he was married
    to their mother.  During this period, A.S. was between twelve and sixteen

  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant is the complainants’ former step-father.  He married their mother,
    Ms. C., in 1984, when A.S. was thirteen years old and P.S. was nine years
    old.  Ms. C. and the appellant had a violent relationship.  They both drank
    heavily, and the appellant physically abused Ms. C. on numerous occasions.  They
    divorced in 1988.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A.S.
    testified that the appellant sexually assaulted her numerous times, beginning
    several months before he married her mother.  The incidents occurred at night,
    when the appellant would go into A.S.’s bedroom after he had been drinking
    heavily or taking drugs.  On several occasions, the appellant held a knife
    to her throat while assaulting her.  He told A.S. not to tell anyone about
    the assaults, and threatened to kill her or her mother if she did.  The assaults
    began with touching but progressed to intercourse on several occasions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.S.
    testified that the appellant repeatedly sexually assaulted her.  She described
    several incidents similar to those described by A.S. – the appellant would
    go into her bedroom at night, assault her, and threaten to kill her or her
    mother if she told anyone.  These incidents consisted of touching and cunnilingus.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.S.
    also testified about an incident that occurred in the living room of the
    house.  The appellant and Ms. C. were at a neighbour’s house and took turns
    returning home to check on the children.  P.S. testified that the appellant
    came home and entered her bedroom.  The next thing she remembered was being
    on the couch, with the appellant lying on top of her.  He pulled down her
    underwear and pyjama bottoms, and told her to be quiet.  At this point, Ms.
    C. returned home.  Ms. C. confirmed during her testimony that she had returned
    to the house because the appellant had been gone longer than expected.  She
    saw the appellant lying on top of P.S., pulling up her pyjama bottoms.  Ms.
    C. confronted the appellant about this incident but he denied that he had
    done anything wrong.  He told her that he was trying to put P.S. to bed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    A.S. and P.S. shared a bedroom during much of the period when the assaults
    occurred, neither recalled hearing or seeing the other being assaulted.  A.S.
    testified that she only became aware that the appellant had sexually assaulted
    P.S. when they discussed it years later.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainants did not report the appellant’s assaults on them until 1994,
    after he was charged with a then-recent sexual assault against his fourteen-year
    old nephew.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a trial with a jury, the appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting A.S.;
    having sexual intercourse with A.S. when she was under fourteen years of
    age; having illicit sexual intercourse with A.S., who was his step-daughter;
    sexually assaulting P.S.; and, while sexually assaulting P.S., threatening
    to cause bodily harm to her mother.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the charge to the jury was flawed in that the trial
    judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>1.         failing to instruct the jury properly in relation to bad character
    evidence and to not use each complainant’s evidence as proof of the other’s
    allegations;</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>2.         inadequately instructing the jury on reasonable doubt; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>3.         failing to instruct the jury on the proper use of witnesses’ prior
    statements.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE CONVICTION APPEAL <i></i></span></h4>
  <h4>Bad character </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the fairness of his trial was compromised by the jury’s
    improper exposure to evidence of his bad character.  There are two prongs
    to this argument.  First, the appellant submits that because the charges
    relating to A.S. and P.S. were tried together, the jury may have used each
    complainant’s testimony as support for the other’s.  In this regard, the
    appellant points out that the Crown invited the jury to “consider the similarities” of
    the appellant’s alleged acts and words according to the complainants.  As
    no similar fact evidence ruling was made, the jury should have been instructed
    that this line of reasoning was prohibited.  A related criticism of the Crown
    closing to the jury flowed from the fact that Crown counsel said “There was
    no suggestion that they [the complainants] even ever talked about their experiences.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the jury may have made improper use of the complainants’ testimony
    that he physically abused Ms. C.  He says that the trial judge erred by failing
    to instruct the jury not to use this bad character evidence to infer that
    he was the type of person who was likely to commit the offences with which
    he was charged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown contends that the charge to the jury, while not perfect, contained
    sufficient limiting instructions to ensure that the jury would consider the
    evidence on each count separately.  Further, the appellant’s assaults on
    Ms. C. were not sufficiently similar to the offences with which he was charged
    to lead the jury to convict on the basis that he was the sort of person who
    was likely to have committed the offences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I explain, in my view, neither of the errors identified by the appellant
    compromised the fairness of his trial or resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. M.(B.)</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353, this court summarised the instruction
      that should be given where there are multiple counts and complainants and
      the evidence on one count is not admissible as similar fact evidence on
      the other counts.  First, jurors are to be instructed
    “to consider each charge separately and not to use evidence relating to one
    count as evidence on any of the other counts”.  Second, the jury must be
    instructed that evidence of other counts should not be used as proof that
    the accused “is the sort of person who would commit the offence or offences
    charged” (paras. 41-42).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s instructions to the jury in this case satisfied the first requirement
    set out in <i>M.(B.)</i>.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>First of all, I tell you as a matter of law you
    must deal separately with respect to the evidence as it relates to each of
    the complainants, that is, you cannot find that since the accused sexually
    assaulted one of the complainants he must therefore have sexually assaulted
    the other.  You must look at the evidence with respect to each of the complainants
    to determine whether you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    accused committed the offences with respect to each complainant. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The instruction largely resembled
    that which the trial judge had proposed in a pre-charge discussion and to
    which neither counsel objected.  This instruction makes it clear that the
    jury was required to consider the question of whether the appellant assaulted
    A.S. separately from the question of whether he assaulted P.S.  Although
    no specific reference was made to Crown counsel’s misstatement asking the
    jury to consider similarities in the evidence of the two complainants, the
    jury was told by both counsel in their closings and by the judge that they
    were to take the law from the judge.  As the Crown concedes, it would have
    been preferable had the trial judge instructed the jury to consider the evidence
    relating to each count separately, rather than the evidence relating to each
    complainant.  However, although different verdicts were available in law
    on the individual counts relating to the complainants, this was largely theoretical
    as both sides approached the case on an “all or nothing basis”.  Thus, the
    instruction adequately conveyed the first requirement in <i>M.(B.)</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the second requirement in <i>M.(B.), </i>although the trial judge
    did not use the suggested language, his charge adequately warned the jury
    against engaging in propensity reasoning.  It is well established that the
    trial judge must direct the jury that it cannot enter a conviction on the
    basis that the accused is the “sort of person” who would commit the type
    of offence charged: <i>R. v. B.(F.F.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 112 at 138-9
    (S.C.C.).  It would have been preferable for the trial judge to use the language
    of <i>B.(F.F.)</i>.  However, the trial judge’s instructions explained to
    the jury that it could convict the appellant only on the basis of the evidence
    relating to each offence charged.  The instruction that “you cannot find
    that since the accused sexually assaulted one of the complainants he must
    therefore have sexually assaulted the other” would have left the jury with
    the understanding that guilt on one count (or with respect to one complainant)
    could not be used to infer guilt on another.  Limiting instructions given
    in respect of bad character evidence are intended to prevent the jury from
    inferring guilt from prior bad conduct.  The trial judge’s instructions served
    that purpose.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case is unlike <i>R. v. McDonald </i>(2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 273, in which
    this court held that the failure to instruct the jury not to engage in propensity
    reasoning on the basis of similar fact evidence was fatal.  In <i>McDonald</i>,
    in addition to failing to instruct on propensity reasoning, the judge told
    the jury that it could consider the similar fact evidence in determining
    whether the Crown had proved its case.  Hence, the need for a careful propensity
    warning was greatly intensified.  Here, the jury was not instructed that
    it could use each complainant’s evidence in assessing whether the Crown had
    proved the charges in relation to the other complainant.  On the contrary,
    the jury was instructed to keep the complainants’
    evidence separate, except on background details. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also submits that the charge was confusing because, after stating
    that the evidence with respect to each complainant had to be considered separately,
    the trial judge stated that each complainant’s evidence that she did not
    hear or see the assaults on the other could be relevant to credibility.  In
    my view, this instruction was neither confusing nor incorrect.  It had been
    discussed with counsel in the pre&#8209;charge conference without objection
    and, each complainant was allegedly present during many of the assaults on
    the other.  Thus, A.S.’s testimony about what she perceived (or did not perceive)
    during the assaults on P.S. was direct evidence on the counts concerning
    P.S., and <i>vice versa</i>.  The impugned instruction was of assistance
    to the defence and consistent with defence counsel’s jury address.  It served
    to remind the jury that neither complainant had observed the other being
    assaulted despite being in the room at the time of the assaults and supported
    the defence theory that the complainants’ evidence was not credible or reliable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the comment that the Crown made in closing that the complainants
    had not talked about their experiences, it was conceded that there was some
    evidence that the complainants had discussed their allegations.  However,
    the jury would have been aware of that matter and had been instructed that
    it was their job to determine the facts on the evidence that they accepted.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    while it would have been preferable had the trial judge instructed the jury
    that they were not to conclude from the evidence of spousal abuse and drunkenness
    that the appellant was the sort of person likely to commit the offences charged,
    in my view it is not fatal.  The way in which the evidence of spousal abuse
    was adduced was not inflammatory.  It was no more specific than that the
    appellant often beat Ms. C.  It is unlikely that the jury would infer that
    because the appellant physically abused his wife, he also sexually assaulted
    his step-daughters – a completely different type of wrongdoing.  This court
    held in <i>R. v. M.(R.)</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 3922 at para. 9 that where the
    accused husband and wife had been convicted of sexual assault and assault
    against their children, evidence that they abused drugs and alcohol was not
    sufficiently related to lead the jury to infer their guilt.  Similar reasoning
    applies in this case.  </p>
  <h4>Reasonable Doubt</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal arises from the trial judge’s charge to the jury
    on reasonable doubt.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s opening instructed the jury not to be “swayed by indignation,
    prejudice or sympathy”.  He told the jury to weigh the evidence calmly and
    dispassionately.  In his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury on the
    presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I tell you as a matter of law that the accused is
    presumed to be innocent and that the presumption of innocence remains unless
    and until the Crown has proven every element of the offences beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  This is not a charity given to this accused but an important legal
    principle that applies in all criminal cases.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been achieved
    when you feel sure of the guilt of the accused, that is, when the evidence
    convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience.  Let me repeat that for
    you.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been achieved when you feel sure
    of the guilt of the accused, when the evidence convinces the mind and satisfies
    the conscience.  Henceforth, when I speak of proof, it is this degree of
    proof of which I speak.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, there is no obligation on the accused to prove
    anything.  In order to obtain a conviction, the Crown must prove its case
    beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Your function is to give a true verdict on the evidence.  You
    will consider the case without any bias or prejudice, in a dispassionate
    way.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If you find the Crown has proved its case, you will
    convict the accused.  On the other hand, if you feel the Crown has not proved
    its case, or you have a reasonable doubt about it, you will acquit the accused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that this instruction failed to meet the standard set out
    in <i>R. v. Lifchus </i>(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  Specifically,
    he argues that the trial judge’s direction that the jury should “feel sure
    of the guilt of the accused”
    is contrary to Cory J.’s assertion in <i>Lifchus</i> that jurors should not
    be told to convict if they are “sure” that the accused is guilty before being
    given a proper definition of reasonable doubt.  The appellant submits the
    trial judge also erred by omitting several of the descriptions of reasonable
    doubt listed in <i>Lifchus</i>, including that it must be based upon reason,
    must be logically connected to the evidence or absence thereof, must not
    be understood as proof to an absolute certainty, and must be more than proof
    that the accused is probably guilty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown notes that, as the trial judge did not have the benefit of <i>Lifchus </i>at
    the time of trial, his instructions on reasonable doubt need only be in substantial
    compliance with it.  On that basis, she submits that the charge to the jury
    was adequate.  She concedes that the instruction did not contain an instruction
    that probable guilt was not sufficient to ground a conviction, but says that
    this error would not have led the jury to misapprehend the standard of proof.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para. 23, the Supreme Court
      states that a jury charge must be “examined in its entirety to determine
      whether the jury properly understood the concept of proof beyond a reasonable
      doubt”.  Following <i>Starr</i>, in <i>R. v. Russell</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
      731, the Supreme Court further clarified how appeal courts are to approach
      a pre&#8209;<i>Lifchus</i> charge on reasonable doubt.   At para. 23 it
      states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The appellate assessment of substantial compliance
    with the <i>Lifchus</i> principles in cases where the trial judge did not
    have the benefit of that decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge,
    language that will likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts
    recommended in <i>Lifchus</i>, is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a
    judgment call on whether deficiencies in the charge fall below the <i>Lifchus</i> standard
    such as to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict,
    and lead to the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, when read as a whole, the instructions on reasonable doubt were
    adequate and met that test.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching this view, I begin by noting the ways in which the instruction is
    in compliance with <i>Lifchus</i>.  The following summary is drawn, in part,
    from para. 44 of the Crown’s factum.  <i>Lifchus </i>says that the jury should
    be told that:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with
    that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence.  The
    trial judge explained that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    is linked to the presumption of innocence, which prevails in all criminal
    cases.  Thus, the charge linked the two concepts adequately.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts
    to the accused.  The jury was well-instructed on this as it was told that
    the presumption of innocence remained unless and until the Crown had proved
    every element of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the accused
    had no obligation to prove anything. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    reasonable doubt is not a doubt based on sympathy or prejudice.  The jury
    was told to consider the case without bias or prejudice, in a dispassionate
    way.  Furthermore, in his opening remarks, the trial judge told the jury
    not to be swayed by indignation, prejudice or sympathy, and to weigh the
    evidence calmly and dispassionately.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury verdict is to be based on reason and common sense.  The jury was told
    that the Crown had only proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt when “the
    evidence convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience”.  Thus, while not
    fully compliant with this requirement, the trial judge did exclude an irrational
    conviction.  While the language differs from that suggested in <i>Lifchus</i>,
    it conveys the principle that the standard of proof is connected to the evidence.  Further,
    the trial judge’s later direction to the jury to “give a true verdict on
    the evidence” would have reminded jurors of the importance of basing their
    verdict on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    reasonable doubt is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.  The
    jury was told of the former and, although there was no absence of evidence
    instruction, this was not a case that might have turned on an absence of
    evidence.   </p>

'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More
    is required of proof than that the accused is probably guilty.  The charge
    did not do this.  However, given the trial judge’s repeated instructions
    on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there is no risk that the jury misunderstood
    the standard of proof.  There was no suggestion that probable guilt was sufficient.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Describing
    the term “reasonable doubt” as an ordinary expression with no special meaning

    jurors to apply to their task the same standard of proof that they apply
    to important, or even the most important, decisions of their lives.  The

    it would have been preferable had the trial judge not directed the jury that
    they should be “sure” of the appellant’s guilt without first providing them
    with a proper definition of the meaning of the words “beyond a reasonable
    doubt”, this is an isolated mistake which, when considered in the light of
    the repeated references to reasonable doubt and the absence of other misleading
    terms, does not lead to any serious concern that the charge was unfair or
    that the jury misapprehended the burden of proof.</p>

    when the charge is considered as a whole and bearing in mind that the trial
    judge did not have the benefit of <i>Lifchus</i>, I am satisfied that the
    jury was under no misapprehension as to the correct standard of proof to
    apply.  My view is reinforced by the fact that counsel did not object to
    the instructions on this matter.     </p>
  <h4>Prior Statements</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on
    the proper use of witnesses’ prior statements.  He submits that two instructions
    were required.  First, the trial judge should have directed the jury that
    A.S.’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry that the appellant sexually assaulted
    her every other night could not be used for proof of its contents, but could
    weigh against her credibility because of its inconsistency with her trial
    testimony that he assaulted her approximately ten times.  Second, the appellant
    contends that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the appellant’s
    assertion to Ms. C. that he had not sexually assaulted P.S. during the incident
    in the living room could be used as proof of its contents.  Because Ms. C.
    testified about this statement while being examined by the Crown, it is admissible
    as an out of court exculpatory statement capable of raising a reasonable
    doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that the trial judge should have provided the instructions
    outlined by the appellant, but argues that, given the limited relevance of
    the prior statements, this non-direction did not affect the fairness of the
    trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept the Crown’s submission that the trial judge’s non-direction on witnesses’ prior
    statements did not result in an unfair trial.  The trial judge instructed
    the jury that when assessing the credibility of a witness, they could consider
    whether the “witness’ testimony was consistent within itself and whether
    it was consistent with the other evidence”.  This instruction would have
    made it clear to the jury that any inconsistencies in the evidence might
    be significant.  Although explicit reference should have been made to the
    proper use of inconsistencies in A.S.’s preliminary inquiry testimony, the
    instruction provided was sufficient to draw the jury’s attention to its potential
    importance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury not to use A.S.’s testimony at
    the preliminary inquiry as proof of its contents was also not significant
    in the context of this trial.  In his jury address, defence counsel did argue
    that the complainants were “aggressive and evasive with their answers”, and
    outlined several examples of this, but not the inconsistency that the appellant
    now says that the trial judge should have brought to the jury’s attention.  Since
    A.S. herself explained that her preliminary inquiry testimony should be understood
    as meaning only that the appellant came in to the room almost every night,
    not that he assaulted her every night, there was little danger that the jury
    would make substantive use of the earlier statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury that they could use the appellant’s
    statement to Ms. C. that he had not sexually assaulted P.S. as proof of its
    contents would not have caused unfairness in the trial process.  It was apparent
    that the appellant denied, and had always denied, that the sexual assaults
    took place.  As no instruction was given not to use the statement for the
    truth of its content, the jury may well have considered it as consistent
    with his position.  Furthermore, any instruction on the use of the statement
    could have had a prejudicial effect by highlighting the fact that the accused
    did not testify at the trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is important to note that defence counsel made no objection to the charge
    either after it was delivered or before at the pre charge conference.  Although
    the charge was not perfect by today’s standards, the fact that counsel was
    content at the time is a strong indication that there was no perception of
    unfairness or misunderstanding on the part of the jury.</p>

    long-term offender designation, there must be a “reasonable possibility of
    eventual control of the risk in the community” (s. 753.1(c)).  Given the
    law at the time of sentencing, this question was not addressed at that time.  As
    I explain below, however, on this record and in the absence of any fresh
    evidence to support a claim that the appellant might be a suitable candidate
    for a long-term offender designation, there is no such reasonable possibility
    and, consequently, I would not order a new sentencing hearing.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has a truly horrendous pattern of violence and sexual violence.  He
    has consistently denied responsibility for his sexual violence, shown a total
    lack of remorse for his offences, refused to acknowledge that he has a problem
    and refused all treatment, education and rehabilitative options.  His adult
    criminal record spans a thirty year period; it contains twenty-four prior
    convictions beginning in 1967 when he was sixteen years of age.  The appellant
    has a record for sexual assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and for
    repeatedly failing to comply with court orders.  The sexual assault causing
    bodily harm was perpetrated against the appellant’s 62-year-old neighbour;
    the sexual assault was perpetrated against his fourteen-year-old nephew.  He
    was convicted of at least nine criminal offences while subject to probation
    orders.</p>

    psychiatrists prepared court-ordered dangerous offender assessments: Dr.&nbsp;Hucker,
    the Crown nominated expert, and Dr. Bartolucci, the defence nominated expert.  The
    appellant refused to participate in either assessment.  Both Drs. Hucker
    and Bartolucci concluded that the appellant posed a high risk to re-offend
    violently or sexually.  Neither was of the view that the risk he presented
    could be controlled in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Hucker opined in his written report and <i>viva voce</i> testimony that the
    appellant’s speech pattern revealed a formal thought disorder consistent
    with a “major mental disorder” such as schizophrenia or a brain disease with
    similar symptoms.  He listed several factors which showed that the appellant
    was likely to reoffend violently or sexually, including his early history
    of maladjustment; his history of property, violent and sexual offences; his
    previous failures on conditional releases; and his history of alcohol abuse.  He
    also noted that the appellant’s score on the General Statistical Information
    of Recidivism index used by the National Parole Board indicated that he presented
    a 67% risk of committing an indictable offence within three years of release.  Although
    Dr. Hucker acknowledged that the appellant’s possible schizophrenia and previous
    marriage decreased his recidivism risk, he concluded that the “negative factors
    outweigh the positive”.  Further, he stated that the appellant’s “lack of
    insight and resolute refusal to cooperate with any kind of treatment substantially
    increases his risk”.  In his opinion, it would not be possible to successfully
    treat the appellant, in part because the appellant continued to refuse treatment.  He
    concluded that there were “ample grounds”
    on which to declare the appellant a dangerous offender.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Bartolucci, the defence expert, agreed with the substance of Dr. Hucker’s
    opinion but was even more pessimistic about the appellant’s recidivism risk.  In
    addition to the factors identified by Dr. Hucker, Dr. Bartolucci identified
    the appellant’s history of heterosexual and homosexual sexual assaults against
    individuals of various ages and circumstances, as well as his “obvious lack
    of judgment leading to overt and aggressive sexual acts independently of
    social context” as factors indicating that he was likely to reoffend.  Dr.
    Bartolucci did not agree that the positive factors identified by Dr. Hucker
    reduced the appellant’s recidivism risk.  He was unconvinced that the appellant’s
    marriage was based on a “true heterosexual interest in an adult”, saying
    that it was more likely motivated by the appellant’s sexual interest in Ms.&nbsp;C.’s
    children.  He also stated that the possible schizophrenic disorder would
    only be a positive factor if the appellant accepted treatment.  His written
    report concluded that the appellant “would certainly be noncompliant with
    any outpatient plan” and that “repeated violent sexual offences … [were]
    a certainty”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the expert testimony, the appellant’s former spouse, children
    (not the complainants) and other relatives testified regarding acts of violence
    and sexual assaults that were perpetrated by the appellant.  None of these
    incidents led to criminal convictions.  However, the trial judge accepted
    the witnesses’ evidence and stated that he was “satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt [the appellant] committed the acts testified to”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also found that, given the absence of any evidence indicating
    that the appellant might be amenable to psychiatric treatment, it was “highly
    unlikely” that he would ever consent to such therapy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven the dangerous offender requirements
    beyond a reasonable doubt and he declared the appellant to be a dangerous
    offender.  At the time of the dangerous offender hearing, the trial judge
    had the discretion under s. 753 of the <i>Code</i> to sentence the appellant
    to either a determinate or an indeterminate period of imprisonment.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  He explained his decision to impose an indeterminate
    sentence as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the evidence before me I am certain that if you
    were released you would continue to reoffend.  Your steadfast refusal to
    undergo any form of medical investigation, your continued denial of the offences
    for which you were found guilty by the jury at your trial, your lack of remorse,
    your total indifference and lack of emotion with respect to the pain, injury
    and anguish you have caused those who have come within your grasp, be they
    family, friend or stranger, all these factors convince me beyond a reasonable
    doubt that you constitute a continuing danger to the public. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has put forward no fresh evidence to suggest that a long-term offender
    designation was appropriate either at the time of sentence or today.  This
    despite the fact that more than ten years have passed since he was so designated,
    during which time there will have undoubtedly been treatment and other rehabilitative
    programmes offered to him.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the record to support the contention that the appellant may
    eventually be controlled in the community nor is there any fresh evidence
    to support such a contention.  The uncontradicted evidence of both expert
    witnesses was that the risk posed to the public by the appellant could not
    be controlled.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    this court has previously noted, an indeterminate sentence is not a sentence
    in perpetuity.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  If the appellant becomes amenable to treatment
    and his condition manageable in the community, he will be eligible to be
    considered for release on parole.  Unless that occurs, the dangerous offender
    designation is appropriate and required for the protection of the public.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    I would apply s.&nbsp;759(3)(b) of the <i>Code</i>, which allows this court
    to dismiss an appeal against the finding that the offender is a dangerous
    offender if it is satisfied that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
    has occurred.  Although the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>Johnson</i> that
    the failure to consider the availability of the long term offender provisions
    is an error that can be cured by s.&nbsp;753(3)(b) “only in the rarest of
    circumstances” (para. 50), in my view, this is such a case.  This court previously
    held in <i>R. v. Saddlemire</i>, 2007 ONCA 36 at paras.&nbsp;84&#8209;85
    that the curative proviso is available in cases where the long&#8209;term
    offender provisions were not considered if the evidence establishes that “the
    result would necessarily have been the same” had the error not occurred.  This
    case meets that standard.</p>
