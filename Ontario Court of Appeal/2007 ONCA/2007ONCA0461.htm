style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the custodial portion of his sentence for a series of sexual
    offences committed against three young complainants to whom he was in a position
    of trust.  Following his pleas of guilty, the sentencing judge sentenced
    the appellant to a global sentence of fourteen and a half years, reduced
    to twelve years incarceration by reason of his pre-sentence custody.  In
    imposing the sentence he did, the sentencing judge rejected a joint submission
    for a sentence in the range of seven to ten years less pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing
    to impose a sentence in the range jointly submitted by the Crown and defence
    counsel.  The appellant further submits that the sentencing judge failed
    to properly consider the appellant’s remorse as expressed by his guilty plea
    and at the sentencing hearing.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences took place over two distinct time periods.  The first time period
    involved offences committed while the appellant was a young person between
    1970-1975 and then as an adult between 1975-1981.  The second time period
    related to offences the appellant committed as an adult between 1995-2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, the three complainants are people towards whom the appellant
    was in a position of trust.  The offences committed from 1970-1981 involved
    the prolonged, frequent victimization of the appellant’s younger twin sisters,
    S.K. and S.E..  They included almost daily acts of fondling, masturbation,
    oral sex, and attempted vaginal intercourse.  The appellant was eight years
    older than his sisters; he started to abuse them when they were five or six
    years old and he was a teenager.  His abuse of them ended only when they
    became teenagers, threatened him, and left the house in which he resided.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Between
    1995 and 2002 the appellant also engaged in the prolonged, regular victimization
    of A.Q., the daughter of a woman with whom he lived in a relationship.  The
    assaults began when A.Q. was between four and six years old.  They included
    acts of fellatio and vaginal and anal intercourse, and were often accompanied
    by threats.  They occurred on an almost daily basis when A.Q.’s mother was
    out of the house and only ended when the appellant’s relationship with the
    mother ended.  At the time, A.Q.’s mother was not aware of this abuse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sexual assaults sometimes included physical violence. On one occasion when
    A.Q. was seven, she began to scream when the appellant came into her bedroom.  The
    appellant wrapped a towel around her throat and threatened to slit it.  On
    another, he cut A.Q.’s arm with a knife because she would not take her clothes
    off.  That cut left permanent scars on her bicep.  A.Q. was afraid to tell
    anyone about the assaults because she thought that the appellant would kill
    her if she did so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    count relating to the production of child pornography stemmed from a Polaroid
    photo taken by the appellant during an assault on A.Q.  The appellant also
    admitted to taking other photographs of her and to videotaping her while
    she performed oral sex on him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant pleaded guilty to a separate count of possession of child pornography.  170
    digital images were found on the appellant’s computers in a search executed
    by the police.  In addition, the police uncovered one box containing magazines
    and other child pornography materials, including the photo of A.Q.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal
    harassment charges in relation to the appellant’s son were withdrawn as part
    of the plea agreement.  Prior to this, the appellant had signed an undertaking
    that prohibited him from contacting his son, David, and had breached it on
    two occasions, once in person, and once via an internet chat room.  He pled
    guilty to these two breaches of his recognizance.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Sentencing Hearing</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of the complainants filed victim impact statements with the court at the
    sentencing, as did the mother of A.Q.  No other evidence was tendered by
    the Crown.  The appellant did not tender any evidence at the sentencing hearing.  No
    psychological report or pre-sentence report was filed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the Crown presented the joint submission at the hearing.  He sought a
    sentence at the high end of the seven to ten year range, submitting that
    the assaults against the three separate victims each called for a separate
    and distinct sentence.  He submitted that the more recent offences against
    A.Q. were the most serious and deserved a sentence in excess of five years.  This
    sentence was to be in addition to consecutive sentences with respect to the
    assaults against the appellant’s sisters, the suggested length of which the
    Crown did not enumerate, and eighteen months for the two child pornography
    offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the Crown’s submissions, the sentencing judge indicated that he had concerns
    with the joint submission in that the cases and arguments advanced by the
    Crown appeared to the sentencing judge to justify longer total terms than
    that proposed.  In particular, the sentencing judge opined that, in accordance
    with <i>R. v. D.(D.)</i> (2002)<i>, </i>163 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),<i> </i>he would be unable to apportion terms that adequately reflected
    the severity of the appellant’s different offences while remaining within
    the range proposed by counsel.  His concern was that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…if I accede to the Crown position of a sentence
    in the range of five years for the sexual assault matters, including a sexual
    assault with a weapon upon A.Q., of a five year sentence and then 18 months…
    for the production and possession of child pornography, then that only leaves,
    within the range, a total of three and one-half years to deal with all matters
    involving [the sisters] and, in fairness, the two breaches… don’t I run the
    risk of, in comparison, trivializing the matters involving [the sisters]… if

    the emotional effects of a trial.  In response to further submissions by
    the Crown, the sentencing judge reiterated his concern:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…if, within the range provided, I’d break out the
    offences individually as suggested then, for some of the victims, the numbers
    aren’t big and they can’t of necessity be big if I operate within the range
    absent a global disposition because then there simply… aren’t enough years
    involved to apportion the... sentence in a way that the numbers – that some
    of the numbers have a significance.  </p>

    counsel emphasized that the appellant was a young person when the offences
    began and that the early offences against his sisters did not involve full
    intercourse.  The appellant had only one prior unrelated offence on his criminal
    record, had completed high school and a college program and had held various
    jobs.  He was forty-eight years old at the time of sentencing. </p>

    counsel did not take a specific position as to which part of the agreed upon
    range was appropriate.  He indicated to the sentencing judge that the joint
    position was the product of lengthy discussions between himself and both
    the Crown Attorney’s Office and the investigating police officer.  He addressed
    the judge’s concern about the totality of the proposed sentence by emphasizing
    the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to all charges, a considerably
    mitigating factor to which he hoped the sentencing judge would give a “a
    great deal of credit”.  His position was that, regardless of what end of
    the agreed upon range the sentencing judge determined appropriate, the sentence
    would be substantial enough to give effect to the relevant sentencing principles. </p>

    the submissions of counsel, the sentencing judge asked the appellant if he
    would like to speak.  The appellant said he was really sorry for what he
    had done and that it was “very disgusting and personal that I took advantage
    of people and the trust.”  In response to these comments the sentencing judge
    asked the appellant when he came to this realization. He replied that it
    was when he lost his relationship with his son.  The sentencing judge clarified
    that the appellant had received a letter from one of his first victims explaining
    the horrible consequences that his sexual molestation had caused in her life
    before beginning the relationship with A.Q.’s mother, and that the appellant
    had written a response saying that he realized at that time that he had hurt
    people.  The sentencing judge indicated he did not understand how the appellant
    could go on to violently and persistently sexually assault A.Q. after this
    but say that he only gained insight into the offending behaviour when his
    relationship with his son faltered.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge identified general and specific deterrence as relevant sentencing
    principles.  He noted that sexual offences against children always require
    a sentence that contemplates general deterrence.  He determined that there
    was a need for specific deterrence here in light of the fact that the appellant
    had been informed of the impact of his earlier assaults on his sisters but
    he had nonetheless “re-offended” thirteen years later.  The sentencing judge
    also considered the fact that his sentence must contemplate rehabilitation.  He
    identified the appellant’s guilty plea as the lone mitigating factor and
    noted the aggravating factors – the age of the victims, the persistent and
    ongoing nature of the abuse, the extreme nature of the assaults, and the
    fact that each involved breaches of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge then turned to the joint submission.  The sentencing judge
    accepted the joint position of 2:1 credit for the fifteen months the appellant
    had spent in pre-sentence custody but did not accede to the agreed upon range
    of seven to ten years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    rejecting the joint submission, the sentencing judge made the following comments:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This matter was not judicially pre&#8209;tried and,
    prior to the pleas being entered no discussions were held with a judicial
    officer about disposition.  Other than what was said in open court, the only
    discussions had with counsel off the record were in chambers before the return
    to court following the lunch recess.  At that time, the discussion primarily
    dealt with the procedural aspect of Youth Criminal Justice Act matters and
    how they would be dealt with by way of amendments to the existing Information
    and new Informations being laid.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It was disclosed to me at that time the nature of
    the joint submission as well as the Crown and defence position of two&#8209;for&#8209;one
    time for pre&#8209;sentence custody.  Prior to the pleas being entered, there
    were no discussions with the judicial officer about the efficacy of the joint
    submission.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Joint submissions are to be granted <i>a great deal
      of deference by sentencing judges</i>.  The joint submission placed before
      me is for a range of seven to ten years in custody.  A sentencing judge
      is only entitled to reject a joint submission if it is an <i>error in principle</i>.  A
      great number of joint submissions deal with matters that are the usual
      sort of charges that courts often see.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The present matter is, in my opinion, not within
    that sort of offence, or offences, and is extremely unusual.  It involves,
    at the completion of this matter, in addition to the Youth Court matters
    which I’ve already dealt with, pleas to a total of 19 offences covering a
    chronological period from January 1<sup>st</sup> 1970 to March 22<sup>nd</sup>,
    2004 with a hiatus of charges from July 30<sup>th</sup>, 1981 to January
    1<sup>st</sup>, 1995.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I appreciate that a joint submission is placed before
    me by <i>extremely experienced counsel</i> in this matter but I am, on a
    very fundamental level, deeply troubled by the joint submission and I’m deeply
    troubled by it for a number of reasons.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While I am troubled by it, I am essentially bound
    by it unless <i>it is an error in principle</i> and, in my opinion, with
    a great deal of regret, I am obliged to advise both Crown and defence in
    this matter that I am of the opinion that the joint submission is an error
    in principle and, in my opinion, not in accordance with sentencing guidelines
    established by the Ontario Court of Appeal. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Referring
    to <i>R. v. D.(D.</i>), <i>supra</i>, he explained how this court has set
    a range of upper single digit to low double digit penitentiary terms for
    abuse of children by adults in positions of trust involving full intercourse
    on a regular and consistent basis over substantial periods of time, accompanied
    by violence or threats of violence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    determined that in these circumstances, the sexual assault of A.Q. standing
    alone fell within the guidelines, involving as it did threats and the use
    of a weapon in addition to the frequency, duration, and seriousness of the
    assaults.  For this he imposed a sentence of eleven years in custody in addition
    to 2:1 credit for fifteen months pre-sentence custody.  He stated “That essentially
    amounts to the rough equivalent of a maximum sentence.”  On the count of
    production of child pornography for making the videotape of A.Q. being forced
    to perform oral sex, he sentenced the appellant to one year to be served
    consecutively.  The sentences he imposed relating to the other victims ranged
    from five to seven and one half years and were imposed concurrently, as were
    the six month sentences for each breach of an undertaking.  The total sentence
    was effectively a fourteen year sentence. </p>

    make specific reference to the process leading up to the joint submission,
    namely, that there had been no pre-trial but a general discussion in the
    sentencing judge’s chambers where he was apprised in a general way of the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I note that the Court of Appeal makes no mention

    regardless of whether the accused has pled guilty.  Instead, in <i>D.(D.) </i>at
    paras.  26 - 27, Moldaver J.A. distinguished the situation from that in <i>R.

    hearing and pled guilty.  Moldaver J.A.’s comments as to the ranges of sentence
    were made in the context of rejecting the submission that <i>Stuckless </i>represented
    the high-water mark for sentences imposed on adult sex offenders who prey
    on young children and that a sentence no higher than six years should be
    imposed, as opposed to the global sentence of nine years and one month that

    authorities of this court and other courts make it clear that the sentencing
    of an accused is dependent upon the individual circumstances of the accused
    and the offence committed.  Here, in return for the Crown’s agreement to
    make a joint submission as to the range of sentence before the sentencing
    judge, the appellant gave up his right to a trial and pleaded guilty.  His
    plea of guilty spared his victims the horror of reliving their ordeal by
    having to testify.  As recently explained in <i>R. v. Druken</i>, [2006]
    N.J. No. 326<span
style='color:black'> </span>at para. 19 (S.C.(A.D.)), the assessment of the reasonableness
    of a proposed sentence must take into account the incentive that is necessary
    for the accused to plead guilty, which requires some adjustment down from
    the normal range of sentence to account for the accused’s decision to forgo
    his right to trial. </p>

    unlike the situation in <i>R. v. Dorsey</i>, <i>supra</i>, in this case the
    appellant did not have a prior criminal record of significance and had not
    served any prior lengthy period of incarceration.  Despite never having been
    adjudged guilty of the first set of sexual offences, the sentencing judge
    appears to have considered the appellant to be a repeat offender because
    of the gap between the first and second set of offences and because of the
    letter he had received from one of his sisters after the first set of offences.  Nor
    does he appear to credit the appellant’s expression of remorse as being sincere. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>D.(D.)</i>,
    the offences involved repeated and persistent acts of anal intercourse with
    young children over a seven year period together with the use of violence
    and death threats to gain compliance and to maintain secrecy.  They also
    involved deceit to gain the trust and confidence of the children’s parents
    and the use of corruptive means to groom the children, including exposing
    them to pornography.  The appellant did not give up his right to a trial
    and it was only at the sentencing hearing that an agreed statement of facts
    was reached in which he admitted culpability for the offences.  The global
    sentence of nine years, which the court upheld, was considered to be at the
    low end of the range having regard to the seriousness of the crimes and the
    harm caused to the victims.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the cumulative period is almost twenty years.  The appellant’s
    gross breach of trust involved a series of reprehensible assaults against
    his powerless young sisters, anal and vaginal intercourse with A.Q. accompanied
    by physical violence and threats, and the humiliation and degradation of
    having oral sex with him captured on a photograph and on videotape.  Having
    regard to the moral culpability of the appellant and the serious nature of
    these offences, I would hold that the lower end of the joint submission,
    namely, seven years, was so low as to be contrary to the public interest
    and to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  The upper end
    of the range suggested, namely, ten years, while at the low end of the range,
    is not, however, so low as to demand rejection when the appellant’s guilty
    plea is given appropriate weight. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, while I would not set aside the sentence on the basis of the sentencing
    judge’s articulation of the standard to be applied to a joint submission,
    I would hold that, in the circumstances, the sentencing judge erred in the
    application of that standard.  He failed to accord sufficient weight to the
    appellant’s guilty plea, including his expression of remorse and importantly,
    the consequence that the complainants were saved the ordeal of testifying
    at trial.  That failure infused his view that the appropriate sentence lay
    well outside the top of the joint submission.  Consequently he erred in rejecting
    the joint submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal as to the custodial portion of the sentence imposed,
    set it aside and impose a global sentence of 10 years less pre&#8209;trial
    custody.  The circumstances require that the sentences imposed with respect
    to the two sets of offences be consecutive.  At the same time, consecutive
    sentences for multiple offences should not exceed the overall culpability
    of the offender.  <i>R. v. M. (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )</i>, <i>supra</i>.  At the time the appellant began assaulting his sisters
    he was a Young Offender and the sentences imposed require me to take into
    account his age and level of development.  As a result I would impose the
    sentences indicated in the chart below:</p>
