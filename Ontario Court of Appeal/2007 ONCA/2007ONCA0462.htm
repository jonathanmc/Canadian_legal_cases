style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Connecticut
    Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut) is the lead plaintiff in a
    class action initiated in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of California (the “District Court”) on behalf of investors who
    acquired securities in JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDS) between October 8,
    1999 and July 26, 2001.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Connecticut
    obtained Letters Rogatory to examine three persons in Ontario by U.S. counsel
    pursuant to U.S. rules.  Two of the three, Tavares and Leduc, subsequently
    consented to examination.  The third person, Gordon Buchan, did not.  Buchan
    is the former in-house counsel of JDS. He held the title of Vice President
    of Business Development and Senior Legal Advisor, and also sat on the executive
    team.  He is not a party to the class action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Connecticut
    successfully applied to enforce the Letter Rogatory against Buchan.  He was
    ordered to attend for examination by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    counsel pursuant to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    rules and to produce the documents specified.  The application judge also
    ordered that JDS be allowed to participate and that such participation include
    the right to object to questions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Buchan
    appeals and seeks to set aside the judgment of the application judge ordering
    him to attend for examination.  He submits that the application judge failed
    to apply the proper legal test for an application to enforce a letter of
    request.  In the alternative, if the examination is to proceed, Buchan seeks
    an amendment to the judgment so as to require that the examination be conducted
    by a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada pursuant to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  He submits
    that it would infringe Canadian sovereignty to permit the deposition of Buchan
    to proceed under the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    California rules of procedure and rules of evidence.  Buchan also argues
    that permitting American attorneys to conduct the deposition is contrary
    to the <i>Law Society Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8.<i> </i>because it constitutes
    the “practice of law”. <i> </i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    intervenor, JDS, takes no position on Buchan’s two substantive grounds of
    appeal.  Should this Court grant Buchan’s alternative relief and amend the
    judgment, JDS asks that this Court specify that JDS’s right to participate,
    including its right to object to questions, also be on the basis of Canadian
    legal principles. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow I would uphold the decision of the application judge
    and dismiss this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>1.         Did the
      application judge apply the proper criteria in considering the application?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    grant an order enforcing the Letter Rogatory, the applicant must satisfy
    the enforcing court that certain criteria are met.  Those criteria, as enumerated
    by this court in <i>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Rybiak</i> (2006), 275
    D.L.R. (4th) 512 at para. 30 (Ont. C.A.), are as follows: a) the evidence
    sought is relevant; b) the evidence sought is necessary for trial and will
    be adduced at trial, if admissible; c) the evidence is not otherwise obtainable;
    d) the order sought is not contrary to public policy; e) the documents sought
    are identified with reasonable specificity; and f) the order sought is not
    unduly burdensome, bearing in mind what the witnesses will be required to
    do, and produce, were the action to be tried.  In addition, the court is
    required to balance two broad considerations in deciding whether to exercise
    its discretion to enforce the Letter Rogatory.  Those considerations are
    the impact on Canadian sovereignty and whether justice requires the taking
    of commission evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    order to appreciate the substance of the appellant’s arguments I have reproduced
    the core of the application judge’s endorsement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The relief requested in this case is for the most
    part an exercise in Judicial discretion governed by <u>Section 60(1) of <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
    the <i>Ontario Evidence Act</i></u>, the section is reproduced at paragraph
    24 of the Applicant’s Factum and forms part of my Reasons.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have considered the written and oral arguments
    of counsel for all parties in this matter and find that an order with specific
    provisions as to the manner, scope and timing of the examination of Mr. Buchan
    is appropriate.  I came to this conclusion by reason of the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)       There is little doubt based upon the Affidavit
    evidence filed that the prospective witness has information that is likely
    relevant to the issues to be tried by the California Court.  Mr. Buchan was
    a Senior Legal Advisor and Vice President with J.D.S. Uniphase Corp.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)       The evidence also supports a finding that
    certain specific information is more likely than not only available through
    his testimony.  The evidence located at paragraphs 5(b) and 5(c) of the Affidavit
    of Michael Stocker is specific to this witness.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)       The general principle of comity of nations
    which suggests that a Canadian court should give full force and effect to
    foreign requests for Judicial assistance, within prescribed limits applies
    in this case.  Furthermore there is no public policy consideration as the
    letters rogatory do not limit or infringe upon Canadian Sovereignty.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)       The arguments raised by the Respondent
    Buchan are for the most part without a basis in evidence and call for speculation
    on the part of the Court.  Furthermore it seems to me that many of the objections
    go to limiting the examination of Mr.&nbsp;Buchan rather than denying the
    relief completely.  The examination will be limited to what is contained
    in paragraph 5 of Michael Stocker’s affidavit which generally speaking is
    what is described in the letters rogatory. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Buchan
    submits that when the application judge wrote in para.&nbsp;(a) of his endorsement
    that he had information “that is <i>likely relevant</i> to the issues to
    be tried”, the application judge applied the wrong test. [Emphasis added.]  The
    evidence must be shown to be <i>relevant</i>, not <i>likely relevant</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    using the phrase “likely relevant” in para.&nbsp;(a), the application judge
    was simply applying the first criterion in <i>Presbyterian Church, supra,</i> relevance,<i> </i>on
    a balance of probabilities.  Paragraph (b) of the application judge’s reasons
    supports this conclusion.  There, the application judge states: “The evidence
    also supports a finding that certain specific information <i>is more likely
    than not </i>only available through [Buchan’s] testimony.”  The application
    judge did not err in applying the first criterion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Buchan
    advances several other arguments in support of his submission that the application
    judge failed to apply the criteria in <i>Presbyterian Church, supra. </i>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    argument he puts forward is that the application judge simply relied on a
    bald statement contained in the affidavit filed in support of the application
    that Buchan’s evidence was relevant and necessary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  Justice Laporte of the District Court ruled that Buchan “has evidence
    relevant to this action”.  The Canadian court does not function as an appellate
    court in respect of the decision of a foreign court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    paragraph (b) of his endorsement the application judge in effect held that
    the criteria of necessity and of the evidence not being otherwise obtainable
    were met.  He referenced the evidence located at paragraphs 5(b) and 5(c)
    of the Affidavit of Michael Stocker and said that that evidence “supports
    a finding that certain specific information is more likely than not available
    only through his testimony” and is “specific to this witness”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    affidavit of Michael Stocker states that during the class period, Buchan
    communicated by email with two of JDS’s senior executives, Straus and Abbe,
    and told them about a $100 million dollar price concession that Lucent demanded.  Within
    a week, when JDS stock price was high, these executives sold $175 million
    dollars worth of JDS stock and the defendants as a group sold $295 million.  The
    affiant deposes </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I believe that Mr. Buchan communicated negative
    financial information directly to the individual defendants and can testify
    both to the falsity of the defendants’ statements [that they did not omit
    to disclose any material facts about JDS ‘financial condition before selling
    their stock] and their knowledge of that falsehood….  He has evidence that
    cannot be otherwise obtained by the plaintiff in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Connecticut…”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>I agree with the application judge that the evidence put forward is not a bald
    statement of necessity but one that is very specific. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    submission is that subsequent depositions taken in this action raise the
    possibility that Buchan’s evidence is no longer necessary and that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Connecticut failed to discharge the onus on it of showing that it was. Following
    the application being made and prior to the application being heard,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Connecticut conducted 25 intervening examinations but the substance of these
    examinations was not disclosed to the court.  As a result, Buchan submits
    that the application judge was unable to make a determination as to whether
    the evidence sought from him was not otherwise obtainable and that the application
    judge could not apply the third criterion in <i>Presbyterian Church, supra.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would disagree that the application judge ought to have been interested in
    whether subsequent depositions by Straus, Abbe and others had resulted in
    the obtention of the evidence sought.  The application rests on the affidavit
    that is filed with the application.  Evidence given under oath is presumed
    to be true. If the affidavit is no longer accurate or there is something
    wrong with that affidavit then there is an evidentiary onus on Buchan to
    bring that forward. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    argument put forward by Buchan is that the application judge reversed the
    burden of proof that lay on
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Connecticut by requiring Buchan to demonstrate that the evidence
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Connecticut sought to elicit from him was otherwise obtainable.  In support
    of this submission, Buchan relies on the application judge’s sentence in
    paragraph (d): “The arguments raised by the Respondent Buchan [to the application]
    are for the most part without a basis in the evidence and call for speculation
    on the part of the Court.”  The application judge was simply responding to
    the argument advanced before him that he ought to take into account the other
    depositions that had been obtained after the application had been filed but
    that had not been produced to the court. It was quite appropriate for him
    to state that he did not wish to engage in speculation as to the content
    of those depositions.  The application judge did not reverse the onus of
    proof.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the tenor of Buchan’s submissions is that the criterion of the “evidence
    being otherwise unavailable” must be interpreted as meaning no evidence on
    the subject in issue is unavailable. I would not interpret this criterion
    so narrowly. Rather, I would read this criterion as meaning that evidence
    of the same value as that sought from the person to be examined cannot otherwise
    be obtained.  In addition, as held by Campbell J. in <i>MAN Aktiengesellschaft
    et al. v. Valentini et al. </i>(2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 680 at para. 28 (S.C.J.): “Where
    fraud is alleged, both confirmation of other information and credibility
    will be important issues.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge did not err in applying the criteria in <i>Presbyterian
    Church, supra.</i>. </p>

    submits that the examination is now an

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    attorney examining a witness is acting as a barrister and solicitor contrary
    to the <i>Law Society Act</i>.  To suggest otherwise, he submits, challenges
    the sovereignty of

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    disagree that Connecticut’s request that U.S. rules and practices be applied
    at the deposition infringes Canada’s sovereignty.  Buchan advances no authority
    in support of his position on this issue.  The action for which the information
    is sought is not an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario action.  The

    of the requesting state should apply to the examination unless the proceedings
    are dealing with fundamental values and the rights of witnesses.  While that
    case was concerned with s. 43 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970,

    seeks costs of the appeal in the amount of $9707.  I disagree that Buchan
    is entitled to any costs on this appeal.  The application judge rejected
    Buchan’s argument and it has even less force here.  I would also hold that
    the respondent, which did not attempt to file its responding factum until
    two days prior to the appeal being heard, is not entitled to costs. In the
    result, each party will bear its own costs of the appeal.</p>
