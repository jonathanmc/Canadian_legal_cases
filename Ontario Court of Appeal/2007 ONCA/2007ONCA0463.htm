  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a trial before judge and jury, the appellant was found guilty on October
    9, 2003 of criminal harassment and invitation to sexual touching.  The jury
    was discharged and his sentencing was adjourned to permit the Crown to bring
    an application to have him declared a dangerous offender.  Subsequently,
    approximately two years later, the question arose whether he was not criminally
    responsible due to mental disorder (“NCRMD”) at the time of the offences.  The
    trial judge determined he had no jurisdiction to determine that question
    and the matter has come before us.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    he was found guilty, the appellant was remanded from time to time to facilitate
    three court ordered assessments.  In the first, dated February 16, 2005,
    Dr. Ramshaw of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health gave the opinion
    that the appellant met or surpassed the threshold for a finding of dangerous
    offender status.  She found his history was consistent with a diagnosis of “Paraphilia
    Not Otherwise specified with sexual coercion, rape fantasies, stalking behaviour,
    and deviant phallometric testing and more recently a more covert gravitation
    toward younger females, complicated by psychopathy.”  Dr. Ramshaw did not
    address whether he was NCRMD.  Dr. Ramshaw did note she could not rule out
    a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified though “the psychotic like experiences
    and behaviour of the appellant could be a consequence of his severe personality
    structure with perceived injustices and a righteous stance.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second report, dated December 12, 2005, was by Dr. Federoff of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital.  He expressed the opinion that the appellant was NCRMD at the time
    of the offences because he suffers from a delusional disorder, mixed type.  He
    suggested that he could be treated with antipsychotic medication and could
    be managed in a medium secure treatment facility.  The appellant agreed to
    begin treatment with the antipsychotic medication, olanzapine.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the request of the Crown, the court ordered another assessment by Dr. Woodside
    also of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health.  His report dated March
    20, 2006, set out Dr. Woodside’s belief that the appellant would have been
    able to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts and omissions at the
    time of the offences, though Dr. Woodside cautioned he could not rule out
    the possibility that the appellant did have a defence of NCRMD available
    to him.  Dr. Woodside’s opinion was based largely on a review of the file
    materials as the appellant declined to participate in his assessment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was then unrepresented and an <i>amicus curiae</i> was appointed.  The
    appellant brought an application before the trial judge on June 7, 2006 asking
    the trial judge to make the finding that the appellant was NCR.  The <i>amicus
    curiae’s</i> position was that, though the jury had been discharged, the
    trial judge retained jurisdiction to enter an NCR verdict in order to avoid
    an infringement of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  The Crown’s position
    was that, though “all parties are agreeable to a finding of Not Criminally
    Responsible” such finding could only be made by the Court of Appeal as the
    trial judge’s remaining jurisdiction was limited to sentencing the appellant
    because the jury had been discharged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the trial judge’s ruling on June 14, 2006, he recognized that the conviction
    of a person who is not criminally responsible at the time of the offence
    would violate the <i>Charter</i>.  However, he noted that it had not yet
    been proved that the appellant was NCRMD.  He concluded he had no jurisdiction
    to consider whether the appellant was NCRMD some three years after the convictions
    had been registered and the jury discharged.  He pointed out that s. 686(1)
    (d) of the<i> Criminal Code </i>permits an accused to appeal against a conviction,
    and the Court of Appeal may set aside the conviction and find the appellant
    NCRMD.  Consequently, he dismissed the application and ruled that the sentencing
    of the appellant would proceed absent a substituted verdict or an order for
    new trial by the Court of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appealed to this court.  The Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario
    (“CLA”) intervened in the appeal to argue that the trial judge had jurisdiction
    to address the question whether the appellant was NCRMD after the jury had
    been dismissed.  On the appeal, the Crown resiled from the position it took
    before the trial judge and argued that the evidence did not establish that
    the appellant was NCR.  The Crown maintained its position that, after the
    jury was dismissed, the trial judge no longer had jurisdiction to consider
    whether the appellant was NCRMD.</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    no conviction is apparent on the record, the failure of the trial judge to
    formally enter convictions is a mere oversight.  It is obvious he intended
    to register convictions, and on the application he proceeded on the basis
    that he had done so.  We, too, proceed on that basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant tendered a substantial amount of fresh evidence, consisting of
    the doctors’ reports, their cross examinations and related material.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that the fresh evidence meets the first three of the four
    requirements of the test in <i>Palmer v.  The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    759.  However, the Crown submits that the fresh evidence, if believed and
    taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, could not reasonably be expected
    to have affected the result.  The Crown submits we should find that the fresh
    evidence does not establish that the appellant is NCRMD.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Federoff’s opinion that the appellant is suffering from a delusional disorder
    that would support a defence of NCRMD is based on an in-hospital evaluation
    conducted at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital from September 3, 2005 to November 5, 2005.  The evaluation was
    a comprehensive assessment with which the appellant cooperated fully.  He
    was examined by a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals including
    psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.  The assessment included
    biological laboratory testing, a neuropsychological consult, a sleep deprived
    EEG analysis, an MRI of the appellant’s brain and a full Sexual Behaviour
    Clinic assessment, and phallometric and actuarial tests.  It is cogent and
    deserving of weight.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that Dr. Federoff did not adequately consider the appellant’s
    behaviour in committing the offences.  This behaviour the Crown submits provides
    reason to doubt Dr. Federoff’s opinion and prefer that of Dr. Woodside.  However,
    the appellant declined to participate in the assessment by Dr. Woodside.  Dr.
    Woodside did not himself examine the appellant, did not appreciate he was
    on antipsychotic medication, and indicated he could not rule out the possibility
    of the appellant being NCRMD.  Nevertheless, he makes some cogent observations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the fresh evidence could reasonably be expected to have affected
    the result had it been introduced before the jury.
     Moreover, a trial judge is much better positioned to decide the question
    as the doctors could be called to explain their opinions. Consequently I
    would order a new trial.</p>
