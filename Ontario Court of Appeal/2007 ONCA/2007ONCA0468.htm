    is an appeal from an order of the
    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, which allowed an appeal from an interlocutory order by
    a motion judge. The

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court's decision required the plaintiff-appellant, Sara Earley-Kendall,
    to attend two defence medical examinations, relief which the motion judge
    had refused. For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4>THE FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 13, 2002, the appellant-plaintiff, Sara Earley-Kendall, (“the plaintiff”)
    was injured in a motor vehicle collision between the car she was operating
    and the defendant’s car. Her co-plaintiff’s claim is derivative in nature
    pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this appeal, the procedural history of the within action is significant and
    highly relevant to my disposition of this case. Therefore, I will review
    this history in some detail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial record in this case was filed in December 2004 and the case was called
    for
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Assignment Court on February 18, 2005. However, the defence – who had inadvertently
    misplaced the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Assignment Court list faxed to their office on February 15, 2005 – did not
    become aware of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Assignment Court date until February 18, 2005, presumably sometime after
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Assignment Court had been held. At that time an “assistant”
    in the office of defence counsel telephoned plaintiffs’ counsel and was informed
    that a representative of that office had attended the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Assignment Court earlier that day and obtained a pretrial date for June 10,
    2005 and a trial date for October 17, 2005. These dates had not been canvassed
    with counsel for the defence before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Assignment Court. However, plaintiffs’ counsel confirmed the dates obtained
    in correspondence to defence counsel dated February 25, 2005, and no objection
    was taken with respect to the dates at that time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early March 2005, the parties agreed to a private mediation, which proceeded
    as scheduled on April 25, 2005. Thereafter the pre-trial proceeded as scheduled
    on June 10, 2005. No concerns were raised by the defence at either of these
    events about the date or timing of the scheduled trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs served on the defence an expert medical report and a follow-up
    report from Dr. Delaney on February 13, 2004 and April 12, 2005, respectively.
    Both reports were served prior to the mediation and pretrial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would appear that the defence did not raise the subject of having a defence
    medical examination of the plaintiff until a letter to plaintiffs’ counsel
    dated July 19, 2005, which letter is not in the record before this court.
    Counsel for the plaintiff responded by correspondence dated July 22, 2005
    stating:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… I have received instructions from my clients to
    oppose any motion that you may bring with respect to a request for an adjournment
    of the October 17, 2005 trial date. My clients want this trial to go ahead
    as scheduled.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You have had ample time to conduct defence medicals
    as you have been involved in this file since September of 2003. Furthermore,
    our expert report of Dr. Delaney was served on you on February 13, 2004 as
    well as a follow-up report of hers which was served on April 12, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Fraser, an associate with the plaintiffs’
    law firm, swore an affidavit on October 4, 2005 stating that the defence
    did nothing further in relation to conducting defence medical examinations
    until the defence brought a motion returnable August 30, 2005 – less than
    two months before trial – requesting that the trial in this matter be adjourned
    in order to permit the defence to conduct defence medical examinations (“the
    first defence motion”). The first defence motion was heard by Little J. on
    September 6, 2005 and was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    endorsement of the court reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is no substantial reason given for the adjournment.
    The request for defence medicals is late and apparently not necessary to
    continue settlement talks. I see no prejudice to the defence to proceed.
    Steps were taken too late to object about the trial date being fixed without
    consent of defence counsel. Motion dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence sought leave to appeal the order of Little J. before Browne J. on
    September 21, 2005. That motion was also dismissed. The court’s endorsement
    reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not find the issues raised go beyond the interest
    of the parties and there is not such importance that in my opinion leave
    should be granted.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The motion judge exercised discretion. The endorsement
    indicates the discretion was judicially exercised and entitled to deference.
    I do not doubt the correctness of the order made. Leave to appeal refused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next step in these proceedings was a letter dated September 28, 2005 from
    defence counsel to plaintiffs’ counsel reading, in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have now arranged two defence medicals for your
    client to take place prior to the trial currently scheduled for October 17<sup>th</sup>.
    I have cancelled the two other examinations which were set for November 1<sup>st</sup> with
    Dr. Cividino and January 18<sup>th</sup> with Dr. Upton. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The two appointments currently scheduled are with
    Dr. Frank Lipson, a rheumatologist and Dr. Geoffrey French, an orthopaedic
    surgeon.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have been assured that I will have reports from
    both doctors before the start of trial and will supply them to you immediately
    on receipt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Plaintiffs’ counsel
    responded by letter dated September 29, 2005 stating in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please be advised that my client is not going to
    be attending these medicals as you are out of time in regards to same.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You brought your motion unsuccessfully to adjourn
    the trial and appealed same again unsuccessfully. The Judge specifically
    commented on there not being any prejudice to proceed with this matter because
    you had not done medicals and that essentially you were out of time.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I also note that you are making efforts to have
    my client see an orthopaedic surgeon and a rheumatologist neither of which
    were doctors seen by my client.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You know full well that should such reports be provided
    to me at the doorstep of the trial, I would not be in a position to proceed
    with the trial of this matter as I would have to get responding reports and
    may in fact have to send my clients to see a doctor as she is not seeing
    a doctor within those particular disciplines.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It appears that this is simply an attempt to get
    through the back door what you could not get through the front door and I
    will not agree to have my clients attend.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    letter dated October 3, 2005, Mr. Rosenkrantz, on behalf of the defence,  responded,
    in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am unaware of any Rule, Statute or case law which
    permits your client to escape attending defence medicals as arranged.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You may rightly object to my ability to file the
    report or call the doctor to testify at trial given what will obviously be
    late service of the report.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I will therefore expect your client to be in attendance
    as scheduled [.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Plaintiffs’ counsel
    responded that his client would not attend the defence medical appointments
    scheduled and that a motion would be necessary to compel her attendance.
    The same day defence counsel served a Notice of Motion returnable the following
    day, October 5, 2005 (“the second defence motion”). The relief sought included
    orders compelling the plaintiff to attend the defence medical examinations
    scheduled with Drs. Lipson and French.</p>

    support of the second defence motion Ms. Pool
    – an associate with the defendant’s law firm – filed an affidavit dated October
    4, 2005. It is of note that in her affidavit Ms. Pool omitted any reference
    to the interaction between plaintiffs’ counsel and defence counsel beginning
    with defence counsel’s letter to plaintiff’s counsel dated July 19, 2005
    and ending with the order of Browne J. dated September 21, 2005 refusing
    the defence request for leave to appeal the order of Little J. with respect
    to the first defence motion. That necessary history was supplied to the court
    in Ms. Fraser’s responding affidavit, referenced above.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second defence motion was heard by Rady J. on October 5, 2005. The motion
    judge dismissed the motion. She stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… an adjournment request has already been entertained
    by the court and turned down. One of the reasons for the adjournment request
    was to permit defence medical examinations. I view this motion as very much
    the same thing although dressed up a little bit differently.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The defence has recently been able to arrange medical
    examinations now on an expedited basis, but there is no explanation as to
    why that could not have been done at some earlier stage. In my view, the
    defence has had ample time to arrange and conduct defence examinations. Any
    reports that would be generated, if I were inclined to grant the relief sought,
    would clearly run afoul of Rule 53. Those reports, in my view, would have
    the potential to derail the trial scheduled for October 17, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendant next moved for leave to appeal the interlocutory discretionary
    order of Rady J. From the record it appears that this motion for leave to
    appeal originally came on before Leitch R.S.J. on October 20, 2005, but,
    seemingly because the transcripts from the second defence motion were not
    yet available, she postponed the hearing of the motion to October 24, 2005. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Meanwhile,
    the trial in this matter had begun on October 17, 2005 with the selection
    of a jury but the calling of evidence was postponed to await the call of
    the trial co-ordinator.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    Saturday, October 22, 2004 Ms. Pool emailed plaintiffs’ counsel, Mr. Murray,
    and requested an adjournment of the motion for leave to appeal scheduled
    to be heard that coming Monday the 24<sup>th</sup>  to permit her time to
    deliver materials.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Murray refused to consent to any adjournment. He said that the motion should
    proceed, that defence counsel could bring the materials to court on Monday
    the 24<sup>th</sup>, and that he, plaintiffs’

    Rosenkrantz on the other hand says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I mistakenly understood that [Mr. Murray] would
    be attending Monday morning which was the return date after the motion had
    been adjourned at least once. I had mistakenly understood that he would appear
    in front of whomever the judge was and consent to an adjournment to today
    to hear that motion.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>… </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Let me go back to what I said at the beginning.
    On Monday morning, I come into the office and am apprised of all of this
    including the email saying [that Mr. Murray does not want to adjourn the
    motion]. I phone Mr. Murray. I say this is crazy. I can’t get the material
    into a factum. I can’t prepare my factum without the endorsement. The last
    time we attended the motion in front of Justice Rady Mr. Gilby served me
    with his responding materials at 5:00 p.m. the day before. I didn’t even
    know there were any materials until the end of the motion in front of Justice
    Rady. I said I don’t wish to be caught in the same situation that you are
    going to hand me materials ten seconds before the motion begins. I thought
    that Mr. Murray agreed with me and was consenting to adjourning the motion
    one day. At that point, we didn’t know this trial was going to start today
    and that is the mistake that I made. I thought we were having a consent adjournment. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I obviously totally misunderstood what Mr. Murray
    and I discussed on the phone because he has indicated that’s not what he
    understood our conversation to be. I accept that [.] …</p>

    is significant that both lawyers’ versions of the disputed telephone conversation  were

    the submissions of counsel.</p>

    trial judge, Jenkins J., accepted the defence’s contention that its failure
    to appear on the Monday motion had been due to an accident or mistake. Consequently,
    he set aside Kennedy J.’s order denying leave to appeal pursuant to Rule
    37.14.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then dealt with the merits of the defence motion for leave to
    appeal the decision of Rady J. He held that the defendant had not “been able
    to obtain a defence medical prior to the case being reached for trial in
    spite of reasonable efforts on the part of his counsel.”  Therefore, “it
    would be unjust and prejudicial to the defendant to force him to go to trial
    without a defence medical”. Further, there would be “no significant prejudice
    to the plaintiff by a delay in this matter”. Accordingly, the trial judge
    granted leave to appeal the order of Rady J.</p>

  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, at the heart of this appeal is the question of whether the motion
    before  Rady J. on October 5, 2005 was, in substance, the same motion previously
    brought before Little J. on September 6, 2005. Stated another way, was the
    first defence motion substantially the same as the second defence motion?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the answer to that question is “yes” then, in my view, the motion before
    Rady J. was improper in that the substance of that motion had been finally
    and conclusively determined by the order of Browne J. made September 21,
    2005 when he denied leave to appeal the order of Little J.</p>
  <h4>SUBSTANCE OF THE DEFENCE MOTIONS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from the endorsement of Little J. that the motion before him sought
    an adjournment of the trial to permit defence medical examinations which
    had been scheduled for November 2005 and January 2006 – both after the date
    on which the trial had been fixed to commence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion before Rady J. sought an order compelling the plaintiff to attend
    defence medical examinations now arranged for October 6 and October 11, 2006 – both
    dates before commencement of trial. The expert physicians conducting those
    examinations had promised that their reports would be delivered before trial.
    The only difference was the timing of the appointments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset of her reasons, Rady J. noted that an adjournment request had
    already been entertained by the court and refused. I agree with her observation
    that the motion before her was “very much the same thing although dressed
    up a little bit differently”. I also agree with the plaintiffs’ position
    that the motion before Rady J. was an attempt to get through the back door
    what the defence was unable to get through the front door.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, there is no substantial difference between requesting the adjournment
    of a trial where the basis of that request is to permit the defence to conduct
    pre-arranged defence medical examinations of the plaintiff and a subsequent
    motion to compel the same plaintiff in the same proceeding to attend such
    examinations (albeit at different times) where the trial would most likely
    be necessarily adjourned as a result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ultimate issue was the timeliness of the defence request for medical examination
    of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    effort was made for such medical examination until mid-July, 2005. When that
    request was promptly denied by plaintiffs’
    counsel it was incumbent on the defence to immediately seek an order pursuant
    to s. 105 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43. The
    trial was scheduled to proceed on October 17, 2005 and so the defence would
    have needed to serve any responding report on the plaintiffs no later than
    August 17, 2005. In this case, however, the defence did nothing until its
    motion returnable August 30, 2005 and heard by Little J. on September 6,
    2005.</p>
  <h4>ISSUE ESTOPPEL</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, once the motion for leave to appeal the order of Little J. was dismissed
    on September 21, 2005, the defence was thereafter precluded from seeking
    the relief under s.105 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, <i>supra</i> give
    that the issue had been finally determined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Ward
      v. Dana G. Colson Management Ltd.</i> (1994), 24 C.P.C. (3d) 211 (Gen.
      Div.) at 218, aff’d . [1994] O.J. No. 2792 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) E. Macdonald J. noted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A decision in an interlocutory application is binding
    on the parties, at least with respect to other proceedings in the same action.
    I agree with the submission that the general principle is that it is not
    open for the court, in a case of the same question arising between the same
    parties, to review a previous decision not open to appeal. If the decision
    was wrong, it ought to have been appealed within the appropriate time frames.
    This principle is not affected by the fact that the first decision was pronounced
    in the course of the same action. See <i>Diamond v. Western Realty Co.</i>,
    [1924] S.C.R. 308.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Counsel for the plaintiff] cites <i>Fidelitas Shipping
      Co. v. V/O Exportchleb</i>, [1966] 1 Q.B. 630 (C.A.) (hereinafter “<i>Fidelitas</i>”)
      in support of the proposition that, once an issue has been raised and determined
      between the parties, then, as a general rule, neither party can be allowed
      to fight that issue all over again in the same or subsequent proceedings.
      I refer, in particular, to Lord Denning’s comments which appear at p. 640
      of the judgment in <i>Fidelitas</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>The law, as I understand it, is this: if one
    party brings an action against another for a particular cause and judgment
    is given upon it, there is a strict rule of law that he cannot bring another
    action against the same party for the same cause. Transit in rem judicatam<i>:  </i>see <i>King
    v. Hoare</i>, [(1844), 13 M. &amp;
    W. 494, 504]. But within one cause of action, there may be several issues
    raised which are necessary for the determination of the whole case. The rule
    then is that, once an issue has been raised and distinctly determined between
    the parties then, as a general rule, neither party can be allowed to fight
    that issue all over again. The same issue cannot be raised by either of them
    again in the same or subsequent proceedings except in special circumstances,
    see <i>Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin</i>, [(1909) A.C. 615], <i>per</i> Lord
    Macnaghten. And within one issue, there may be several points available which
    go to aid one party or the other in his efforts to secure a determination
    of the issue in his favour. The rule then is that each party must use reasonable
    diligence to bring forward every point which he thinks would help him. If
    he omits to raise any particular point, from negligence, inadvertence, or
    even accident (<i>which would or might have decided the issue in his favour</i>),
    he may find himself shut out from raising that point again, at any rate in
    any case where the self same issue arises in the same or subsequent proceedings.
    But this again is not an inflexible rule. It can be departed from in special
    circumstances. (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>And at page 219 she continued:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, the courts should depart from the principles
    expressed by Lords Denning and Diplock in extremely rare circumstances. The
    reasons for this are obvious. A party to a proceeding, if granted a second
    chance to raise what was already before the court, undermines the integrity
    of the rules which guide the conduct of litigation. There has to be certainty
    and finality of the disposition of matters by the courts. Otherwise, the
    results would be chaotic.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    as Laskin J.A., on behalf of this court, observed in <i>Minott v. O’Shanter
    Development Co.</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 at 329:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Res judicata</i> itself is a form of estoppel
    and embraces both cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. Cause of action
    estoppel prevents a party from relitigating a claim that was decided or <i>could
    have been raised in an earlier proceeding</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Were
    it otherwise, a party who was unsuccessful the first time and where there
    has been no change in circumstance, could bring the same motion before any
    number of judges in an effort to find one who would grant the relief sought.
    Such multiplicity of proceedings is to be discouraged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    a trial judge enjoys an overarching discretion to consider a motion for an
    adjournment of a trial, that discretion must be exercised judiciously and
    in accordance with the law. It is not open to a trial judge to grant an adjournment
    on the basis of the same facts put to another judge of concurrent jurisdiction
    earlier in the proceedings in the absence of a change of circumstance, where
    the first judge refused the adjournment request. To do otherwise would fly
    in the face of the well-settled law of issue estoppel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I noted above, the first and second defence motions were substantially the
    same. In my view, therefore, the issue raised before Rady J. and thereafter
    in related leave applications before Kennedy J. and Jenkins J. was finally
    determined by the order of Browne J. on September 21, 2005. At that point
    in time the defence was estopped from raising the issue again. For this reason
    I conclude that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred when it granted the defendant’s motion to compel the
    plaintiff to attend a defence medical. Further, in my view, Rady J. correctly
    declined to exercise her discretion to grant the defendant the relief he
    sought.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the facts of this case it is clear that the only difference between the motion
    heard by Little J. and that heard by Rady J. was in the timing of the defence
    medical examinations. Those examinations were originally scheduled after
    the set trial date (the motion before Little J.) and subsequently before
    the set trial date (the motion before Rady J.). The defence could, and more
    importantly should, have raised all matters of relevance in relation to the
    timing of the defence medical examinations when he was before Little J. on
    September 6, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    coming to this conclusion, I am aware that, from the factums filed at the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, it would appear that the argument of issue estoppel was
    not argued before that court or before Jenkins J. other than indirectly.
    Instead, the argument there was more focused on the merits of the decision
    of Rady J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in these particular circumstances, where the appellant has argued that this
    issue had “earlier been determined”
    and that the defendant was “attempting to get through the back door what
    he couldn’t get through the front” it is nonetheless appropriate that this
    court deal with the issue estoppel argument which is before this court. I
    say this for two reasons: one, there is a full record before this court in
    relation to the issue; and two, the issue raised is one of law and the respondent
    has had a full opportunity to address the issue both in its factum and in
    oral argument.</p>
