    charges against the appellant arise out of a home invasion by three men,
    during which Jacqueline Glassford (“Mrs. Glassford”) and her seventeen-year-old
    son, Justin, were confined, their house ransacked, and their property stolen.
    At trial, the fact of the home invasion, theft and use of the firearm in
    the course of the invasion, were not disputed. The sole issue was the identification
    of the appellant as one of the robbers.</p>

      her home had come to the house earlier that evening, and her son had spoken
      to them at the backdoor of the house. Thereafter, the three men left. </span></p>

      brandished a gun and Justin was taken down to the basement of the house.
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Glassford, who could hear scuffling in the kitchen, attempted
      to call 911. She was not sure if she had succeeded before one of the three
      men came suddenly toward her with a gun and told her to hand over the phone,
      which she did. Mrs. Glassford was led at gun-point to the basement where
      she found her son and the other two men.</span></p>

      Mrs. Glassford and Justin were being held in the basement, Mrs. Glassford,
      who was worried that her youngest son would return home during the invasion
      and in the confusion be shot,  stood up and got “in the face” of M.L.T.
      M.L.T. threatened to tie her down, and produced two black straps from his
      knapsack to demonstrate the seriousness of his threat. According to Justin,
      M.L.T. threatened to pull a gun, which he demonstrated that he had in his
      bag, and shoot him in the head if Mrs. Glassford did not stop. </span></p>

      come out. Thereafter, Mrs. Glassford heard the three men leave the house.</span></p>

    question, the facts to which M.L.T. admitted were at odds with his evidence
    at the appellant’s trial. However the trial judge at the appellant’s trial
    expressly considered M.L.T.’s evidence on the basis that he was trying to
    minimize his involvement. In my view, therefore, there is no basis on which
    to suggest that the events surrounding M.L.T.’s guilty plea in any way undermined
    the trial judge’s analysis. These later events simply affirmed the trial

    the firm where trial counsel was employed at the time of the appellant’s

    the completion of the Crown’s evidence, trial counsel testified that he again
    spoke to the appellant about testifying. At that time, trial counsel had
    decided that the appellant should not testify. He spoke to the appellant
    about his position and the appellant acceded to it. However, trial counsel
    says that he never told the appellant that he could not testify or that whether
    the appellant would testify was counsel’s decision, not the appellant’s.
    Rather, trial counsel urged the appellant not to testify and the appellant
    agreed. </p>

    test for ineffective assistance of counsel is set out in this court’s decision
    in <i>R. v. Archer</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 at 96 where Doherty J.A.
    summarized the applicable legal principles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>An accused who
    is represented at trial is entitled to effective representation by counsel.
    Ineffective representation may result in a miscarriage of justice necessitating
    the quashing of the conviction on appeal. Evidence relating to the alleged
    ineffective assistance of counsel will be received on appeal pursuant to
    s. 683(1) so that the appellate court may determine whether the representation
    was ineffective and ultimately whether it resulted in a miscarriage of justice[.]
    [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>An appellant
    seeking to quash a conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel
    must demonstrate three things. First, where the claim is based on contested
    facts, the appellant must establish the material facts on the balance of
    probabilities. Second, the appellant must demonstrate that counsel’s acts
    or omissions amounted to incom
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    petence. Incom
    <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">
    petence is measured against a reasonableness standard. That assessment is
    made having regard to the circumstances as they existed when the impugned
    acts or omissions occurred. Hindsight plays no role in the assessment. Allegations
    of incom
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    petent representation must be closely scrutinized. Many decisions made by
    counsel at trial will come to be seen as erroneous in the cold light of a
    conviction. The reasonableness analysis must proceed upon a “strong presumption
    that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional
    assistance”[.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Third, the appellant
    must demonstrate that counsel’s ineffective representation caused a miscarriage
    of justice. A miscarriage of justice occurs if the appellate court is satisfied
    that counsel’s ineffective representation undermined the appearance of the
    fairness of the trial, or the reliability of the verdict. A verdict is rendered
    unreliable where the appellant demonstrates that had counsel performed in
    a com
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    petent fashion, there is a reasonable possibility that the verdict could
    have been different[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    recap: the appellant’s central ground of appeal is that, contrary to his
    wishes, trial counsel refused to permit him to testify in his own defence.
    Further, the appellant alleges that trial counsel told him that the decision
    of whether to testify was one for trial counsel, not the appellant, and that
    he (trial counsel) had decided that the appellant would not testify. The
    appellant argues that he did not realize that he had a right to testify,
    even if his lawyer did not want to call him as a witness. He asserts that
    he would have testified if he had known that the decision was his to make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel maintains that he advised the appellant against testifying in the
    strongest terms, but made it clear to him that this decision was his to make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law is clear:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If the appellant
    can show that it was trial counsel and not the appellant who decided that
    the appellant would not testify, and that the appellant would have testified
    had he understood that it was his decision, it seems to me that it must be
    accepted that his testimony could have affected the result, thereby establishing
    that a miscarriage of justice occurred … The crucial question becomes – who
    made the decision?  (<i>Archer</i>, <i>supra</i> at 102.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    must, however, consider that the appellant has a very strong motive to fabricate
    the claim that he was denied the right to decide whether to testify. As this
    court noted in <i>Archer</i> at p. 102:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellant
    is no longer presumed innocent. He makes his allegation against trial counsel
    as a convicted felon facing a lengthy penitentiary term. No doubt, the appellant
    understands that if he can convince the court that his own lawyer denied
    him the opportunity to testify, he will receive a new trial. Common sense
    dictates a cautious approach to allegations against trial lawyers made by
    convicted persons who are seeking to avoid lengthy jail terms. It must also
    be recognized that the confidential nature of the relationship between a
    lawyer and his client can make it easy for the client to make all kinds of
    unfounded allegations against his former lawyer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Furthermore,
    and apart entirely from the possibility that the appellant has fabricated
    these allegations, it is not uncommon that a person who has been convicted
    after having received strong advice from his counsel that he should not testify
    comes to believe, while awaiting his appeal, that counsel’s strong advice
    was in fact a decision by counsel that the client should not testify. Looking
    backwards through the bars of a jail cell is not the most reliable of vantage
    points from which to see events that culminated in the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the appellant’s claims against his trial counsel can be believed on a balance
    of probabilities is, in effect, an assessment of credibility. An appellate
    court is not in a good position to conduct such an exercise. However, the
    following factors are significant. First, the appellant is not a newcomer
    to the criminal justice system. He has testified before in a number of other,
    unrelated, criminal proceedings. His record is relevant to the assessment
    of his credibility. Second, the appellant was told by one of the senior members
    that he could testify in this matter. Third, his first Notice of Appeal in
    this case, which he dictated to another inmate at the Don Jail after his
    conviction but before sentencing, does not refer to the conduct of trial
    counsel although the appellant claims that it was at the Don Jail that he
    learned that trial counsel’s alleged failure to call him as a witness when
    he wanted to testify was a ground of appeal. Finally, trial counsel continued
    to represent the appellant when he was sentenced some four months after his
    conviction. This despite the fact that, according to the appellant, he had
    complained, both to trial counsel directly and to the senior member who had
    handled his file previously, about trial counsel’s failure to follow his
    instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
    trial counsel’s evidence is not without its own difficulties. First, although
    the trial did not begin until May 11, 2004, trial counsel’s affidavit, docket
    entries and account to Legal Aid all state that the trial commenced one day
    earlier, on May 10, 2004. In fact, trial counsel was ill on May 10, 2004
    and did not show up in court at all on that date. Second, trial counsel attested
    that he only became aware of the identity of the trial judge on the day that
    the trial actually commenced, and that he learned that fact from the trial
    co-ordinator. In fact, the record is strongly persuasive that Crown counsel
    informed trial counsel on May 10, 2004 (the day trial counsel was absent)
    of the identity of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    these difficulties, in my view, the appellant has failed to satisfy the burden
    that rests on him to make out his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
    Clearly his claim in relation to this ground is based on contested facts.
    The appellant is not a credible witness and has not established – as he must – the
    material facts on a balance of probabilities, nor has he demonstrated that
    trial counsel’s acts or omissions amounted to incom
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    petence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant always asserted his innocence, he had no alibi evidence and
    trial counsel was of the view that he would not make a good witness. Further,
    trial counsel claims that he had reason to believe that the appellant had
    information about the Glassford residence that he could only have obtained
    if he had been in that residence. Trial counsel also states that the appellant’s
    explanation for why M.L.T. would falsely accuse the appellant was farfetched
    and incredible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    charges against him arose out of a home invasion in July 2003. The main issue
    at trial was identification. That is, was he one of the perpetrators?  The
    appellant has always maintained that he was not present at and therefore
    not a participant in the crime. He says that his counsel prevented him from
    testifying in his own defence despite his desire to do so. In other words,
    he says the decision that he not testify was that of the lawyer, not the

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>14. Following
    the completion of the Crown’s evidence, I again spoke to Mr. McKenzie about

    in his affidavit and on cross-examination, trial counsel gave evidence that
    the first day of the appellant’s trial was Monday, May 10, 2004. He described
    in precise detail arriving at the courthouse, discovering from the trial
    co-ordinator who the trial judge would be, making cell phone calls to other
    lawyers in his office about the trial judge, discussing re-election with
    the appellant and commencing the trial. When it was suggested to him that
    he was not at the courthouse that day, his response was that he believed
    he was there, that he was ill one day, but as far as he could recall, it
    was not the first day of trial. Then, when confronted with the transcript
    showing clearly that he was ill and not in attendance that day, he had to
    acknowledge that while he did not think it was the first day, that he was
    ill, apparently it was and, to that extent, his affidavit was incorrect.
    Rather, he said that the events he testified to occurred on May 11.</p>

    firm to Legal Aid
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    acknowledged that his usual practice was to input his own dockets except
    for a short period of time when he provided his handwritten dockets to a
    staff member who entered them and which he then checked. When confronted
    with the account and his own dockets, he was forced to agree that he billed
    for 10.25 hours on May 10, 2004 that never took place. He then immediately
    suggested that the whole account was simply off by one day until he was forced
    to acknowledge that he had also put in full dockets for May 11, 12 and 13
    when the trial took place, and May 14 when judgment was delivered. While
    on re-examination he denied that he intended to bill for time that he did
    not put in, there is no doubt that his dockets were wrong and the Legal Aid
    account was in error.</p>

    he added that he learned this from the trial co-ordinator. After being confronted
    with the discrepancy about dates, he said that all this happened on May 11.
    However, in the transcript for May 10, Crown counsel put on the record that
    she had received a message at 9:10 a.m. that trial counsel was ill and would
    not be attending. She then discussed with Justice LaForme his concerns that
    the trial be completed in one week which was all he had available. Justice
    LaForme offered the suggestion that this timeframe could certainly be met
    with a re-election. Crown counsel indicated that she wanted to discuss this
    with trial counsel and, after a break, returned to say that she had done
    so. She said this:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I expressed your
    concerns about being finished this week, and he assures me it should be done
    by Friday. We have had brief discussions, but he is quite confident that
    we can finish by Friday.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    confronted with this transcript in cross-examination, trial counsel first
    said that he did not recall the conversation. He then said that Crown counsel
    may have said she was concerned about being finished that week, but he was
    adamant that there was no conversation on May 10 about who the trial judge
    was. I find that difficult to accept. Crown counsel was relaying the concerns
    of Justice LaForme about timing. The judge had suggested re-election as a
    possible solution. Given the invariable interest of defence counsel in knowing
    who the trial judge will be, and in the context of this specific discussion,
    I think it is unlikely that trial counsel would not have learned the identity
    of the trial judge in the phone conversation with Crown counsel on May 10.
    I cannot accept trial counsel’s evidence about when and how he first learned
    who the trial judge was.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    and most importantly, I also cannot accept trial counsel’s evidence about
    the circumstances in which he says the appellant agreed not to give evidence
    pursuant to his recommendation. His main affidavit was unequivocal: his own
    recommendation could not be finalized until the Crown completed its evidence,
    but once that occurred, he decided that the appellant should not testify
    and the appellant acceded to this position. In cross-examination, he was
    even clearer that his final position could not be reached until the Crown’s
    case was in, and that the discussion in which the position was put to the
    appellant and the latter’s agreement given took place in the interview room
    beside the cells in the basement of the courthouse after the close of the
    Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    was then shown the transcript indicating that, after lunch on May 12, he
    completed his cross-examination of the alleged accomplice, clearly an important
    witness. The Crown then called its last witness, Detective Reid, who also
    had important evidence to give about the identification of the appellant.
    When trial counsel concluded his cross-examination, the Crown closed its
    case. The transcript then shows trial counsel immediately indicating to the
    court that he was not calling any evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    confronted with this, trial counsel’s story changed. He said that, at the
    close of the Crown’s case, he simply went to the appellant in the box and
    confirmed to him that he was not going to testify. Trial counsel said that
    he had told the appellant in the morning that he would have to testify in
    a narrative manner and, if he did so, everyone would think that he was guilty
    and that he ought not to do so. In this version, trial counsel felt no need
    to await the close of the Crown’s case before taking his final position,
    nor was there any discussion or explanation offered to the appellant later
    at the close of the Crown’s case. Nor was there any meeting with the appellant
    at that point in the basement of the courthouse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    trial counsel was now suggesting that the most important meeting took place
    that morning. However, he had previously agreed in cross-examination that
    his dockets for May 12 showed no morning meeting with the appellant in the
    cells, explaining, “I probably went down five, ten minutes and said, you
    know, this is what I expect to happen today, <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>.”  In
    short, I cannot accept trial counsel’s affidavit describing the appellant’s
    acceptance of his recommendation. Nor do I find the new version on cross-examination
    any more believable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    in his main affidavit, trial counsel was not explicit about his reason for
    concluding that the appellant should not testify. The clear inference is
    that an important consideration for him was that Mr. Royle, who had acted
    for the appellant before, felt the appellant would do poorly as a witness.
    Mr. Royle denied holding this view of the appellant or saying so to trial
    counsel. In fact, Mr. Royle had called the appellant in his own defence on
    a prior occasion and, while the appellant had not been the best imaginable
    witness, he had done well enough and indeed was acquitted. Trial counsel
    maintained his position in the first part of his cross-examination and reiterated
    that he did not reach any firm conclusion until after the Crown had completed
    its case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    as part of the changed version about the final decision not to testify, trial
    counsel volunteered that he had concluded on the basis of certain specific
    things the appellant had told him that, to avoid suborning perjury, the appellant
    could testify only if trial counsel asked him no questions, which would be
    fatal. While he had made no mention of this in his affidavit or in his cross-examination
    to that point, he said that he had alluded to it in an earlier letter to
    appellant’s counsel. That earlier allusion said simply, “I indicated that
    based on some of what the client had said, I was unable to call him.”  In
    his reply affidavit, the appellant categorically denied knowing those things
    or telling trial counsel of them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    sequence presents a number of problems. If trial counsel felt that, because
    of what the appellant had told him, he could not call the appellant, his
    final conclusion did not need to await the close of the Crown’s case and
    his earlier evidence to that effect was incorrect. If trial counsel felt
    he could call the appellant but not ask him any questions and that he therefore
    ought not to testify, and trial counsel had in fact communicated that to
    the appellant that morning, the same is true. In either case, competent trial
    counsel should know that this information should be in his affidavit. This
    court’s protocol concerning allegations of incompetent counsel contemplates
    that trial counsel will fully address the allegations of the appellant so
    that the court has before it all the available and relevant information. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    another example of trial counsel’s approach to his evidence arose when he
    volunteered on cross-examination that he had alluded to the risk of suborning
    perjury not just in a letter to the appellant’s counsel, but when he spoke
    about it to Ms. Cecchetto, Crown counsel on appeal. As a responsible officer
    of the court Ms. Cecchetto had to get him to disavow this on re-examination. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, these matters all reflect badly on trial counsel’s evidence. His
    affidavit is obviously wrong in several respects bearing directly on what
    happened at trial and relevant to the decision that the appellant not testify.
    His evidence on cross-examination is equally unreliable on this subject.
    And, when confronted, again and again he would change his evidence. Thus,
    even without looking to the many contradictions between his evidence and
    that of his two former colleagues on collateral matters, I can give no weight
    to his evidence on the fundamental question of who made the decision that
    the appellant not testify, and I would disregard it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    finding does not end the matter. The appellant must still establish that
    on a balance of probabilities trial counsel made the decision that he should
    not testify. However, the finding does clear the path for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    begin with, his evidence on this issue is unopposed by any credible evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, it seems to me that the strong presumption of competence of counsel
    is fatally undermined in these circumstances. Here, trial counsel swore an
    affidavit that was wrong in material respects, gave evidence on cross-examination
    that was unreliable, changed his evidence on cross-examination, was responsible
    for an erroneous account to Legal Aid, and appears not to have followed this
    court’s protocol for this kind of case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    his part, the appellant’s affidavit and evidence on cross-examination were
    consistent and unshaken. He maintained throughout that trial counsel told
    him the decision was trial counsel’s, and acted accordingly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown attacks his credibility on three bases. First, it says that the appellant
    is no novice to the criminal justice system and must have known he had the
    legal right to insist on giving evidence. The Crown says that since he did
    not do so he must have agreed not to testify.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s evidence was that, prior to his conviction in this case, no one
    ever advised him of his legal right and, in his prior criminal proceedings,
    he and his lawyer had always agreed that he should testify. Mr. Royle confirmed
    that this was what happened when he acted for the appellant and that the
    question of the appellant’s right to override counsel’s opinion never arose.
    Indeed, absent the circumstances of counsel being of the opinion that the
    client should not give evidence but the client wishing to do so, it is easy
    to imagine that the question would never come up. Thus, in my view, the Crown’s
    first argument does not undermine the appellant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown argues that the appellant’s criminal record undermines his credibility.
    The simple answer to this is that, while the appellant has two prior convictions,
    neither are for crimes of dishonesty. In my view, his record is not enough
    to weaken his evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the Crown says that if the appellant truly believed that trial counsel had
    taken his right to testify away from him, he would have raised this in his
    notice of appeal. However, the appellant has little formal education and
    cannot read. His in person notice of appeal was prepared for him by another
    inmate two days after he was sentenced. And, while he learned at some point
    that this issue could be a legal ground of appeal there is no evidence that
    he knew that when the notice of appeal was prepared. Moreover, Mr. Royle’s
    evidence confirmed that the appellant maintained his position that he wanted
    to testify both up to the point that Mr. Royle turned the file over to trial
    counsel and when Mr. Royle next spoke to the appellant after his conviction.
    Thus, I do not think the appellant’s credibility is undermined by the fact
    that the notice of appeal does not expressly raise counsel’s denial of the
    appellant’s right to testify.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I do not think that the Crown’s attacks on the appellant’s credibility
    succeed. His evidence remained consistent and was unshaken on cross-examination.
    It is not inherently improbable, and must be considered to be uncontradicted.
    Keeping in mind the caution with which it must be approached, I can nonetheless
    find no basis on which to question it. I would therefore conclude that the
    appellant has established that trial counsel denied him the right to testify
    by deciding he should not do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would therefore allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
