    relied on provocation and/or lack of intent to reduce the charge from murder

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

    we reject the submission that the trial judge erred in his instructions on
    the interplay of self-induced intoxication and self defence under s. 34(2)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The law on this subject is set out in <i>R.
    v. Reilly</i> (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and this court’s decision
    in <i>R. v. Nelson</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 449. We do not regard the decision
    in <i>R.&nbsp;v. Cinous </i>(2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) as dictating
    a different result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we would not give effect to the appellant’s submission that the trial judge
    erred in his instruction on the first branch of s. 34(2), i.e. whether the
    appellant was unlawfully assaulted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we acknowledge that it would have been preferable had the trial judge instructed
    the jury on the definition of assault under both s. 265(1)(a) and (b), we
    are satisfied that when the instructions on the first branch are read as
    a whole, the jury would not have been misled into thinking that s. 34(2)
    was unavailable if they were to find that the appellant was the one who actually
    struck the first blow. In this regard, we note that the trial judge told
    the jurors that if they believed the appellant’s version of the events or
    if it left them in a state of reasonable doubt, they were to acquit. Implicit
    in that instruction was the notion that if the deceased lunged at the appellant
    and the two men then started fighting, as the appellant claimed, the first
    branch of s. 34(2) would have been met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    on our view of the record, it is apparent that the issue of self defence
    turned not on the first branch of s. 34(2) but on the second and third branches,
    i.e. whether the appellant reasonably believed that the deceased would kill
    or seriously injure him and whether in responding as he did, the appellant
    reasonably believed that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death
    or serious injury. Our view is borne out in part by the failure of experienced
    defence counsel to object to the trial judge’s instructions on the first
    branch of s. 34(2). His failure points not to inadequate representation but
    to an understanding, seemingly shared by all, that if the deceased lunged
    at the appellant as he claimed, the first branch of s.&nbsp;34(2) would have
    been met. Our view is further supported by the question posed by the jury,
    which related not to the first branch of s. 34(2), but to the second and
    third branches. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    we would not give effect to the appellant’s submission that the trial judge
    erred by failing to relate the principles of <i>R. v. W. (D</i>.<i>)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) to the statements made by the appellant to the
    police. The trial judge told the jurors that they could consider the helpful
    parts of the appellant’s statements, along with the balance of the evidence,
    in deciding whether they entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s
    guilt. He also told the jury that in assessing the appellant’s defence of
    self defence, it was not a matter of weighing “the credibility of one side
    of the case against the other”; rather, if the jury believed the appellant’s
    evidence or if it left the jury in a state of reasonable doubt, it was to
    acquit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the jury was instructed to consider the appellant’s testimony along
    with those parts of his statements that were helpful to him in deciding whether
    it believed or had a reasonable doubt that he acted in self defence. Nothing
    more was required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we reject the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred in excluding
    the details of an argument that apparently took place between the deceased
    and a waitress earlier that evening. The proposed evidence was irrelevant.
    It had no probative value and only served to impugn the deceased’s character.
    Accordingly, the trial judge correctly excluded it. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Sentence
      Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant engaged in a vicious and unrelenting attack on the victim. The
    force used was manifestly excessive and far beyond what was required to subdue
    the victim, who was much smaller than the appellant. The sentence imposed
    is well within the range of sentences imposed in similar circumstances. We
    see no error in the trial judge’s analysis or conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction; we would grant leave
    to appeal the sentence but dismiss the appeal.</p>
