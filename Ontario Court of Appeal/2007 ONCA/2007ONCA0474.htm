    appellant mother has based her appeal on fresh evidence of the very significant
    progress she has made in turning her life around. She has been drug and alcohol
    free for three years. She has undertaken significant education at which she
    has excelled and she has involved herself in counselling where she has achieved
    considerable success. Clearly the appellant is to be commended for taking
    all of these steps. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue for this court is whether in these changed circumstances it is now
    in the best interests of the child to set aside the trial and appeal decisions
    granting Crown wardship with no access. We agree with the submissions of
    the Children’s Aid Society that in spite of the significant progress that
    the appellant has made, there is no basis to interfere with the conclusion
    reached by the trial judge and upheld by Justice Backhouse that it is in
    the best interests of the child who is now three-and-a-half years old, to
    be made a Crown ward with no access so that her foster parents can adopt
    her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the trial judge and the appeal judge found that in light of the history of
    drug addiction of the appellant and, very significantly, the history of violence
    by the appellant’s partner, <span class="headingNUMBER" style="text-align:left;
line-height:normal;">Mr. C.</span>, against her, that it would be highly
    risky and dangerous to place a child with the appellant and her partner.
    It is clear on the record that the Society has advised the appellant since
    2003 that she should not pursue a continuing relationship with Mr. C.
    Because the appellant elected to continue the relationship, the child would
    be returning to a home with both the appellant and <span class="headingNUMBER" style="text-align:left;
line-height:normal;">Mr. C.</span> and therefore
    to the very situation that the trial judge and the appeal judge described
    as highly dangerous. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the progress made by both the appellant and <span class="headingNUMBER" style="text-align:left;
line-height:normal;">Mr. C.</span>, we are
    not satisfied that the concerns of the judges below, particularly the trial
    judge who heard and saw the parties, are no longer relevant. On the other
    hand, the Children’s Aid Society advises that the child has been in a stable
    and loving home for three years with foster parents who would like to adopt
    her. In these circumstances, it is clearly in the best interests of the child
    that she be made a Crown ward with no access, so that she can be adopted
    and move forward with her life with the only parents she has known since
    she was only a few months old. </p>

    appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
