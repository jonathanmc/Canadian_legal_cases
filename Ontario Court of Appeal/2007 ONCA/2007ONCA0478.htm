    a seven-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of robbery, disguise
    with intent, and possession of an imitation firearm in relation to the March
    7, 2004 robbery of a Blockbuster video store in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga.  The appellant was acquitted of assaulting his former girlfriend,
    Victoria Taylor.  The appellant was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.  The
    appellant appeals his conviction and applies for leave to appeal against
    sentence, and if leave is granted appeals against sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issues on the conviction appeal are the ruling by the trial judge
    whereby he allowed the Crown to cross-examine the appellant’s mother, an
    alibi witness, on a collateral matter going to her credibility and the trial
    judge’s instructions to the jury about how it could use this evidence.  With
    respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant argues that the sentencing
    judge erred in principle in reaching his decision and the sentence should
    be reduced.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction
    appeal, grant leave to appeal against sentence, allow the sentence appeal,
    and reduce the sentence to two years less a day.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    approximately 10:45 p.m. on March 7, 2004, a man wearing a balaclava, silver
    makeup around his eyes, and a heavy dark jacket entered a Blockbuster video
    store at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Mavis Road and

    Mississauga.  When the clerk asked him what was in his bag, the man pulled
    out a handgun from inside his coat.  He asked where the safe was and was
    taken to the office that housed the safe.  Inside the office, the shift supervisor
    was putting money into the safe.  The robber pointed the gun at the supervisor
    and asked where the money was.  The supervisor opened the safe and removed
    the money.  At one point, the robber also pulled a hammer out of his bag,
    although the supervisor did not know why he did this.  The robber took the
    money and a metal cash box and fled the store. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the robbery was taking place, the clerk went back to the front counter and
    told the only customer in the store that there was a robbery in progress.  The
    clerk asked the customer to call 911.  The customer left the store, got into
    his car to observe the front of the store, and called 911.  When the robber
    exited the front door and fled on foot, the customer followed him in his
    vehicle while on the phone with 911.  Within a short time, he lost track
    of the robber.</p>

    three men who saw the robber offered similar descriptions: slim to medium
    build, between 5’6 and 5’10.  They assumed that by the robber’s manner of
    speech he was black.  One of the store employees thought he recognized the
    robber’s voice. </p>

    Taylor who was pregnant with the appellant’s child at the time of the offence
    testified that, just prior to March 7, the appellant told her that he was
    going to rob the Blockbuster store.  A few days after this comment, the appellant
    entered her apartment with a black bag, carrying a balaclava, wearing a puffy
    black jacket, and wearing makeup to lighten the area around his eyes.  He
    also had with him a hammer and a gun that Ms. Taylor said did not look real.  The
    appellant washed off the makeup and told her that he had robbed the Blockbuster
    store.  The appellant showed her the money as well as the cash box he had
    stolen.  The next day, the two went shopping and the appellant bought shoes,
    a $550 ring, and collector trading cards.</p>

    Taylor’s father visited the apartment sometime later in the spring.  Ms.
    Taylor told him that the appellant had robbed the store.  Ms. Taylor’s father
    called the store and confirmed there had been a robbery.  He then told Ms.
    Taylor to call the police.  She called Crime Stoppers as well as the appellant’s
    mother.  Ms. Taylor also called the Blockbuster store, spoke with the supervisor,
    and gave him the appellant’s name and contact information.  When the supervisor
    looked up the name of the appellant, he saw that he was a customer of the
    store. </p>

    Taylor was interviewed by the police and turned the cash box that the appellant
    had left with her over to them.  The cash box was later identified by the
    shift supervisor as the one stolen on March 7.  </p>

    appellant testified and denied that he was involved in the robbery.  He agreed
    that on a few occasions he had been to the Blockbuster store that was robbed.  It
    was the store closest to Ms. Taylor’s apartment.  The appellant testified,
    however, that he had never seen either of the store employees who witnessed
    the robbery.  When he was first arrested, the appellant was not sure what
    he had been doing on March 7.  His mother later remembered that she had been
    unable to attend a wedding on March 6, because she had to work, and that
    jogged her and his memory as to events of the next day, Sunday, March&nbsp;7.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that on the evening of the robbery he had gone to Ms.
    Taylor’s apartment between 6:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. after picking up groceries
    for her.  He stayed for an hour or so and then took the bus home.  He recalled
    that he was careful not to stay so long that he would miss the last bus which
    stopped running on this route early on Sunday evenings.  When he got home,
    he spoke to his mother, may have had something to eat, and then went to the
    basement to play video games.  He did not leave the house again that night.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argued that it was implausible that he would tell Ms. Taylor that
    he was going to commit a robbery, go back to her place immediately after
    the robbery, and leave evidence behind at her apartment given the poor state
    of their relationship at the time.  He maintained that Ms. Taylor fabricated
    the story and decided to call Crime Stoppers following an argument they had.  On
    the day of the argument, Ms. Taylor told the appellant that she was going
    to tell about the robbery to which the appellant replied, “They’ll never
    believe you.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s mother testified that when her son was first charged, she could
    not recall what she did on March 7.  A couple of months later she was looking
    at some documents relating to her work and realized that March 7 was the
    weekend that she had returned to work after three months at home with a bad
    back.  This assisted her in recalling her activities and her son’s whereabouts
    on that day.  On March 7, she started work at 7:00 a.m. and finished at 2:00
    p.m.  The appellant called her from his work at a Blockbuster video store
    (a different location from the one that was robbed) where he was employed.  The
    appellant told her that when he finished work at 5:00 p.m. he was going to
    stop by Ms. Taylor’s apartment.  Ms. Taylor had called and asked him to pick
    up some things for her. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span

    appellant’s mother recalled that her son came home shortly before 9:00 p.m.,
    had some dinner in the kitchen, said goodnight to his younger sister, and
    went to the basement where he spent a lot of his time.  The appellant’s mother
    went to her room shortly after.  She did not see the appellant again, but
    was of the opinion that she would have heard him had he left the house as
    the house is equipped with a security system.  In order to leave, the appellant
    would have had to disarm the system which makes a noise that the appellant’s
    mother was confident she would have heard.  The appellant’s mother checked
    on her children before leaving for work at 6:30 a.m. the next morning and
    noted that the appellant was asleep in his bed. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the defence objected to the Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant’s
    mother about an investigation conducted by the police in 1999.  In 1999,
    the appellant’s mother reported being robbed at gunpoint immediately after
    returning to her car from a bank machine.  The investigating officer tried
    to re-enact the robbery as described by the appellant’s mother but was unable
    to do so.  The appellant’s mother said that the police did not believe her.  As
    a result, she offered to take a polygraph test.  The test was never taken
    as she refused to miss work in order to take the test.  In the course of
    the cross-examination, the appellant’s mother agreed that she had signed
    a note indicating she did not want the charges further investigated.  She
    explained that she did so because the police were treating her as if she
    was the perpetrator.  She denied lying to the police about the incident and
    denied that she had been cautioned about being charged with public mischief.  She
    further denied the allegation that, after signing the statement indicating
    that she did not want the investigation to proceed, she told the investigating
    officer “Okay, it didn’t happen.”</p>

  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>1)         Did the trial judge err in
      allowing the Crown to cross-examine the appellant’s mother on her 1999
      complaint to the police?</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the Crown ought not to have been allowed to cross-examine
    the appellant’s mother on her alleged discreditable conduct.  In essence,
    the appellant submits that critical parts of the evidence elicited in the
    course of the cross-examination were inadmissible.  Once these portions of
    the evidence are excluded, the appellant submits the potential prejudicial
    impact of the balance of the evidence outweighs what little probative value
    remains.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    specific portions of evidence that the appellant submits were inadmissible
    are the appellant’s mother’s statement that the police thought she was lying
    and the statement that the police had cautioned her about making false reports.  This
    latter statement was contained in a question posed by Crown counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the appellant, his mother’s testimony about what the police might have
    thought was inadmissible hearsay.  This testimony was particularly prejudicial
    because the appellant was unable to cross-examine the police concerning their
    belief that the appellant’s mother had been lying.  The appellant also relies
    on <i>R. v. Ghorvei</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 63 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), for the proposition that a witness cannot be cross-examined on the fact
    that, in another proceeding, the witness was disbelieved.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    the appellant argues that the statement contained in the Crown’s question
    to the appellant’s mother, suggesting that she had been cautioned by the
    police, could be equated to cross-examination on withdrawn charges and is
    impermissible according to <i>R. v. Hoilett</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 449. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    these two portions of the cross-examination are removed, there is, according
    to the appellant, insufficient evidence from which the jury could draw an
    inference that the appellant’s mother lied to the police when she reported
    a robbery in 1999.  The cross-examination on the 1999 incident therefore
    would have no probative value but would instead cause prejudice if the jury
    used the inadmissible portions of evidence to conclude that the appellant’s
    mother was lying. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that the cross-examination was proper and that the challenged
    portions of the evidence adduced in the course of the cross-examination were
    admissible.  The Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant’s mother on her
    past conduct sought to show that in 1999 she had made a false report to the
    police.  If, based on the evidence, the jury drew the inference that the
    appellant’s mother had lied to the police in 1999, this would go to her credibility
    and could be weighed by the jury in assessing her testimony at this trial.</p>

    would reject the appellant’s submission that his mother ought not to have
    been cross-examined at all concerning her 1999 complaint to the police.  The
    trial judge dealt with this objection at trial.  He considered the proposed
    testimony and concluded that it was open to the jury to draw an inference
    from that evidence that the appellant’s mother had made a false report to
    the police in 1999.  </p>

    assessing the appellant’s mother’s credibility.  In reaching this conclusion,
    I take into account that this court should give considerable deference to

    on the fact that the trial judge, having allowed the cross-examination of
    the appellant’s mother regarding the 1999 complaint to the police, did not
    assist the jury on what use they could make of it.  The other three objections
    were: that the trial judge’s caution that questions posed are not evidence
    was not adequate; that the trial judge’s <i>R. v. (W.)D.</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C.
    (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), instruction was inadequate because he did not specifically
    refer to the appellant’s mother’s evidence; and that the trial judge’s statement
    that the Crown was not entitled to call evidence to contradict the appellant’s
    mother’s evidence that she did not lie to the police was misleading as it
    would suggest to the jury that evidence was available to contradict her but
    that some legal rule prevented the Crown from calling it.  I will deal with
    each of these objections in turn.</p>

    reviewing the evidence of the appellant’s mother regarding the 1999 complaint

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    were several aspects of the evidence regarding the 1999 incident that are
    of concern.  Specifically, the jury may not have understood that the appellant’s
    mother’s statement that the police did not believe her was hearsay and could
    not be used by them as evidence of the police’s belief, nor that their belief
    was reasonable or well founded.  The trial judge should have made it clear
    that the appellant’s mother was not accused of making a false report and
    that her understanding of what the police thought was admitted solely for
    the purpose of explaining why she acted as she did.  The belief of the police
    could not be used by the jury in assessing the appellant’s mother’s credibility. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this record, the use that the jury could make of this evidence was not obvious.
    The trial judge gave no general instruction on hearsay and his instruction
    respecting the appellant’s mother’s testimony was that her answers “constitute
    the evidence” that they should consider.  This may well have led the jury
    to understand that the appellant’s mother’s statement as to the police officers’ belief
    was evidence they could use in reaching their decision.  In my view, the
    trial judge ought to have tasked the jury as to the use of this testimony.  His
    failure to do so is, in the circumstances of this case, an error.</p>

    appellant argues that the trial judge’s caution to the jury that they should
    not consider the questions posed as evidence was not adequate in this case.  Of
    particular concern is the Crown’s question to the appellant’s mother that
    suggested she had been cautioned by the police not to make further false
    reports.  Because the appellant’s mother had denied the suggestion, the jury
    should have been told that this denial was the only admissible evidence and
    they should ignore the suggestion contained in the question.  If this question
    were considered as evidence by the jury, it would clearly be prejudicial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s caution to the jury was adequate.  At the outset
    of the trial, the trial judge cautioned the jury that questions by counsel
    were not evidence.  He repeated this caution in his final instructions to
    the jury.  In addition, the caution was repeated in the course of his review
    of the appellant’s mother’s evidence.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(c)       <u>Did the trial judge provide

    my view, the trial judge’s <i>(W.)D.</i> instruction was adequate in the
    circumstances of this case.  He gave this instruction twice.  Although on
    neither of the two occasions did he specifically refer to the appellant’s
    mother’s testimony, in the first he made reference to having “heard evidence
    that [the appellant] was at his home when the offence was alleged to have
    been committed.”  This would have been understood by the jury to include
    the appellant’s mother’s evidence.  I would, therefore, give no effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>

    the course of re-examining the appellant’s mother, appellant’s counsel may
    have left the jury with the impression that some inference could be drawn
    from the fact that the Crown did not call the police officers involved in
    the 1999 incident to contradict the appellant’s mother.  In final submissions,
    the Crown commented on this issue.  The trial judge dealt with this issue
    in his charge.  He instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, in the course
    of his questions, [appellant’s counsel] made some reference to the fact that
    the investigating officer from 1999 was not at court to contradict [the appellant’s
    mother].  I think this was an inadvertent reference because as a matter of
    law, the Crown is not entitled to call evidence to contradict a witness on
    this type of collateral issue.  In other words, the Crown had no right to
    call this officer, so the fact of his absence is itself of no significance.</p>

    available, that this evidence would favour the Crown, and that a rule of
    the court prevented the Crown from calling it.  I would reject this ground
    of appeal.  No objection was taken to this part of the charge.  In my view,
    the instruction was appropriate and would not have been misunderstood by

    respecting the 1999 complaint to the police.  The question I must pose is
    whether the verdicts would necessarily have been the same had the jury been
    adequately tasked as to the use they could make of that evidence.  In my
    view, that error occasioned little harm to the appellant and certainly none
    that would warrant a new trial.  I am satisfied that the verdict would necessarily
    have been the same had the error not been made.  The case against the appellant
    was overwhelming and there is no realistic possibility that a new trial would

    to the issue of harm, the evidence respecting the 1999 incident was directed
    at the credibility of the appellant’s mother.  It would not have affected
    the appellant’s credibility.  Although the trial judge found that the evidence
    respecting the incident was relevant to the appellant’s mother’s credibility,
    it would only be marginally so as the evidence was far from conclusive and
    the incident occurred some five years earlier.</p>

    addition, the appellant’s mother’s evidence did not provide the appellant
    with a firm alibi.  She did not testify to having seen the appellant at home
    at the relevant time but testified only that she believed that the appellant
    was in the basement of the house at the relevant time.  This, she explained,
    was because she was confident that she would have heard him turn off the
    alarm system had he gone out.  In final submissions, the Crown did not invite
    the jury to use the evidence regarding the 1999 incident to reject the appellant’s
    mother’s evidence concerning the evening of the robbery.  The Crown pointed
    out that the appellant’s mother’s evidence put the appellant within fifteen
    minutes from the robbery and, even accepting her evidence, the appellant
    had a nine hour window in which to commit the crime.  This evidence did not
    contradict Ms. Taylor’s clear evidence regarding the events of that evening.  Therefore,
    the jury did not have to disbelieve the appellant’s mother in order to convict
    the appellant.  I view the resulting harm as minimal.</p>

    evidence against the appellant was overwhelming.  Ms. Taylor testified that
    the appellant admitted to having committed the robbery.  Her evidence was
    supported by the fact that she had the cash box which had been stolen from
    Blockbuster and that she was able to produce it to the police.  There was
    no air of reality to the appellant’s explanation that someone else must have
    left it with her.  In addition, Ms. Taylor’s detailed evidence as to the
    appearance of the appellant when he went to her apartment after the robbery
    is strikingly similar to the descriptions of the robber given by the witnesses.  Ms.
    Taylor testified that the appellant had a balaclava, a hammer, and what appeared
    to be a silver coloured gun.  In particular, Ms. Taylor made note of the
    makeup around the appellant’s eyes to lighten his skin colour, a detail noted
    by another witness who described the makeup as silver.</p>

    appellant admitted that after an argument, Ms. Taylor threatened that she
    would report the robbery.  To this threat he responded: “They’ll never believe
    you”.  This is not the response that one would expect from someone who knew
    nothing about any robbery in the first place.</p>

    was also compelling evidence about the shopping spree the day after the robbery.  There

    that the purchases were made with birthday money given to the appellant three
    weeks before the date of his birthday.</p>

    addition, there was the evidence of the manager of the Blockbuster video
    store.  He testified that he thought the voice of the robber was familiar.  After
    receiving the robber’s name from Ms. Taylor, he looked up the appellant’s
    name in the store records and found that the appellant had an account with
    that store and had rented movies from there.  There was also the evidence
    of the customer who followed the robber after he left the store but lost
    sight of him in the direction of Ms. Taylor’s apartment.  The totality of
    this evidence led to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty.</p>

    the trial judge were to give the appropriate instructions to the jury as
    to the use they could make of the evidence concerning the 1999 incident,
    there is no realistic possibility that the verdict would be different.  I
    conclude, therefore, that this is a proper case to apply the curative proviso.  Accordingly,

    judge stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

    cases that would stand for that proposition.  To get two years less a day
    would require me to impose, for practical purposes, a sentence of one year
    less a day in relation to the robbery and then to make count two concurrent.  None
    of the cases cited that, in my opinion, are authority for the proposition
    that that sentence would be appropriate.</p>

    the facts of this case, I believe the sentencing judge erred in placing undue
    emphasis on the principle of deterrence without giving adequate weight to
    the rehabilitation of this youthful first offender.  I conclude that in light
    of the particular circumstances of this offender, a sentence of two years
    less a day is appropriate composed of one year less a day for the robbery,
    three months concurrent for disguise with intent, and a further one year
    minimum for the firearms offence. </p>

    these reasons, I would dismiss the conviction appeal, grant leave to appeal
    sentence, allow the sentence appeal, and vary the global sentence to two
    years less a day by varying the sentence for robbery from fifteen months
    to one year less a day.  The sentence for disguise with intent remains at
    three months concurrent with the robbery sentence and the sentence for possession
    of an imitation firearm remains at one year consecutive.</p>
