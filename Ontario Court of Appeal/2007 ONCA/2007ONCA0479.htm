style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal raises the issue of whether a trial judge has discretion pursuant
    to s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 [the “<i>Insurance
    Act</i>”] to grant relief from forfeiture of insurance in circumstances where
    the insured was unaware that his driver’s licence was suspended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For

  <h4>FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early hours of May 16, 2004, the respondent lost control of his vehicle
    while driving on the highway in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia, causing it to roll over and sustain serious damage both
    to the vehicle and to a custom sound system contained therein. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 20, 2004, the respondent reported his claim to his insurer – the appellant – and
    on September 29, 2004 he filed a sworn proof of loss form with supporting
    documentation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant admits that at the relevant time it insured the respondent’s vehicle
    under an Ontario Automobile Policy, which provided standard automobile coverage
    for the subject vehicle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the parties agree that at the time of the accident, the respondent’s driver’s
    licence was suspended. The Notice of Suspension of Driver’s Licence from
    the Ontario Ministry of Transportation was dated May 4, 2004 and stated that
    effective May 16, 2004 – the day of the accident – the respondent’s driver’s
    licence would be suspended for failure to attend a demerit point interview. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result of this suspension, the appellant says that the respondent was in
    breach of s. 7.2.2 of his policy of insurance and was therefore not entitled
    to indemnity. The respondent was informed of this policy violation by letter
    dated October 6, 2004.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent did not dispute that he had four speeding tickets in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in the year preceding the accident, which he did not pay. He claimed
    to be unaware that one of the repercussions that might result from an accumulation
    of unpaid fines was the suspension of his driver’s licence.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent said that he was away from the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Ontario from early December 2003 to the date of the accident. The parties
    agreed that during this time any notices to the respondent from the Ministry
    of Transportation would have been delivered to his home address in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, although aware that if the Ministry needed to contact him it
    would do so at this address, did not think it necessary to notify the Ministry
    if he was going to travel or be on vacation. He did not provide any forwarding
    address to the Ministry while he was away.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    he was away and had not seen the notice, the respondent was unaware at the
    time of the accident that his licence had been suspended just hours before.
    In fact, Mr. Williams was unaware his licence had been suspended until he
    was stopped for speeding in June or July following the accident. The appellant
    became aware of the suspension just before October 6, 2004 when it did a
    motor vehicle abstract following receipt of the respondent’s proof of loss
    form.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most
    of Mr. Williams’ driving experience prior to the action in question was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia. He understood that the practice in that province, when
    traffic fines remained unpaid, was to refuse the renewal of a person’s driver’s
    licence until the fines were paid. He was unaware that a person’s driver’s
    licence could be suspended between renewals because of a failure to pay accumulated
    fines. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant conceded that, subject to its suspension argument, there is no
    issue that the respondent had a valid policy of insurance at the time of
    the accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, this case was reduced to the sole issue of whether, on the facts as
    outlined above, the respondent should be relieved of forfeiture pursuant
    to s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.</p>
  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent’s policy of insurance is a standard
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario automobile policy which provides coverage for collision or upset
    involving the insured automobile.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    7.2.2 is titled “Illegal Use” and provides, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We won’t pay for loss or damage caused in an incident: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>if
    you drive the automobile while not authorized by law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    statutory conditions, which are part of every automobile policy of insurance
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>AUTHORITY TO DRIVE</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4. (1)   The insured shall not drive or operate
    or permit any other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the
    insured or other person is authorized by law to drive or operate it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    the appellant’s perspective, the case below was argued solely on the basis
    that because the respondent’s driver’s licence had been suspended at the
    time of the accident, the contractual coverage conditions as well as the
    statutory conditions, both quoted above, were breached. In these circumstances,
    there is no coverage under the policy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where there has been imperfect compliance with a
    statutory condition as to the proof of loss to be given by the insured or
    other matter or thing required to be done or omitted by the insured with
    respect to the loss and a consequent forfeiture or avoidance of the insurance
    in whole or in part and the court considers it inequitable that the insurance
    should be forfeited or avoided on that ground, the court may relieve against
    the forfeiture or avoidance on such terms as it considers just.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the appellant says this section does not assist the respondent because, by
    its own language, s. 129 clearly pertains only to post-loss aspects of non-compliance.
    In addition, the appellant relies on the decision of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Falk Bros. Industries Ltd. v. Elance Steel Fabricating Co.</i>,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 778. In <i>Falk</i> the court considered s. 109 of the <i>Saskatchewan
    Insurance Act</i>, R.S.S. 1978, c. S-26 [the “<i>Saskatchewan Act</i>”],
    which is identical to s. 129 of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Insurance Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts in <i>Falk </i>are set out succinctly in paragraph 2 of the judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Elance Steel Fabricating Co. Ltd<i>.</i> claimed
    under a bond issued by the Canadian Surety Company on account of a debt due
    and owing, together with interest for supply of metal to Falk Bros. Industries
    Ltd. Elance failed to give notice of its claim within the period specified
    in the bond, making its claim 28 days after expiry of the 120-day period
    for notice provided in paragraph 6 of the bond. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue before the court in <i>Falk, supra</i> was whether s. 109 empowered
    the court to grant relief against forfeiture for breach of a contractual
    condition prescribing a period within which notice of a claim must be given.
    The two sub-issues were (i) whether s. 109 was confined to statutory conditions
    as opposed to contractual provisions; and (ii) if s. 109 extends to contractual
    conditions, whether failure to give notice within the time prescribed by
    the bond constitutes “imperfect compliance” within s. 109 or, alternatively,
    “non-compliance”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in the first issue the court concluded that s. 109 should be read as empowering
    the court to grant relief from forfeiture for breaches of terms of insurance
    contracts in addition to statutory conditions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court reviewed the recent jurisprudence and concluded that generally courts
    tend to treat failure to give notice of claim in a timely fashion as imperfect
    compliance whereas failure to institute an action within the prescribed time
    period has been viewed as non-compliance, or breach of a condition precedent:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[C]ourts have generally been willing to consider
    granting relief from forfeiture where notice of claim has been delayed[.] </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the other hand, cases in which failure to meet
    a time requirement has been held to be non-compliance rather than imperfect
    compliance have largely been cases in which the time period was for the commencement
    of an action rather than giving notice[.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>See <i>Falk</i>, <i>supra</i> at paras. 18 and 19.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court went on at para. 20 to note, however,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Section] 109 gives the court power to relieve from
    such forfeiture or avoidance. But it is only in respect of such statutory
    conditions <u>as to proof of loss or other matters or things that are required
    to be done or omitted with respect to the loss</u> that the court has this
    power. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, the court stated at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I agree that failure to give notice of claim within
    a given period is a less serious breach than failure to bring an action within
    a stipulated time. I also agree that it relates to “proof of loss” or “any
    other matter or thing required to be done or omitted by the insured with
    respect to the loss.” I am therefore of the view that relief from forfeiture
    can be granted in respect of delayed notices of claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    answer to the appellant’s arguments, the respondent relies on a decision
    of Salhany J. in <i>Quarrie v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</i> (1997),
    32 O.R. (3d) 421 (Gen. Div.). In that case, Quarrie<i>, </i>the insured,
    was unaware that his driver’s licence had expired some four hours before
    he was involved in an accident. He had received no notice from the Ministry
    of Transportation of the expiry of his licence. The insurer, State Farm,
    refused Quarrie’s claim on the basis that he was not authorized by law to
    drive since he lacked a valid licence and had thereby violated his policy
    and s. 8(4)(1) of the statutory conditions. The issue was whether Quarrie
    was entitled to relief under s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act.</i></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court stated the issue in <i>Quarrie</i> at para. 9 as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The issue which I have to decide on this motion
    is whether the statutory or contractual conditions must be interpreted strictly
    or whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief under section 129. To put
    it another way, is a driver who had an honest belief that he was licenced
    to drive, when in fact he was not, entitled to relief from forfeiture under
    section 129 on the basis that it would be inequitable that his insurance
    should be forfeited or avoided because of failure to comply with a statutory
    or contractual condition?</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Salhany
    J. held that in these circumstances Quarrie was entitled to relief from forfeiture
    pursuant to s. 129.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, however, <i>Quarrie</i> was incorrectly decided. Section 129 does
    not give judges a broad discretion to “grant relief from forfeiture” generally
    where the conditions of an insurance policy are breached. To do so would
    grant the court power to alter the terms of a policy or conditions of coverage;
    this power was never envisioned by s. 129.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from <i>Falk</i>, as Madam Justice McLachlin stated, that “it is
    only in respect of such statutory conditions <u>as to proof of loss</u> or
    other matters or things that are required to be <u>done or omitted with respect
    to the loss</u> that the court has this power.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court’s power under s. 129 is only in relation to things or matters required
    to be done, <u>in relation to the loss</u>, that is, after a loss has occurred.
    The discretion a court has under s. 129 is a narrow one pertaining only to
    those policy conditions – statutory or contractual – that relate to proof
    of loss. It does not apply generally to all policy conditions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    there is an issue in relation to coverage or other policy conditions (i.e.
    conditions other than those that relate to proof of loss), that issue remains
    to be determined in the usual way in relation to the interpretation of insurance
    policies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    or not an insured was “authorized by law to drive” an automobile at the time
    of an accident is an issue of coverage where the language of the policy falls
    to be interpreted in the usual way. It is not a condition as to the proof
    of loss.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court respondent’s counsel argued that even if s. 129 is of no application,
    his client nevertheless was not in breach of section 7.2.2 of his policy.
    However, the case below was not argued on policy interpretation but, rather,
    solely on the applicability of s. 129. The record below therefore is lacking
    in respect of the necessary factual detail required to determine this case
    on the basis of policy interpretation. Before the trial judge there was only
    one issue as he put it “whether on the essentially undisputed facts, the
    plaintiff should be relieved from forfeiture.”  The trial judge said in his
    endorsement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For the purposes of this endorsement, I find as
    a fact that the plaintiff did not know of the suspension, nor do the circumstances
    warrant imputing such knowledge to him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was an agreed fact at trial that at the time of the motor vehicle accident,
    the plaintiff’s driver’s license was suspended. No issue was joined on whether
    or not the suspension equated with a lack of authorization to drive as per
    the policy wording.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    this reason, I would not decide this appeal on the basis of policy interpretation,
    but leave for another day that question where it arises on a proper record
    before this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, on the basis of s. 129, I am of the view that the judgment below
    must be set aside. Section 129 is not available in the circumstances of this
    case. The breach does not relate to imperfect compliance as to the proof
    of loss (i.e. after the loss). The breach, if there is one, occurred before
    the loss in question, albeit only hours before, and, accordingly, s. 129
    is of no application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    to the respondents’ alternative argument, relying on s. 98 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, in my view this court’s decision
    in <i>Stuart v. Hutchins</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 321 is dispositive of that
    argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below, and in its place issue
    a judgment dismissing the action with costs. The appellant is entitled to
    its costs of this appeal fixed in the sum of $3,500 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST – the figure to which counsel are agreed.</p>
