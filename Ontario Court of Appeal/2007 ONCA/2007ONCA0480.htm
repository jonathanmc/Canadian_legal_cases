  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is an appeal from the judgment of Speigel J. wherein she ordered that a boat
    owner’s liability policy issued by State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (“State
    Farm”) provided primary coverage to the appellant in respect of certain claims
    made against him. The said judgment further declared that after coverage
    under the boat owner’s policy had been exhausted, the Dominion of Canada
    General Insurance Company (“Dominion”), pursuant to a home owner’s policy
    issued to the appellant’s father, and State Farm, pursuant to a personal
    liability umbrella policy (“PLUP”) issued to Warren Tischler (the boat owner
    at all times relevant), were required to contribute equally in respect of
    claims made against the appellant. On consent of all parties, State Farm
    was added as a responding party to the application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this appeal, the appellant (supported by the respondent State Farm) argues
    that the application judge erred when she determined that the Dominion home
    owner’s policy and the State Farm PLUP are required to contribute equally
    to the claims against the appellant. The issue in this appeal is, therefore,
    the order in which the State Farm PLUP and the Dominion home owner’s policy
    are required to contribute to the claims against the appellant. To decide
    this issue, this court is required to consider the particular language of
    these two policies, along with the scope and application of the Supreme Court
    of Canada’s decision in <i>Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 695.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I agree with the appellant that the Dominion policy
    and the State Farm PLUP are not, by their language, required to contribute
    equally to the claims against the appellant. Rather, the State Farm PLUP
    is not called upon to respond to the claims until the limits of the Dominion
    home owner’s policy are exhausted. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4>Facts and Positions of the Parties</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    August 16, 2002 a collision occurred between two boats in the area of the
    Severn Channel about two hundred metres from the Big Chute Marina in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Township of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Georgian Bay. The consequences of that collision were tragic and have resulted
    in a number of actions for damages being commenced against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of the accident, the appellant was operating one of the boats involved
    in the collision with the consent of the boat’s owner, Warren Tischler.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    policies of insurance provide coverage to the appellant: (i) a boat owner’s
    liability policy issued by State Farm to Warren Tischler; (ii) a PLUP also
    issued by State Farm to Mr. Tischler and; (iii) a home owner’s policy of
    insurance issued by Dominion to the appellant’s father.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute that coverage is available to the appellant under these three
    policies. Further, there is no appeal taken from the application judge’s
    finding that the boat owner’s liability policy provides primary first loss
    insurance; that is to say the policy will pay the first dollar, and continue
    to pay until its limits are exhausted, all sums that the appellant becomes
    legally liable to pay as compensatory damages because of unintentional bodily
    injury or property damage.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I noted above, the issue raised on this appeal, simply stated, is which of
    the other two policies – the Dominion home owner’s policy or the State Farm
    PLUP – pays next, or, do those policies contribute equally or <i>pro rata</i> to
    the losses, if any, which exceed the liability limits of the boat owner’s
    policy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is the position of the appellant, supported by the respondent State Farm,
    that once the limits of the boat owner’s policy are spent or exhausted, it
    next falls to the home owner’s policy issued by Dominion to pick up any losses
    to the limit of that policy. If, and only if, amounts remain to be paid after
    the Dominion policy limits are spent or exhausted is the State Farm PLUP
    required to contribute. This is the order in which the policies have an obligation
    to contribute to the losses in this case because, unlike the other two policies,
    the PLUP is a true umbrella policy, not a first loss policy. The PLUP therefore
    provides coverage for a different level or layer of risk than the other two
    primary policies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent Dominion on the other hand says that the appellant’s approach
    in characterizing the policies at issue as either being primary, excess and/or
    umbrella is flawed and contrary to the reasoning of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Family Insurance</i>, <i>supra</i>. Rather, the proper approach
    is to first determine whether the “other insurance” clauses in the Dominion
    home owner’s policy and the State Farm PLUP can be reconciled. If they cannot –
    which the respondent Dominion urges is the case – then according to <i>Family
    Insurance </i>the policies should rateably contribute to the claims against
    the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge accepted Dominion’s arguments. She concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I conclude that the Umbrella Policy and the Home
    Owners Policy provide that each will cover the loss only if there is no other
    applicable insurance and that the “other insurance” clauses for each, although
    drafted slightly differently, seek to accomplish identical goals. Consequently,
    they conflict with each other and are irreconcilable.</p>

  <h4>Key Policy Provisions</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relevant coverage provisions of the Dominion home owner’s policy provide:</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    PLUP defines “net loss”, in part, as “the amount you are legally obligated

    [Emphasis in original.] “Retained limit” is defined, in part, as “the total
    limits of liability of any underlying insurance you may collect. The limits
    listed in the Declarations are the minimum you must maintain”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notably,
    the Dominion home owner’s policy agrees to pay “all sums you become legally
    obligated to pay” whereas the State Farm PLUP agrees only to pay “your net
    loss minus the retained limit” as those terms are defined in the policy as
    set out above. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the PLUP’s “other insurance” clause provides that the PLUP “is excess over
    any other valid and collectible insurance”.</p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I alluded to earlier, I am of the view that the application judge erred in
    accepting the respondent Dominion’s arguments as to the contribution obligations
    of the State Farm PLUP and the Dominion home owner’s policy. Dominion’s argument
    relies on two flawed assumptions. First, it equates the coverage provided
    by its home owner’s policy with the coverage provided by the PLUP and assumes
    that both policies provide primary coverage. Second, it assumes that in deciding <i>Family
    Insurance</i>, <i>supra </i>the Supreme Court of Canada, in effect, did away
    with umbrella or excess policies and, perhaps as a result, misinterprets
    the Supreme Court’s reasoning in <i>Family Insurance</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    with respect to the language in the two relevant policies of insurance in
    this case, in my view, the language of these policies and the coverage provisions
    therein are very different. They demonstrate that the coverage provided by
    the Dominion home owner’s policy and the PLUP is not equivalent; the policies
    cover different layers of risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, as noted above at para. 15 of these reasons, the coverage provided
    by the PLUP is specifically limited; this is not so in the home owner’s policy.
    Further, the home owner’s policy, by its language, provides primary coverage
    while the PLUP does not. The PLUP requires the existence of an underlying
    primary policy with minimum liability limits of $300,000 as a condition of
    coverage. If there is no underlying liability policy then the policyholder
    becomes a self-insurer to the extent of the minimum required underlying liability
    limit. On a review of the language of these two policies, it is not correct
    to say that both the home owner’s policy and the PLUP would provide coverage
    in the absence of the other.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    both policies provide similarly worded other insurance clauses, they will
    only effectively cancel one another out if, to use the language of <i>Family
    Insurance</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 28, the parties were under “coordinate
    obligation to make good the loss”. In this case there can be no doubt that
    the State Family PLUP, by its language, was written in contemplation of there
    being other underlying insurance coverage. The Dominion policy was not; its
    coverage language makes it clear that the intention was that it provide primary
    insurance. These are not policies of coordinate obligation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    be clear, I respectfully disagree with the respondent Dominion’s submission,
    and the application judge’s conclusion, that the “other insurance” clauses
    in the PLUP and the home owner’s policy are irreconcilable. Such a conclusion
    is only possible where the policies in question cover the same level of risk.
    The two policies in issue before this court do not. The PLUP is a true umbrella
    policy while the homeowner’s policy is a primary policy, which pays first
    dollar insurance coverage unless there is other insurance. The reference
    to “other insurance” in a primary policy can only reasonably refer to other
    primary insurance. Were it otherwise, the “other insurance” clauses in primary
    policies would make them excess or umbrella policies, which is clearly not
    the intent of a primary policy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in my view, both the application judge and the respondent Dominion have misinterpreted <i>Family
    Insurance</i>, <i>supra</i>. It seems to me that if the Supreme Court of
    Canada had intended to do away with any distinction among primary, excess
    and/or umbrella policies of insurance it would have done so in clear and
    express language to that effect.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    stated, the facts and issue before the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Family
    Insurance</i> were substantially different than those faced by this court.
    The court’s decision in <i>Family Insurance</i> is therefore not applicable
    to the facts in the present case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Briefly,
    the facts of <i>Family Insurance</i> were that a woman – Michelle Patterson – was
    injured in a fall from a horse. She sued Lesley Young, the owner of the stable,
    and Douglas Blanchard, the owner of the horse. At the time Ms. Young was
    insured under two policies of insurance – a home owner’s residential insurance
    policy with limits of $1 million and a commercial general liability policy
    with limits up to $5 million. Both insurers conceded that the liability claims
    against Young came within the scope of coverage provided by both policies.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court was called upon to consider the language of these two policies,
    each of which had similarly worded “other insurance”
    clauses. Namely, both policies contained “other insurance” clauses that declared
    the policies to be “excess coverage” to any other insurance coverage held
    by the insured, Young. Bastarache J., writing for the court, stated the issue
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The contest, then, is between the two insurers and
    concerns the extent to which each of them is liable to pay the insured’s
    claim. Each insurer relies on its “other insurance” clause as a means of
    shielding itself from primary liability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    the Supreme Court concluded that both policies revealed an intention to provide
    primary coverage, unless other valid insurance was available, in which case
    one of the policies was only intended to provide excess coverage; where other
    valid insurance was available the second policy was intended to limit its
    liability to only excess coverage, even where other insurance also provided
    excess coverage. Accordingly, as the Supreme Court noted at para. 20, the
    intentions of the policies gave rise to a “circular reasoning that does not
    resolve the problem of which policy provides primary coverage”. In short,
    the “other insurance” provisions of the policies were irreconcilable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court also stated that where the insured’s claims have been satisfied and
    the contest is one only between or among insurers in relation to contribution,
    the unilateral and subjective intentions of the insurers, unaware of one
    another at the time the contracts were made, are simply irrelevant. The insurers’ intentions
    are determined from the language they used in the policies.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 37 of its judgment the court noted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To endorse the intentions of one insurer over another,
    where both parties have sought to limit their liability to contribute and
    where the offending clauses, on their face, are irreconcilable, does violence
    to the intentions of the insurers and does not respect the obligation of
    both insurers to contribute.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have said, in my view the reasoning in <i>Family Insurance</i> simply does
    not apply in the circumstances of this case where, as I discussed above,
    the relevant policies of insurance provide different layers of coverage,
    or, stated another way, where the contest is between a primary insurer and
    an excess or umbrella insurer. Unlike the situation in <i>Family Insurance</i>,
    we are not here concerned with two primary policies (leaving the boat owner
    policy aside) with similar “other insurance clauses”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am supported in this view by the authors of <i>Couch on Insurance 3d</i>,
    loose-leaf (Deerfield, Il.: Clark Boardman Callaghan, 1995). They describe
    the clear differences between primary policies and umbrella or excess policies
    at 220:32:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>220:32 Nature of Excess and Umbrella Policies</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The question of allocating a loss among insurers
    often involves excess and umbrella insurers as well as various primary insurers.
    It is first of all important to understand the differences among these various
    types of policies. <i>Both true excess and umbrella policies require the
    existence of a primary policy as a condition of coverage.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The purpose of both excess and umbrella coverage
    is to protect the insured in the event of a catastrophic loss in which liability
    exceeds the available primary coverage. Accordingly, it is only after the
    underlying primary policy has been exhausted does the excess or umbrella
    coverage kick in. Unlike excess policies, however, umbrella policies often
    provide primary coverage for risks that the underlying policy does not cover.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Excess “other insurance” clauses, on the other hand,
    are devices whereby a primary insurer attempts to limit or eliminate its
    liability where another primary policy covers the risk. The intent of excess
    and umbrella policies to serve a different function from primary insurance
    policies with
    “other insurance” clauses can be discerned from the fact that different rate
    structures apply to excess and umbrella policies on the one hand, and primary
    policies with other insurance clauses on the other. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>And at section 220:41:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As a general rule, where two policies have competing
    excess “other insurance” clauses, the clauses cancel each other out and the
    policies pro rate. Likewise, two true excess policies at the same level of
    insurance pro rate the loss. As a rule, however, excess and umbrella policies
    are regarded as excess over and above any type of primary coverage, excess
    provisions arising in regular policies in any manner, or any escape clauses.
    Such is the case because umbrella policies are not an attempt by a primary
    insurer to limit a portion of its risk by labelling it “excess” nor a device
    to escape responsibility. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The issues between the parties turn on the wording

    J.A. therefore concluded that the trial judge had erred in deciding that
    the policies in <i>Trenton Cold Storage </i>were
    “on the same footing” in relation to the loss in that case. She wrote at
    paras. 21-24 and 26: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that
    his finding that IARW’s policy was excess was based solely on the “other
    insurance clauses” contained in the policy. In my view, this approach was
    fundamentally flawed. An insurance policy must be construed as a whole, not
    by its separate provisions. The trial judge failed to consider the fact that,
    apart from the possible effect of the other insurance clauses which must
    be considered in conjunction with other existing policies, there is nothing
    in the IARW policy to show an intent to provide anything other than primary
    coverage. The policy clearly provides for an obligation to pay and a duty
    to defend upon the happening of a specified occurrence without any reference
    to, or requirement that there be, underlying insurance. The policy further
    contains a clause that given the insured permission to secure “other insurance
    being the excess of the insurance” provided by the policy. On its face, the
    IARW policy appears to be primary. Its character becomes much more apparent
    when the wording of the policy is compared to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Paul’s policy.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The wording used in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    St. Paul policy is significantly different. The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Paul policy clearly shows an intent not only to provide coverage with
    respect to certain risks but to limit the company’s liability to the loss
    in excess to that which may be collected by the insured under any underlying
    insurance. Further, it obligates the insured to maintain underlying insurance
    to the extent provided for in Schedule A during the currency of the policy.
    If the insured fails to maintain the stipulated underlying insurance or its
    equivalent, the insurer’s liability is limited to the amount for which it
    would have been held liable had the insurance been maintained. Therefore,
    in effect, the limits of the underlying policies listed in Schedule A operate
    as a kind of deductible. The policy also provides for “drop-down” coverage
    where there is no underlying insurance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Paul’s policy expressly and correctly identifies itself as an umbrella
    policy. An umbrella policy generally provides two types of coverage: standard
    form excess coverage; and broader coverage from that provided by the underlying
    insurance including a duty to defend lawsuits not covered by the underlying
    coverage. An umbrella policy is in effect a hybrid policy that combines aspects
    of both a primary policy and an excess policy. [Citations omitted].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The distinction between primary and excess insurance
    is succinctly set out in <i>St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co. v. Lexington Insurance
    Co</i>. (1996), 78 F.3d 202 (5th Cir.), at footnote 23, quoting from <i>Emscor
    Manufacturing Inc. v. Alliance Insurance Group </i>(1994), 879 S.W.2d 894,
    at 903 (Tex. App.), writ denied):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Primary insurance coverage is insurance coverage
    whereby, under the terms of the policy, liability attaches immediately upon
    the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to the liability. An excess
    policy is one that provides that the insurer is liable for the excess above
    and beyond that which may be collected on primary insurance. In a situation
    where there are primary and excess insurance coverages, the limits of the
    primary insurance must be exhausted before the primary carrier has a right
    to require the excess carrier to contribute to a settlement. In such a situation,
    the various insurance companies are not covering the same risk; rather, they
    are covering <i>separate and clearly defined layers of risk</i>. The remote
    position of an excess carrier greatly reduces its chance of exposure to a
    loss. This reduced risk is generally reflected in the cost of the excess
    policy.”
    [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the IARW
    coverage is primary. The “other insurance” clauses in the policy do not change
    this characterization. The only effect of the “other insurance clauses” would
    be to require a second primary insurance carrier to share in IARW’s liability.
    The key to the obligation to share is that the other carrier would have to
    provide coverage at the same level, in this case primary coverage, and not
    excess coverage that insures a “separate and clearly defined layer of risk”.
    A primary insurer cannot  use an “other insurance clause” to require an umbrella
    carrier to share in its liability. [Citations omitted.]</p>
