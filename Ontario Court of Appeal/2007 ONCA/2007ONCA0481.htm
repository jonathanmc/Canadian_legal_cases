style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal, which concerns the admissibility of a young person’s statement to
    the police, arises in the context of a Crown appeal from the acquittal of
    the seventeen-year-old respondent on charges of robbery and use of a disguise
    in the commission of an indictable offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    grounds of appeal engage a discussion of s. 146(2)(b)(iv) of the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act, </i>S.C. 2002, c. 1 (<i>YCJA</i>) regarding the required
    explanation to be given to a young person making a statement to the police.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  It also engages s. 146(6) of the <i>YCJA</i> regarding
    the discretion given to a youth justice court judge to admit a young person’s
    statement despite a
    “technical irregularity” in compliance with s. 146(2)(b). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the police informed the respondent that he had the “right” to
    have a lawyer, or other specified adult with whom he consulted, present when
    he gave his statement.  However, the trial judge found that this information
    did not conform with s. 146(2)(b)(iv), which requires the police to tell
    the young person that any statement <b>must</b> be taken in the presence
    of any lawyer or adult with whom the young person has consulted<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>, unless the young person desires otherwise.  The
    primary question on the appeal is whether telling the young person about
    his or her right to have a third party present is equivalent to explaining
    to the young person, as required by s. 146(2)(b)(iv), that any statement
    given to the police is required to be made in the presence of a consulted
    third party, unless the young person desires otherwise.  If it is not equivalent,
    a secondary question arises regarding whether the statement may nonetheless
    be admitted into evidence pursuant to s. 146(6). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, since in my view there is an important difference
    between a right and a requirement, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on an anonymous tip, Sergeant Smyth (Smyth), the officer in charge of the
    investigation, contacted the respondent about his possible involvement in
    a convenience store robbery in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sudbury.  Since no other evidence linked the respondent to the crime, Smyth
    knew he did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the respondent. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Smyth
    went to the address where the respondent lived with his uncle, and asked
    the uncle to have the respondent contact Smyth.  When the respondent telephoned
    Smyth that evening, Smyth told the respondent that he had been named as a
    suspect in the robbery.  The respondent agreed to an interview at the police
    station the next day.  During this telephone call, Smyth neither asked nor
    suggested to the respondent that his uncle, or any other adult, could accompany
    him to the police station.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    following afternoon, Smyth picked the respondent up at his home.  Smyth did
    not speak with the respondent’s uncle nor ask the respondent whether he wanted
    his uncle to accompany him to the police station. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    at the police station, Smyth began the interview, which was videotaped, by
    reviewing with the respondent the Greater Sudbury Police Service Statement
    of a Young Person form (the Form).  In the course of this review, Smyth told
    the respondent that he was investigating a robbery and that the respondent
    was not under arrest.  Following the information set out in the Form, Smyth
    advised the respondent that he was under no obligation to make a statement
    and that any statement could be used in evidence in proceedings against him.  He
    told him about his right to consult a lawyer, the availability of Legal Aid,
    and about his right to consult with an adult.  Smyth asked the respondent
    to explain these rights to him in his own words, which the respondent did,
    indicating his understanding that he could speak to a lawyer or call an adult
    if he wished.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the issue in this appeal, Smyth had the following exchange with the respondent:</p>
  <p class=wrap style='

    the respondent was told he had the right to have a parent, adult relative,
    or other appropriate adult “here with you”.  In addition, when Smyth read
    the waiver to the respondent, he told him that he had the right to have “any
    of these [consulted] people” present when he made a statement. The respondent
    acknowledged receipt of this information by signing a form of waiver.  After
    obtaining the respondent’s signature, Smyth told the respondent to let Smyth
    know if he changed his mind about waiving his rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no time, did Smyth explain to the respondent that any statement he made was
    required to be made in the presence of any consulted third party.  Smyth
    proceeded to interview the respondent about the robbery applying a skilled
    interviewing technique during which he expressed empathy for the respondent’s
    unfortunate personal circumstances, including the recent death of his grandmother
    who had been the respondent’s sole caregiver.  Smyth expressed an interest
    in various aspects of the respondent’s personal life.  He told the respondent
    a lengthy story about Smyth’s younger brother confessing to an isolated incident
    of car theft so that his involvement would not “eat away” at him.  When the
    respondent made no admission, Smyth implied that the police had DNA and videotaped
    evidence implicating the respondent and that he had no doubt about the respondent’s
    involvement.  Smyth appealed to the respondent whom he described as a “decent
    guy” to admit to an offence that was “out of character”
    and that was not intended to hurt anyone.  At the end of the hour-long interview,
    the respondent provided a statement.  He was charged and arrested.  </p>

    Crown acknowledges that the police omitted to tell the respondent about the
    requirement that any statement must be made in the presence of a consulted

    Crown takes the position that there is no difference in substance between
    a “right” to have a consulted third party present and the “requirement” that
    such a person be present.  </p>

    if there is a difference between a young person’s right and a requirement
    on the police, the Crown argues that the critical information intended by
    s. 146(2)(b)(iv) was conveyed to the respondent, and understood by him, so
    that the police substantially complied with that provision.  Further, the
    Crown argues, even if there were a violation of s. 146(2)(b)(iv), the trial
    judge erred in failing to admit the statement under the curative provision
    of s. 146(6).  The Crown also submits that – in the absence of any evidence
    from the respondent - the trial judge erred by presuming that the respondent
    would not have made the statement if he had been given the required information
    but rather that the respondent would have exercised his right to consult
    and would have insisted on the presence of a consulted third party.<span style='background:yellow;'> </span></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    terms of context, there are three areas of law that govern the admissibility
    of statements made by young persons to persons in authority: the common law
    rules of voluntariness; the relevant provisions of the Charter; and the statutory
    safeguards provided by the <i>YCJA</i>.  Section 2 of the <i>YCJA</i> defines
    a young person as a person who is twelve years old or older, but less than
    eighteen.  The rights set out in the <i>YCJA</i> apply equally to all such
    persons, whether they are seventeen or whether they are twelve, whether they
    are individually mature or immature for their age, and whether they are experienced
    or inexperienced with the criminal justice system. </p>

    safeguards reflect the statute’s purpose, which is set out in the following
    extracts from the <i>YCJA</i> preamble:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>WHEREAS members of society share a responsibility
    to address the developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and
    to guide them into adulthood;</p>
  <p class=flushleft align=center style='

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>WHEREAS Canada is a party to the United Nations
    Convention on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have
    rights and freedoms, including those stated in the <i>Canadian Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</i> and the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, and have
    special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    extracts recognize that young persons are evolving towards, but have not
    reached maturity and, until they do so, need adult guidance.  For this reason,
    Parliament gave young persons “special guarantees of their rights and freedoms”,
    in recognition of their need for different processes or procedures to ensure
    their fair treatment.</p>

    the context of s. 56(2) of the <i>YOA, </i>the predecessor to s. 146 of the <i>YCJA</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada explained the reasons for additional protections,
    based on the susceptibilities of young persons to be influenced by persons
    in authority, in <i>R. v. J. (J.T.),  </i>[1990] 2 S.C.R. 755<span

style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>at paras. 18 - 21:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>By its enactment of s. 56, Parliament has recognized
    the problems and difficulties that beset young people when confronted with
    authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may seem unnecessary and frustrating to the police
    and society that a worldly wise, smug 17-year-old with apparent anti-social
    tendencies should receive the benefit of this section.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it
    must be remembered that the section is to protect all young people of 17
    years or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;A young person is usually far more easily impressed
    and influenced by authoritarian figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the bravado
    and braggadocio that young people may display, it is unlikely that they will
    appreciate their legal rights in a general sense or  the consequences of
    oral statements made to persons in authority; certainly they would not appreciate
    the nature of their rights to the same extent as would most adults. Teenagers
    may also be more susceptible to subtle threats arising from their surroundings
    and the presence of persons in authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;A young person may be
    more inclined to make a statement, even though it is false, in order to please
    an authoritarian figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no doubt in recognition of the
    additional pressures and problems faced by young people that led Parliament
    to enact this code of procedure. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is also not without significance that prior to
    the passage of the Young Offenders Act courts had recognized that the confessions
    of young people should not be treated in the same manner as those of adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
    example, in Re A, [1975]
    5 W.W.R. 425, the Alberta Supreme Court suggested a number of safeguards
    before an admission of a young person would be deemed to be admissible, including
    the requirement that an adult relative accompany a young person to the place
    of interrogation and that a caution be given in words that the young person
    would understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have thus extended certain protections
    to young persons when dealing with the police and the Act has simply expanded
    upon and codified that practice. </p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>…</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is just and appropriate that young people be
    provided with additional safeguards before their statements should be admitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
    56(2) to (6) inclusive specify the additional protection which must be provided
    to all young people under the age of eighteen. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    years later, in <i>R. v. I.(L.R.) and T.(E.)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 504, the
    Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    reiterated the rationale for the s. 56 <i>YOA</i> protections at para. 23:  “young
    persons generally have a lesser understanding of their legal rights than
    do adults and are less likely to assert and exercise fully those rights when
    confronted with an authority figure.”       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    s. 146(2)(b)(iv) is an enhanced procedural protection that Parliament deemed
    important, among other purposes, to provide reasonable protection for a young
    person confronted by police officers <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>seeking a statement.</span>  As the Supreme
    Court of Canada has explained, this protection is important because, no matter
    how well-intentioned the officer, young persons are susceptible to feeling
    intimidated by the police, whom they consider to be persons of significant
    authority and power.  In addition, young persons may lack the maturity to
    consider the consequences of unburdening themselves of their misdeeds, particularly
    when encouraged to do so by an apparently understanding (or, alternatively,
    formidable) police officer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    this context, it is apparent that s. 146(2)(b)(iv) must be interpreted liberally  to
    ensure a young person is treated fairly and to ensure that only voluntary
    statements elicited in compliance with the Act are admitted into evidence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i><span>           </span>Sub-paragraph 146(2)(b)(iv) – right

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    considered in this context, and mindful of the parliamentary purpose of the
    enhanced procedural protections, in my view, the failure to tell the respondent
    about the requirement on the police was a breach of s. 146(2)(b)(iv).  That
    breach denied the young person important information that would have enabled
    him to decide whether to consult a third party. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    reach this conclusion because, on a plain reading of the legislation, there
    is an important distinction drawn between a
    “right” of a young person on the one hand and a “requirement” put on the
    police on the other.  That this distinction was intentional is apparent from
    a consideration of the structure of s. 146(2)(b).  While s. 146(2)(b)(iii)
    refers to a young person’s “right” to consult counsel, in contrast, s. 146(2)(b)(iv)
    expressly places an obligation on the police.  Thus, it is clear that Parliament
    deliberately distinguished between information about a young person’s right
    and about an obligation on the police. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    distinction is consistent with the purpose of protecting young people in
    light of their lack of maturity and their susceptibility to yield to authority.  If
    a young person is informed that, if they consult a third party, that person
    must be present during the taking of a statement, the young person will be
    alerted by that information to the significance of any statement he or she
    may provide and, importantly, will be in a better position to make an informed
    decision about whether to consult a lawyer or an adult.  In other words,
    information that any statement must be made in the presence of any consulted
    third party is critical so that the young person can make an informed decision
    about whether to consult a lawyer or an adult in the first place.  Thus,
    in my view, the “requirement” provides important information that is essential
    to the enhanced procedural protection provided by s. 146(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    s. 146(2)(b) required Smyth to “clearly”
    explain the information set out in that subsection.  It cannot be a “clear” explanation
    if the police fail to tell the young person that counsel and any other consulted
    third party must be present during the taking of any statement.  As I have
    said, only after the police obligations have been “clearly explained” to
    the young person, and he or she has been given all the required information,
    can the young person provide an informed answer to the question of whether
    he or she “desires otherwise”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    importance of providing the young person with the tools necessary to make
    an informed decision is particularly important because the <i>YCJA</i> does
    not require any notice to parents (or parental equivalents or substitutes)
    when the police want to interview a young person.  No notice is required
    until the young person is arrested and detained in custody or until a summons
    or appearance notice is issued.  The absence of parental notification when
    a young person is taken for questioning underscores the importance of ensuring
    that the young person is fully informed of his or her procedural protections
    before he or she makes a decision. </p>

    interpretation of s. 146(2)(b)(iv) is consistent with the objectives and
    principles of the <i>YCJA</i>.  In addition, it does not place an undue burden
    on the police.  It is not difficult to tell the young person about the requirements
    of the section.  It is apparent that a uniform form that correctly addresses
    all of the procedural protections would facilitate uniform compliance with
    s. 146(2) and, more importantly, would ensure that a young person had his
    or her rights, and the obligations of the police, clearly explained.  </p>

    in <i>R. v. D.J.M., </i>[1991] O.J. No. 1965 (O.C.J. - Prov. Div.), because
    it first provided the young person with an overview of all his or her rights

    the appellant argues that s. 146(2)(b)(iv) information about a right (or
    an entitlement) is equivalent to information about the requirement, none
    of the authorities cited in support of this proposition analyze the provision
    at issue or discuss the requirement on the police.</p>

    in a somewhat different factual context, this court already held that the
    police must advise a young person of the requirement that any statement be
    made in the presence of a consulted third party present.  In <i>R. v. A.(W.), </i>[1989]
    O.J. No. 2170 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ), where the young person had consulted a lawyer, the police did not tell
    him about the requirement.  The form in that case only informed the young
    person that he “may” have his lawyer present during the interview and, later,
    that he had the “opportunity” to have his lawyer present, which was his
    “right”.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    writing for this court, Houlden J.A. explained, “the printed form or a sufficient
    oral explanation had to make it clear to him that the person consulted <b>must
    be present</b> when he made his statement to the police unless he otherwise
    desired”.  [Emphasis added.]  Since this requirement had not been met, the
    court held that the trial judge correctly excluded the young person’s statements. </p>

    in that case, the young person had exercised his right to counsel, the statutory
    requirement on the police is the same whether or not the young person chose
    to consult a third party.  Accordingly, the absence of a prior consultation
    cannot dictate a different result.  In any event, as the trial judge noted,
    one cannot determine whether the respondent in this case may have exercised
    a right to consult counsel or another third party if he had known that any
    statement had to be taken in the presence of that consulted third party. </p>

    am not persuaded to a different result by <i>R. v. A.M., </i>[1998] M.J.
    No. 525 (C.A.).  In that case, the young person was told and understood that
    she was <b>entitled</b> to have a consulted third party present when she
    gave her statement, but not that there was a <b>requirement</b> that such
    a person be present, unless the young person desires otherwise.  Although
    the court in <i>A.M.</i> considered this explanation to be “deficient” and “not
    completely accurate”, it held the young person’s statement was admissible
    because, even if she had been told of the requirement, she would still have
    provided her statement.  However, not only is the factual matrix in <i>A.M. </i>different,
    more importantly, that court did not discuss the requirement to have a consulted
    third party present as a component of the total information a young person
    must have before deciding whether he or she will consult a third party in
    the first place.  In the absence of such a discussion on the very point raised
    in this appeal, I do not find <i>A.M.</i> to be helpful on this issue. </p>

      v. B.S.M., </i>[1995] M.J. No. 85 (C.A.) explained that “what constitutes
      a sufficient explanation under [s. 146(2)(b)(iv)] is fact specific.  I
      agree.  While a uniformly clear explanation is to be both preferred and
      required, it may be that a different emphasis is necessary in one case
      than another.  The trial judge’s finding in this case that there was not
      a clear explanation of the requirement is entitled to deference. </p>

    these reasons, in my view, it was open to the trial judge to find a breach
    of the respondent young person’s rights under the <i>YCJA</i>.  I would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

      the respondent was deprived of a substantial informational component of
      s. 146(2)(b)(iv), the breach cannot be considered a “technical irregularity” of
      the kind to invoke a consideration of s. 146(6).  Accordingly, it is not
      necessary for me to weigh whether the admission of the statement would
      bring the principle of enhanced procedural protection for young persons
      into disrepute. </span></p>
