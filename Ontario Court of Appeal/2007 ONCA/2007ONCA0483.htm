style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    reasons concern four appeals arising from proceedings involving Stelco Inc.
    under the <i>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the “<i>CCAA</i>”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 2004, Stelco filed for protection under the <i>CCAA</i>. At the time,
    it owed almost $550 million to various creditors. (With post-filing interest,
    the amount increases to approximately $640 million.)  In January 2006, after
    two years of efforts to raise capital, sell assets, and negotiate a compromise,
    a plan of arrangement and reorganization was sanctioned by Farley J. as fair
    and reasonable, thereby putting in motion the process by which Stelco would
    emerge from restructuring with its debt reorganized.  In simple terms, the
    creditors agreed to release and discharge all claims against Stelco in exchange
    for a distribution of cash and new securities.  These appeals concern how
    those assets are to be distributed amongst classes of the creditors, and
    include disputes over the ranking of priorities, the characterization of
    debt, and the value to be attributed to the new securities.</p>

    these reasons, we summarize the facts most relevant to the appeals.  The
    motion judge reviewed the facts in greater detail in his reasons for judgment
    released on August 9, 2006, and on March 6, 2007, which are reported at 20
    B.L.R. (4th) 286 and [2007] O.J. No. 808, respectively. </p>
  <h2>II.  THE NOTEHOLDERS’ APPEAL (C46248)</h2>
  <h2>(a)  Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Stelco filed for protection under the <i>CCAA</i> on January 29, 2004 (the “Filing
    Date”), it had two principal debt obligations:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Debentures: There were
    two classes of senior debentures: 10.4% Debentures issued in 1989 in the
    principal amount of $125,000,000 and 8% Debentures issues in 1999 in the
    principal amount of $150,000,000.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Notes: There was one
    class of unsecured subordinated debentures issued in 2002 in the principal
    amount of $90,000,000 and bearing an interest rate of 9.5% per annum.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>In these reasons the parties representing the holders of
    the Debentures will be referred to as the
    “Debentureholders” and the parties representing the holders of the Notes
    will be referred to as the “Noteholders”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the Note Indenture, the Noteholders agreed to subordinate their entitlement
    to repayment in full of the “Senior Debt” (the
    “Turnover Provisions”).  It is agreed that the Debentures constitute Senior
    Debt as defined in the Note Indenture. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Article
    6.2 of the Note Indenture specifically addresses the operation of the Turnover
    Provisions in the event of insolvency proceedings.  Article 6.2(2) requires
    any payment or distribution of assets to the Noteholders in such circumstances
    be paid to the holders of Senior Debt to the extent necessary to result in
    payment in full of the principal and interest owing to them after giving
    effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of Senior
    Debt.  Article 6.2(3) provides that if any payment or distribution is paid
    to the Noteholders it shall be held in trust for the Senior Debt Holders
    until the principal of and interest on the Senior Debt shall be paid in full.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 20, 2006, Farley J. approved a plan of arrangement or compromise
    (the “Plan”) to reorganize Stelco’s debt obligations.  The Plan became effective
    on March 31, 2006 (the “Effective Date”) at 11:59 p.m. (the “Effective Time”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    accordance with the Plan, the Debentureholders filed proofs of claim totalling
    $342,655,664.  On the Effective Date, they received an initial <i>pro rata</i> share
    of the Plan distribution in the form of cash, New Common Shares, New Warrants,
    and New Floating Rate Notes (the “New FRNs”) (collectively, the “Distributed
    Assets”).  The Distributed Assets were comprised of $52,243,533 in cash,
    US$121,486,000 in New FRNs, 4,004,829 New Common Shares, and 733,311 New
    Warrants.  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the New Common Shares were
    issued at a price of $5.50 per share.  Based on that price per share, the
    New Warrants would be worth $1.44 per warrant using the Black-Scholes Model.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Plan also provided for a distribution of $20,075.359 in cash, US$40,522,000
    in New FRNS, 849,325 New Common Shares and 244,528 New Warrants to the Noteholders
    (the “Turnover Proceeds”).  The Plan required that the Turnover Proceeds
    be held in trust by the Monitor pending the determination of entitlement
    to the Turnover Proceeds pursuant to the Turnover Provisions.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 7, 2006, Farley J. issued an order as to how the litigation over the
    Turnover Proceeds was to be conducted. Pursuant to that order, the Debentureholders
    filed a claim stating that they were entitled to the Turnover Proceeds.  2074600
    filed a claim stating that the debt owed to it was Senior Debt and had priority
    over the amount owing to the Noteholders.  (This claim is the subject of
    a separate appeal and is discussed below.)  The Noteholders responded with
    a counterclaim denying the existence of any Deficiency and insisting that
    they were entitled to the entire Turnover Proceeds.  The hearing took place
    before the motion judge on July 17 through 21, 2006.</p>

    the reasons that follow, we agree with the motion judge that while they are
    not parties to the Note Indenture between Stelco and the Noteholders, the
    Senior Debt Holders can rely on trust principles to provide an exception
    to the privity of contract doctrine, entitling them to enforce the Turnover
    Provisions in the Note Indenture that constitutes the Noteholders trustees
    of the Turnover Proceeds for the Senior Debt Holders once the Noteholders
    receive those Proceeds.  It is therefore unnecessary for us to decide whether
    the trial judge erred in allowing the Senior Debt Holders to enforce the
    Indenture as third party beneficiaries by extending to this case the principled
    exception to privity of contract found in <i>Fraser River</i> <i>Pile &amp; Dredge

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rather,
    their principal argument below was that the Senior Debt Holders could not
    rely on Article 6.2(3) of the Note Indenture because the Turnover Proceeds
    have been paid to the Monitor under the Plan and have not therefore been “received” by
    the Noteholders for the purposes of the Article.  Thus no trust has arisen
    and the Senior Debt Holders have no beneficial interest to enforce.  The
    motion judge dismissed this argument as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This is an argument
    of form over substance. The Monitor has no interest in the Distributions.  For
    the purpose of this proceeding, payment to the Monitor satisfies the requirement
    of delivery of the corpus of the trust to the Noteholders.  The only other
    possibility – that the Distributions were paid to the Senior Debt Holders – is,
    of course, denied by the Noteholders and would render consideration of this
    issue unnecessary.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Plan, approved by court order, creates a trust in which the Monitor holds
    the Turnover Proceeds in trust pending determination by the court of whether
    the Senior Debt Holders or the Noteholders are ultimately entitled to them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subject
    to any right of subordination available to the Senior Debt Holders, the Noteholders
    are ultimately entitled to the Turnover Proceeds, pursuant to the terms of
    the Plan.  In other words, the Noteholders hold the beneficial interest in
    the Turnover Proceeds but that interest is not unfettered.  It is subject
    to the rights of the Senior Debt Holders if the court should so order.  As
    a consequence, the Noteholders cannot be said to have the entire equitable
    interest in the Turnover Proceeds.  The Senior Debt Holders’ interest gives
    them the right to engage the assistance of the court to effect the full implementation
    of the trust created by the Plan.</p>

    the Senior Debt Holders effectively ask the court:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) to order
    that the Turnover Proceeds be paid to the Noteholders who, on receipt, are
    obliged by Article 6.2(3) to hold the proceeds in trust for the Senior Debt
    Holders and to pay those proceeds over to them until they are paid in full,
    and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) to enforce
    their right as beneficiaries of the arrangement set up by Article 6.2(3)
    to this payment.</p>

    agree that the court below was correct to so order.  The payment to the Noteholders
    is ordered simply as a step in the full implementation of the arrangement,
    and once these steps are taken, the Noteholders are to be held to the terms
    of the trust that results.  The Senior Debt Holders are entitled to have
    the court ensure that the proper beneficial interests in both trusts are

    <i>Greenwood</i><i>
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    Plaza</i>, <i>supra</i>, to argue that unless the Senior Debt Holders can
    establish that Stelco was contracting as trustee for them in entering into
    the Note Indenture, they cannot rely on the trust exception to privity of
    contract so as to enforce Article 6.2(3).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not agree.  As we read <i>Greenwood Shopping Plaza</i>, the fundamental
    question is whether Article 6.2(3) can be shown to create a trust in favour
    of the Senior Debt Holders once property flows.  While evidence that Stelco
    contracted with that intention would point to that conclusion, here the language
    of the Article itself is so explicit that it is more than enough to show
    the establishment of the trust contended for by the Senior Debt Holders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Noteholders argue that the Indenture could have been amended without
    notice to or consent from the Senior Debt Holders and that this is inconsistent
    with Article 6.2(3) providing for the trust contended for by the Senior Debt
    Holders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    we disagree.  Not only has there been no such amendment, but Article 6.8
    of the Note Indenture provides that Stelco cannot act to impair any subrogation
    rights of the Senior Debt Holders.  Moreover, <i>Greenwood Shopping Plaza</i> makes
    clear that whether the parties can change the contractual terms creating
    the trust is but one test (although a common one) to determine whether a
    trust has been created.  As we have said, in this case, the language of Article
    6.2(3) is enough to make it crystal clear that that has happened.</p>

    because the Plan cancelled the Note Indenture on implementation, it necessarily
    cancelled the Turnover Provisions which were included in the Note Indenture.  Thus,
    the Senior Debt Holders are no longer entitled to enforce their subordination
    rights that are embodied in the Turnover Provisions.  </p>

    4.01 of the Plan provides for the cancellation on implementation of Stelco
    debentures which include the Note Indenture.  The relevant part of that Article
    reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A]ll debentures
    … subject to Section 6.01(2) will be cancelled and null and void, and all

    motion judge rejected the Noteholders’
    argument.  He held that section 6.01(2) of the Plan was the complete answer.  That
    section provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[N]othing in
    the wording of Section 6.01(1) or any other language in this Plan will bar
    or prejudice or be deemed to bar or prejudice the ability of any holder of
    Senior Debt (as defined in the Subordinated 2007 Bond Indenture) … to maintain
    or pursue claims or other remedies, including any third party beneficiary
    claims or remedies they may have, against holders of the [Notes].</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders argue that s. 6.01(2) does not preserve the substantive rights
    of Senior Debt Holders contained in the Turnover Provisions.  Rather, they
    say that the section provides only that the Plan would not preclude the Senior
    Debt Holders from advancing other claims not based on the Note Indenture
    or the Noteholders from raising defences to such claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not agree that s. 6.01(2) should be read in this manner.  We agree with
    the motion judge that the most reasonable interpretation of s. 6.01(2) is
    that implementation of the Plan would not affect the substantive rights and
    obligations of the Senior Debt Holders and the Noteholders in respect of
    the Turnover Provisions.  While the language of s. 6.01(2) does not explicitly
    refer to the Turnover Provisions, it does preserve
    “the ability of [Senior Debt Holders] to maintain or pursue claims or remedies,
    including any third party beneficiary claims or remedies, they may have against
    the [Noteholders]”.  The plain meaning of this language would protect all
    of the then-existing rights of the Senior Debt Holders against the Noteholders
    which unquestionably include the rights embodied in the Turnover Provisions.</p>

    there is nothing in the language of s. 6.01(2) or elsewhere in the Plan to
    suggest that the Senior Debt Holders intended to forego their rights of subordination
    found in the Turnover Provisions.  Indeed, there does not appear to be any
    commercial basis that would have led the Senior Debt Holders to vote in favour
    of a Plan that had the effect of removing the priority accorded to them by
    those provisions.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    read s. 6.01(2) as providing a method by which the parties could proceed
    with implementing the Plan without having to await the resolution of possible
    disputes between the Senior Debt Holders and the Noteholders with respect
    to the Turnover Provisions.  The potential delay in awaiting such a resolution
    could be lengthy, as the present litigation has shown, and possibly fatal
    to the implementation of the Plan.  From a commercial and practical standpoint,
    the approach adopted in s. 6.01(2) made a good deal of sense.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that this approach of delaying the resolution of inter-creditor disputes
    is not inconsistent with the scheme of the <i>CCAA</i>.  In a ruling made
    on November 10, 2005, in the proceedings relating to Stelco reported at 15
    C.B.R. (5th) 297, Farley J. expressed this point (at para. 7) as follows:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The <i>CCAA</i> is
    styled as “An Act to facilitate compromises and arrangements between companies
    and their creditors” and its short title is:  <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement
    Act</i>. Ss. 4, 5 and 6 talk of compromises or arrangements between a company
    and its creditors.  There is no mention of this extending by statute to encompass
    a change of relationship among the creditors <i>vis-à-vis</i> the creditors
    themselves and not directly involving the company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    we agree with the motion judge’s interpretation of s. 6.01(2).  The result
    of this interpretation is that the Plan extinguished the provisions of the
    Note Indenture respecting the rights and obligations as between Stelco and
    the Noteholders on the Effective Date.  However, the Turnover Provisions,
    which relate only to the rights and obligations between the Senior Debt Holders
    and the Noteholders, were intended to continue to operate.</p>
  <h2>(d)  Proof of Deficiencies</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders submit that the motion judge erred in failing to require each
    of the Senior Debt Holders to prove by evidence the amount of its actual
    Deficiency after receiving the distribution under the Plan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Note Indenture creates the Senior Debt Holders’ subrogated rights against
    the Noteholders.  Article 6.2, which is reproduced above, provides that in
    the event of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, the holders of all Senior
    Debt are entitled to be paid in full before the Noteholders are entitled
    to receive any payment or distribution.  It further provides that any payment
    or distribution made to the Noteholders will be paid to or held in trust
    for the Senior Debt Holders to the extent necessary to make payment of all
    Senior Debt remaining after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution
    to the Senior Debt Holders.  The Noteholders argue, therefore, that the motion
    judge should have required the Senior Debt Holders to prove the amount outstanding
    on their debts after receiving and disposing, if that is what occurred, of
    the Distributed Assets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    thrust of the Noteholders’ argument is that some Senior Debt Holders sold
    their securities in the new Stelco during the days or weeks immediately following
    the Effective Date at prices well in excess of the subscription price paid
    for those securities under the Plan.  Others who did not sell at the higher
    prices could have done so.  Thus the Noteholders argue the motion judge should
    have required each Senior Debt Holder to call evidence to prove its individual
    deficiency.  In effect, the Noteholders ask for an accounting by each Senior
    Debt Holder at some point after receipt of their securities in the new Stelco.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders argue that failure to call this type of evidence resulted in
    a failure to prove the individual claims of the Senior Debt Holders and for
    that reason the deficiency claims based on the subrogation right should have
    been dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge rejected this argument and proceeded by calculating the amount
    of the Deficiency on a collective rather than an individual basis.  The amount
    owing to the Senior Debt Holders before implementation of the Plan was not
    in dispute.  From this amount, the motion judge deducted the total amount
    of cash paid to the Senior Debt Holders together with the value he placed
    on the securities received by them as of the Effective Time.  Below, we deal
    with the issue of whether or not the motion judge erred in the way that he
    valued the Distributed Assets.  For present purposes, we need only concern
    ourselves with the general approach adopted by the motion judge, not the
    actual amounts resulting from that process.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the motion judge adopted the correct approach in calculating the
    Senior Debt Holders’ Deficiency.  It was not necessary for him to assess
    each claim on a collective, rather than an individual, basis.  Both the Note
    Indenture and the Debenture Indentures contemplate claims being made on a
    collective basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence about the amount owing to the Senior Debt Holders collectively was
    not in dispute, nor was the evidence about the distributions made to the
    Senior Debt Holders under the Plan.  The only question was what value should
    be attributed to the securities being received by the Senior Debt Holders
    on implementation.  The question was not:  What did the Senior Debt Holders
    do with the securities after implementation or what could they have done?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Article
    6.2(2) of the Note Indenture is clear that in the event of bankruptcy or
    insolvency proceedings, the Noteholders are required to make payment in full
    of the Senior Debt remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent
    payment or distribution to the Senior Debt Holders.  The exercise required
    under this provision is to look at the payment or distribution to the Senior
    Debt Holders in order to ascertain what remains unpaid.  To complete this
    exercise it was not necessary for the Senior Debt Holders to call evidence
    to establish what they did with the securities they received after implementation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    Senior Debt Holders assumed the market risks, benefits and burdens, after
    they received the securities.  The Noteholders are not entitled to benefit
    in market increases realized by the Senior Debt Holders after the implementation
    of the Plan.</p>

    we agree that the motion judge correctly proceeded with the Senior Debt Holders
    deficiency claim on a collective rather than individual basis.  We also agree
    that he did not err in not requiring the Senior Debt Holders to prove their
    individual claims by calling evidence about what securities were sold or
    at what prices securities could have been sold after implementation.</p>
  <h2>(e)  Post-Filing Interest</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders submit that the trial judge erred in concluding that the Senior
    Debt Holders were entitled to post-CCAA-filing interest on their outstanding
    amounts.  The Noteholders make two arguments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the Noteholders say that under the Plan, interest is only payable to creditors
    up to and including the filing date.  They base this argument on the definition
    of a claim in the Plan which is as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A]ny right of
    any Person against one or more of the Applicants in connection with any indebtedness,
    liability or obligation of any kind of any one or more of the Applicants
    in existence on the Filing Date and any interest thereon and costs payable
    in respect thereof to and include the Filing Date[.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders submit that any claim the Senior Debt Holders have for interest
    must be based on a “claim” they have against Stelco for such interest.  If
    the Senior Debt does not include post-filing interest, there can be no claim
    against the Noteholders for such amounts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept the Noteholders’ argument.  We note that the Debentures were
    not cancelled until the implementation of the Plan on March 31, 2006.  Section
    6.01(2) of the Plan specifically contemplates that the Senior Debt Holders
    will be able to claim interest against the Noteholders up to the point at
    which they are paid in full.  For convenience, we repeat the relevant language
    of s. 6.01(2) here:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he fact that
    the Plan provides that the calculation of the quantum of Claims and Affected
    Claim[s] is limited to principal, plus interest accrued to the Filing Date ….
    is not intended to bar or prejudice any entitlement of holders of Senior
    Debt (as defined in the Subordinated 2007 Bond Indenture) to make a claim
    for the full benefit for subordination against the holders of the Subordinated
    2007 Bonds and their trustee in respect of <i>all</i> amounts owing to them
    or that would have been owing to them had the CCAA Proceedings and the Plan
    never been implement, even amounts in excess of their Claims or Affected
    Claims for purposes of the Plan[.]  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, a fair reading of the Plan as a whole indicates that the definition
    of “claim” in the Plan was not intended to limit the Senior Debt Holders’ claims
    for interest on outstanding debt after the filing date.  The definition of
    a claim relied upon by the Noteholders was intended only to form the basis
    upon which the amounts of claims against the company can be fixed for voting
    purposes in order to allow the company’s affairs to be administered in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question then becomes whether the Debentures provide that interest would
    accrue after the institution of the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.  We are satisfied
    that they do.  The Debentures specify that Stelco would pay principal and
    interest accrued thereon, including in the case of default, interest on the
    amount of the default, so long as any Debentures remain outstanding.  The
    Debentures remained outstanding after the filing in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings
    until the Plan was implemented on March 31, 2006.  Clearly, the Debentures
    contemplated that interest would continue to accrue post-filing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    nothing in the Note Indenture limits the Senior Debt Holders’ entitlement
    to interest as of filing under a <i>CCAA</i> Plan.  Parties to the Note Indenture
    expressly addressed the possibility of the insolvency of Stelco and established
    the Turnover Proceeds process.  In doing so, the Note Indenture did not limit
    the Senior Debt Holders to pre-filing interest claims.  On the contrary,
    the Noteholders agreed that they would not receive any payment from Stelco
    until after all Senior Debt had been paid in full.  Senior Debt was defined
    as “the principal of the premium (if any) and interest …”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    we do not accept the Noteholders’ argument that the Plan limited the Senior
    Debt Holders’ claim to pre-filing interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders’ second argument is that the Senior Debt Holders are not entitled
    to post-filing interest because of an
    “Interest Stops Rule”.  According to this argument, interest would only be
    paid up to the filing date in all bankruptcy, winding up and related proceedings,
    including restructurings under the <i>CCAA</i>.  The policy reasons for the
    rule are that one creditor’s <i>pro rata</i> share of the debtor’s filings
    should not increase faster than another’s and also that claims in a <i>CCAA</i> proceeding
    should be fixed and not subject to continual recalculation for interest.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders point out that the <i>CCAA</i> defines a claim as “any indebtedness,
    liability or obligation of any kind that, if unsecured, would be a debt provable
    in bankruptcy within the meaning of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>.”  Post-filing
    interest cannot be claimed under the <i>BIA</i>.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    start, there is no persuasive authority that supports an Interest Stops Rule
    in a <i>CCAA</i> proceeding.  Indeed, the suggested rule is inconsistent
    with the comment of Justice Binnie in <i>Re Canada 3000 Inc.</i>, [2006]
    1 S.C.R. 865 at para. 96, where he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>While a <i>CCAA</i> filing
    does not stop the accrual of interest, the unpaid charges remain an unsecured
    claim provable against the bankrupt airline.  The claim does not accrue interest

    Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Binnie’s comment highlights the point that not all companies emerge from <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.  Some
    are converted into <i>BIA</i> proceedings.  When that happens, claims under
    the <i>BIA</i> include interest up to the date of the bankruptcy and, therefore,
    could include claims after a <i>CCAA</i> filing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the definition of claim in the <i>CCAA</i> is not intended to limit
    payments to creditors.  Indeed, the Noteholders accept that Plans can and
    sometimes do provide for payments in excess of claims filed in the <i>CCAA</i> proceeding.  That
    fact argues against an interpretation of the definition of a claim in the <i>CCAA</i> that
    would limit payments to the creditors.</p>

    date in order to crystallize a point in time at which claims against the
    company can be fixed for voting purposes in order that the estate may be
    administered.  It has nothing to do with the amount of payments to the creditors.  As
    we set out above, s. 6.01(2) of the Stelco Plan contemplated the continuation
    of accrual of interest to the Senior Debt Holders after the <i>CCAA</i> filing

    course of business goes beyond transactions with trade creditors. The reference
    to “ <i>business, property, </i>services<i> or other assets</i>” (emphasis

    of businesses or assets.  The reference to the acquisition of services, while
    included in the list, is secondary and suggests that it was included to reflect
    the possibility that an acquisition could include a service component, rather
    than the possibility of a ‘services only’ transaction.  This reading of the
    definition of an ordinary course transaction suggests that the intention
    was to narrow transactions that qualified as non-ordinary course transactions
    to those that are material to Stelco in terms of both the amount of the indebtedness
    incurred or assumed and in terms of their impact on Stelco’s business and
    operations.  Accordingly, I think the clause implicitly requires demonstration
    that the acquisition will have the effect of significantly changing the nature
    of the business conducted, being the goods and services produced and sold,
    the scale of operations, the manner of manufacturing or distributing the
    products sold by Stelco, or the anticipated financial results of Stelco.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While I do not
    think that the clause contemplates transactions in which services are the
    principal subject matter, I accept, however, that such acquisitions could
    qualify as Senior Debt if it can be demonstrated that the transaction will
    have an effect on Stelco that is described by the test set out above.  In
    particular, if a service contract, for which the most obvious candidate would
    be an outsourcing contract such as the MITSA, materially changes the manner
    in which Stelco manufactures or distributes its products, or its financial
    prospects, the contract can be said to envisage a transaction that is analogous
    to a non-ordinary course acquisition of a business, property or assets. </p>

    motion judge then went on to find that the MITSA did not satisfy his test
    for essentially three reasons.  First, he concluded that the transaction
    contemplated by the MITSA “will not significantly change the nature of Stelco’s
    business or the scale of its operations.  Nor will its change either the
    products manufactured and sold by Stelco over this period or Stelco’s manufacturing
    or distribution activities”.  Secondly, he found it necessary to separate
    the components of the MITSA into its “ordinary course elements” and its
    “non-ordinary elements”, and he decided that the former outweighed the latter.  Finally,
    while the total fees anticipated over the ten-year term of the MITSA were “undoubtedly
    significant”, the motion judge found that the annual expenditures involved
    were not materially greater than those under other outsourcing arrangements
    Stelco had entered into and that there was “no evidence that the transaction
    contemplated by the MITSA was material to the projected annual financial
    performance of Stelco”.</p>

    Debentureholders and Noteholders stress that this court has emphasized on
    a number of occasions that Commercial List judges, particularly those supervising
    a <i>CCAA</i> proceeding, are entitled to considerable deference: see <i>Stelco
    Inc. (Re)</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 5 (C.A.) at para. 63; <i>Stelco Inc. (Re) </i>(2006),

    ) at 160; and <i>BNY Capital Corp. v. Katotakis</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 623
    (C.A.) at para. 8.  They also submit that a determination of whether a transaction
    falls within “the ordinary course of business” of an enterprise is an issue
    of fact: see <i>McDonic v. Hetherington (Litigations Guardian of)</i> (1997),
    31 O.R. (3d) 577 (

    (H.C.J.) at 750.  Accordingly, they argue that we should not interfere with
    the findings of the motion judge – an experienced Commercial List judge interpreting
    a commercial contract – as he made no palpable and overriding error and is
    entitled to deference.  </p>

    whether a transaction occurs in the ordinary course of business entails more
    than simply the finding of facts and the drawing of inferences from those
    facts, although the fact finding exercise is clearly a central part of the
    process. “Ordinary course of business” is a legal notion and the decision
    as to whether a certain set of facts falls within that category, or does
    not, has generally been arrived at by courts through an examination of various
    factors associated with the notion – about which we will have more to say
    later.  In this sense, we prefer the approach taken by the Alberta Court
    of Appeal in <i>Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Holdings Inc</i>. (2000), 271
    A.R. 280 (C.A.), namely that such a determination is a question of mixed
    fact and law.  As Fruman J.A. noted at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While a reviewing
    court will defer to a trial judge’s fact findings, a determination that a
    transaction was in the ordinary course of a company’s business is a mixed

    constitutes reviewable error.   </p>

    do not read Justice Doherty’s comments in <i>McDonic Estate, supra</i>, to
    mandate any different conclusion.  There, the court was dealing with whether
    a law firm was vicariously liable for the actions of a partner who had invested
    funds deposited in the firm’s trust account on behalf of the plaintiffs.  The
    answer depended on whether the partner’s actions fell within the scope of
    his implied authority, which they did if they fell within the ordinary course
    of business of the law firm.  The meaning of the legal norm was not in issue.  Doherty
    J.A. observed that the question was a factual one – without focusing on whether
    it was a question of fact alone or of mixed fact and law – and noted that
    the trial judge’s finding that the partner’s activities did not fall within
    the scope of the firm’s ordinary course of business “must stand unless tainted
    by an error of law, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or a failure
    to consider relevant evidence”.  This conclusion is not inconsistent with
    the approach taken by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>Gainers.</i></p>

    that, although the findings of a judge of first instance on issues of mixed
    fact and law will generally be entitled to deference on the “palpable and
    overriding error”
    standard, where the judge has erred in applying a “readily extricable” legal
    principle in making those findings the review will be conducted in accordance
    with a less stringent standard.  A failure to consider appropriate factors
    or an error in determining the factors to be applied will fall into this

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    his approach to the resolution of the ordinary course of business issue was
    grounded in his view that the concept of an “ordinary course” acquisition
    in the definition of Senior Debt in the Note Indenture should be interpreted
    broadly and that of a “non-ordinary course”
    acquisition, narrowly.  This approach was driven by his view of the terms
    of the Note Indenture, particularly the definition of “Senior Debt” and his
    perception that the reference to the acquisition of “services” in the definition
    was secondary – included “to reflect the possibility that an acquisition
    could include a service component, rather than the possibility of a ‘services
    only’ transaction.”  We do not understand why, as the motion judge said (reasons,
    para. 157), “the reference to ‘<i>business, property, </i>services <i>or
    other assets</i>’ [emphasis added by the motion judge] suggests that the
    principal focus of the clause is the acquisition of businesses [the first
    item mentioned] or assets [the last mentioned]” rather than on “services” (the
    third item mentioned).  We can see no basis for singling out “services” from
    the list and assigning it a lower level of significance. These are not matters
    of fact; they are matters of contractual interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly,
    while the motion judge acknowledged, and found, that the MITSA transaction “was
    a <i>unique</i> outsourcing transaction” and that it “was both <i>comprehensive</i> in
    terms of the scope of Stelco’s IT requirements” and also “<i>significant</i> to
    Stelco, because a failure by EDS to perform adequately would be costly”
    [emphasis added], he gave these important factors little, if any, consideration
    in making his ordinary course of business determination.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thirdly,
    in establishing the criteria that he did for resolving the issue, he set
    the bar so high that a non-ordinary course of business acquisition in relation
    to services is practically impossible.  This stems, at least in part, from
    his conclusion that an acquisition in relation to “services” does not rank
    at the same level as other types of acquisitions.  On our reading of the
    Note Indenture, this interpretation is inconsistent with the intention of
    the parties to it.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the motion judge erred, in our view, by entirely discarding the factors taken
    into account in the existing jurisprudence concerning what may constitute
    a transaction out of the ordinary course of business.  He did so on the basis
    that the cases relied upon by 2074600 “dealt with the disposition of assets,
    rather than acquisitions, in circumstances in which the applicable covenant
    or legislation is directed toward fair treatment of, or protection of, creditors”,
    and that “[t]hey do not deal with the concept of non-ordinary course transactions
    involving the purchase of assets or services by a solvent company”.  The
    cases referred to are <i>Pacific

    Mobile, supra</i> (a fraudulent preference case); <i>Roynat Inc. v. Ron Clark

    we do not understand the significance of the distinction drawn by the motion
    judge between circumstances involving the disposition of assets and those
    involving acquisitions for these purposes.  When the Supreme Court of Canada
    observed that it is unwise “to give a comprehensive definition of the term
    ‘ordinary course of business’ for all transactions” (<i>Pacific Mobile</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    291), the court did not mean that there were no recognizable indicia or factors
    to be considered; it simply meant that no single criterion or set of criteria
    was suitable for all cases.  While there may be different considerations
    in situations involving fraudulent preferences, bulk sales transactions,
    tax cases or dissenting shareholders’ rights cases, the factors taken into
    account by the courts in such circumstances may nonetheless be of assistance
    here because they help shed light on what courts have looked to in various
    contexts in order to decide whether a transaction is one that is in the ordinary
    course of business.  </p>

    that regard, we start with the observation that the intention of the Note
    Indenture is clear:  the Noteholders’ claims are to be subordinated to <i>all</i> Senior
    Debt, as defined in the Indenture.  Article 2.9 (Rank and Subordination)
    provides that “payment of the principal of and interest on the Debentures
    is expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full of Senior Debt, as
    provided in Article 6.”  Article 6 (Subordination of Debentures) opens with
    the declaration in 6.1 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Stelco] covenants
    and agrees, and each [Noteholder], by his acceptance thereof, likewise agrees,
    that the payment of the principal of and of any interest on the Debentures
    is hereby <i>expressly subordinated</i>, to the extent and in the manner
    hereinafter set forth, in right of payment <i>to the prior payment in full
    of <u>all</u> Senior Debt whether outstanding on the date of this First Supplemental
    Indenture or thereafter incurred</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    definition of “Senior Debt” is cited above.  In substance, it encompasses
    all borrowings of a general nature and all borrowings for purposes of acquisitions
    (except acquisitions in the ordinary course of business), together with the
    refinancing of such borrowings.  In our opinion, this concept of Senior Debt
    is quite broad and is intended to be so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we see no reason why ordinary course acquisitions should be viewed broadly
    and non-ordinary course acquisitions addressed narrowly.  Having regard to
    the purpose of Article 6.1 of the Note Indenture and the definition of Senior
    Debt, we think the contrary is the case.  The purpose and intent of the Indenture
    was to ensure that creditors providing financing to Stelco, other than ordinary
    course of business creditors, would have priority over the Noteholders, who
    accepted that they were taking subject to such “Senior Debt”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    does not advance the case to argue – as the Debentureholders do – that because
    of the impact on other creditors’ rights (namely, those of the Noteholders)
    the concept of non-ordinary course transactions should be interpreted narrowly
    and ordinary course transactions broadly.  The only issue here is what
    “creditors’ rights” are to be affected?  We can see no basis for interpreting
    the Note Indenture in favour of one group of creditors over another simply
    because of what group they fall into.  A reading of the definition of Senior
    Debt supports the view that debtholders who were creditors for “moneys borrowed” by
    Stelco – whether it be free-standing borrowing or indebtedness incurred in
    connection with the acquisition  of  business, property, <i>services</i> or
    assets – were to have priority over the Noteholders.  The only exceptions
    were ordinary course of business acquisitions.  Given this scheme, it is
    the exception that ought to be construed narrowly, not the principal provision.</p>

    motion judge’s opinion that the factors considered by other courts to be
    pertinent to the determination of what constitutes a transaction in the ordinary
    course of business, together with his view that non-ordinary course transactions
    should be narrowly construed in the circumstances of this case, led him to
    postulate his own test.  In doing so, he set the bar very high.  To qualify
    as a transaction out of the ordinary course of business, he concluded that
    an acquisition must have the effect of <i>significantly changing</i> either
    (a) the nature of the business conducted by Stelco (the goods and services
    it produced or sold, the scale of its operations, the manner of manufacturing
    or distributing the products it sold) and/or (b) the financial results of
    Stelco. </p>

    of none.  Undoubtedly, an acquisition that met those criteria would be a
    non-ordinary course of business transaction, but we do not read anything
    in the Note Indenture or in the jurisprudence that requires a transaction
    that is out of the ordinary course of business to be of such a corporate
    landscape-changing nature.  </p>

    however, he weighed those that he did consider against what we take to be
    an unsuitably high standard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the transaction envisaged in the MITSA was not a transaction in
    the ordinary course of Stelco’s business.  We say that having regard particularly
    to a number of factors and characteristics.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    as the motion judge found, the MITSA was a uniquely comprehensive and significant
    transaction for Stelco.  The evidence was that no outsourcing transaction
    in Stelco’s history was comparable to it.  It contemplated a total amount
    payable by Stelco over its ten-year term of more than $320 million.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    MITSA involved the total transition of Stelco’s IT assets and virtually all
    business applications and IT employees from Stelco to EDS and the complete
    transfer from Stelco to EDS of all responsibility for Stelco’s IT needs.  As
    well as providing for the transfer of IT assets from Stelco to EDS and from
    EDS to Stelco, and for the provision of all services in relation to Stelco’s
    IT needs, the MITSA provided for the integration, through a series of enterprise
    resource planning systems (“ERPs”), of all aspects of Stelco’s business from
    procurement or materials to shipping of finished products.  The ERPs consisted
    of three projects: (i) a synchronous manufacturing system, (ii) an asset
    management system, and (iii) human resources and financial management systems.  The
    effect was to overhaul and change completely Stelco’s manufacturing, asset
    management, human resource and financial management systems.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Mr. Steiner put it in his factum and in oral argument on behalf of 2074600: “If
    this extraordinary contract for services … is not out of the ordinary course
    of business for Stelco, what possible contract for services could be?”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the MITSA was a one-time transaction – isolated, unusual, and far from routine
    in the course of Stelco’s business.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the MITSA was the subject of a special public announcement by Stelco.  The
    Debentureholders and the Noteholders argue that it is the content – or, rather,
    what is missing in the content – of the press release that is significant,
    not the public announcement itself.  They say this because the press release
    made no specific mention of the fact that the MITSA indebtedness would constitute
    Senior Debt and therefore the market could not be expected to react on the
    basis that it did.  In our view, however, the significant point is that Stelco
    felt the transaction was sufficiently important and unusual that public disclosure
    was necessary, a step the company rarely took when entering into a procurement
    contract.  Stelco’s indebtedness with regard to the MITSA was treated as
    long-term indebtedness, and was specifically mentioned on its financial statements.  In
    short, the transaction – to adopt the language of <i>Aubrett Holdings, supra</i> – was
    not treated as one “calling for no remark”.  It received special notice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    the MITSA entailed complex provisions relating to financing that were unusual
    to Stelco and to EDS.  Because the material and evidence filed on this issue
    contains confidential information and has been ordered sealed, no more need
    be said about it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the transaction was not one that could be carried out on management’s own
    initiative.  It required, and received, approval from Stelco’s board of directors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that others in the steel industry may be outsourcing their IT needs
    as well, and the fact that Stelco engaged in other outsourcing transactions
    itself, are indicative of the increasing popularity of this particular practice,
    but they are not dispositive of whether the transaction envisaged in the
    MITSA is an ordinary course of business transaction for Stelco.  In the end,
    the transaction provided for in the MITSA involved a fundamental change to
    the way in which Stelco carried on its integral IT operations – and through
    that, its manufacturing operations –
    at a cost and in a fashion that was considered sufficiently significant to
    call for public disclosure, and which required and received board of director
    approval.  It was characterized by unusual and complex financial arrangements.  Even
    if the motion judge were correct in his conclusion that the MITSA did not
    effect a significant change in the nature of the business Stelco conducted – it
    continued to manufacture and distribute steel products – the transaction
    was not “one of the ordinary day to day business activities, having no unusual
    features” (<i>Re Bradford Roofing</i>), or “part of the undistinguished flow
    of business carried on, calling for no remark” (<i>Aubrett Holdings</i>,
    as adopted in <i>Gainers</i>).  It did not transpire “as a matter of normal
    and incidental daily customs and practices in business” (<i>Black’s</i> <i>Law
    Dictionary</i>).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    property, services and assets provided for in the MITSA were not acquisitions
    made in the ordinary course of Stelco’s business.  Accordingly, the indebtedness
    incurred by Stelco to EDS (and therefore to 2074600, as assignee of EDS)
    constitutes
    “Senior Debt” within the meaning of the Note Indenture.</p>

  <h2>IV.  The Debentureholders’ Appeal (C46266)</h2>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(a)  Overview</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Debentureholders and the Noteholders disagree on the value of the Distributed
    Assets. This has an effect on the value of the Deficiency (if any), which
    in turn determines how the Turnover Proceeds will be distributed amongst
    the parties. The Debentureholders assign a lower value to the Distributed
    Assets ($217,215,846) compared to the Noteholders’ valuation ($294,497,863).
    This means that by the Debentureholders’ calculation, the Deficiency is $125,439,818
    whereas the Noteholders calculate the Deficiency to be much lower ($48,157,801).</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b)  The Source of the Disagreement</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Debentureholders adduced evidence from different sources that supported a
    finding that the value of the New Common Shares on the Effective Date was
    $5.50 per share. They also argued that the New FRNs should be valued at par
    (face value) and that the New Warrants should be valued at $1.44 per warrant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Noteholders did not adduce conflicting evidence regarding the value of the
    shares on the Effective Date; instead, they adduced evidence by way of a
    report prepared by a derivatives expert who assigned a value to the Distributed
    Assets based on the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the securities
    during the first week of trading, beginning on April 3, 2006. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(c)  The Motion Judge’s Reasons</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge used a third set of figures and his own methodology to arrive
    at a different set of valuations.  He did not agree with either party’s position
    on valuation. He held that “value” means
    “the price for the securities that the Senior Debt Holders could have received
    if they had sold their securities in an open market at the Effective Time
    on March 31, 2006.”  The motion judge also held that the definitions of “fair
    market value”, “fair value”, and “intrinsic value” were not helpful to determine
    the definition of “value” to the extent that those terms mean “something
    other than the price of the securities in an open market”, because the issue
    was not whether the Debentureholders had received “fair” value, but rather
    what value should be ascribed to the assets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge rejected the parties’ positions on the grounds that neither
    method of valuation was an appropriate reflection of the value of the securities
    on the Effective Date. He then determined that the best evidence of the value
    of the Distributed Assets was the VWAP from the first trading day after the
    Effective Date.  In the case of the New Common Shares and the New Warrants,
    the first day of trading was April 3, 2006; for the new FRNS, the first trading
    day was April 5, 2006.  The motion judge did not take into account block
    discounts or a lack of liquidity in the marketplace to alter those values.  He
    valued the Distributed Assets at a total of $276,487,090, leaving a Deficiency
    of $66,168,574. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    the Debentureholders and 2074600 appeal the motion judge’s reasons with respect
    to his valuation methodology.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(d)  Analysis</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    central issue on this appeal relates to the price to be attributed to the
    securities distributed by Stelco – in particular, the price of its New Common
    Shares – as part of the compromise of its debt.  The issue arises because
    of the Subordinated Noteholders’ obligation under the Note Indenture to make
    the Senior Debt Holders whole out of any proceeds they (the Notheholders)
    receive in an insolvency or reorganization.  Only after the Senior Debt Holders
    have been paid in full are the Noteholders entitled to recover on their own
    account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Articles
    2.9, 6.1 and 6.2 of the Note Indenture, which are cited in full elsewhere
    in these reasons, set out these obligations on the part of the Noteholders.  For
    present purposes, the provisions that are most relevant are those set out
    in section 6.2(3)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> which states that in the event of the insolvency
    or reorganization of Stelco, any payments received from Stelco by the Noteholders
    or the Trustee, whether in cash, property or securities, before the Senior
    Debt is paid in full, are to be held in trust,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>and will be
    paid over to the holders of such Senior Debt … for application to the payment
    of all Senior Debt remaining <i>until such Senior Debt has been paid in full,
    after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision
    therefore) to the holders of such Senior Debt.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute about the amount of the Senior Debt remaining unpaid as at
    the Effective Date ($342,655,664 plus the EDS Claim of $48,994,917).  Thus,
    the central issue for determination is how to “[give] effect to any concurrent
    payment or distribution … to the holders of [the] Senior Debt” in order to
    determine whether the Senior Debt Holders had been “paid in full” and, if
    not, the extent of the Deficiency to be made up through the Turnover Proceeds
    (“the Deficiency Claim”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    is not the question the motion judge posed for himself, however.  Both the
    Debentureholders and 2074600 argued that the New Common Shares and the New
    Warrants should be valued using the $5.50 subscription price for the New
    Common Shares under the Plan.  The motion judge rejected this approach.  Instead,
    he focused on the public markets and sought to determine what the “market
    value” was of Stelco’s New Common Shares received in the distribution, as
    closely as that value could be determined to the Effective Time under the
    Plan. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras. 105 and 106 of his Reasons he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue before
    the Court can therefore be put simply: did the Senior Debt Holders receive
    Distributions on the Plan Implementation Date having a value that constituted
    “payment in full” of their claims and, if not, what is the extent of their
    deficiency?  For this purpose, <i>the Court must determine the value of the
    payments received</i> by the Senior Debt Holders.  For the reasons set out
    above, I have concluded that the payments were received by the Senior Debt
    Holders at the Effective Time on March 31, 2006 and must be valued as of
    that time.  There is, however, <i>no provision in either the Note Indenture
    or the Plan that specifically addresses the proper approach to the valuations</i> of
    the property received in reorganization.  Accordingly, the issue for the
    Court is the most appropriate evidence of the value of the Distributions
    received by the Senior Debt Holders on March 31, 2006.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Court is
    not, of course, to conduct its own inquiry into the value of the securities.  The
    Court must determine, instead, the best evidence of the value of the Distributions
    based on the evidence before it.  <i>For this purpose, I am of the opinion
    that “value” means the price for the securities that the Senior Debt Holders
    could have received if they had sold their securities in an open market at
    the Effective Time on March 31, 2006</i>.  This reflects the fact that, at
    that time, the Senior Debt Holders were in a position to realize the values
    of the securities paid to them by selling them in the market.  <i>Accordingly,
    the Court must determine the market price paid for the securities at the
    Effective Time</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>Later, the motion judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue for
    the Court is the determination of the prices that the Senior Debt Holders
    could have obtained for their securities if it had been possible to trade
    the securities at the Effective Time on the Plan Implementation Date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully,
    however, the issue for the Court to determine was not the price the Senior
    Debt Holders could have obtained had they been able to trade their new securities
    at 11:59 p.m. on March 31, 2006 – their “market value” at that time.  The
    issue was how to determine the
    “concurrent payment or distribution” received from Stelco by the Senior Debt
    Holders at the time of Stelco’s emergence from <i>CCAA</i> protection at
    11:59 p.m. on that date, and how to give effect to that concurrent payment
    or distribution for purposes of resolving whether the Senior Debt Holders
    had been paid in full, in the context of the Note Indenture and the Plan
    documents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    interpret how to give effect to the payment received by the Senior Debt Holders
    “concurrently” – that is, concurrently with the payments received by, or
    on behalf of, the Noteholders in the <i>CCAA</i> insolvency proceedings – it
    is necessary to construe the provisions of the Note Indenture in the context
    of the language of the Plan itself and the negotiations leading up to its
    approval by the stakeholders and sanction by the Court.  That is the factual
    matrix within which the meaning of this contract must be determined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What,
    then, was the concurrent payment or distribution received by the Senior Debt
    Holders in exchange for the compromise of their claims on the emergence of
    Stelco from <i>CCAA</i> protection?  The answer to that question is found
    in Article 2.03 of the Plan.  What the Affected Creditors under the Plan – the
    Senior Debt Holders and the Noteholders included – received was their <i>pro
    rata</i> share of each of:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    argument on the appeal focused on the Senior Debt Holders’ <i>pro rata</i> share
    of (b) and (c) above.  The creditors were to receive a block of New Common
    Shares of Stelco as part of the compromise of their debt; they were prepared
    to invest and to take an equity position in the new Stelco to the extent
    of 1.1 million shares.  They were also to receive a pool of cash which was
    to vary between $137.5 million and $108.5 million, depending upon the number
    of shares creditors elected to take up pursuant to Section 2.07 of the Plan,
    referenced in the caveat to (b) above.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    2.07 is the “Share Election” provision in the Plan.  It does two things.  First,
    it permits each Affected Creditor to
    “elect to receive all or any part of its distribution from the Cash Pool
    in New Common Shares at $5.50 per share”,<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a> thus providing an opportunity for electing Affected
    Creditors to take a further risk, in effect by engaging in a new transaction
    and investing part of their cash proceeds in the future of the new Stelco.  Second – and
    significantly from the perspective of resolving what the concurrent payment
    or distribution received by the Senior Debt Holders was –
    Section 2.07 makes it clear that the size of the Cash Pool to be received
    on distribution is to be reduced by $5.50 for each New Common Share that
    is elected to be taken.  Hence, the amount of cash that Stelco would be required
    to pay to exit from the <i>CCAA</i> process varied in the range referred
    to above, depending upon the number of New Common Shares the creditors elected
    to acquire.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of this gives rise to the following questions.  Viewed in the context of
    the Plan documentation and the negotiated compromise of the creditors’ claims
    against Stelco, how should the words “give effect to any concurrent payment
    or distribution to the holders of such Senior Debt” in Articles 6.2(2) and
    (3) of the Note Indenture be interpreted?  Leaving aside the FRNs and Warrants,
    was it the “concurrent payment or distribution” of cash and a bundle of $5.50
    New Common Shares?  Or was it the combination of cash and a bundle of shares
    distributed at the price they would fetch in the open market once trading
    commenced?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    are not questions of fact.  They are questions of interpretation of the Note
    Indenture and the Plan documentation.  Importantly, these questions focus
    on the proper approach to “giving effect to” the distribution of securities
    to the Senior Debt Holders as part of the reorganization.  The motion judge’s
    decision is therefore entitled to less deference on appeal than would be
    the case if what was at issue were simply a question of fact or of inferences
    drawn from the facts.  See paragraph 83 above, and <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>,

    our opinion – although the motion judge was correct in observing that marketable
    securities are normally valued on the basis of what they will bring in the

    “plan value” approach urged upon him by the Debentureholders and 2074600
    in the circumstances of this case.  By doing so, he lost sight of the real
    issue for determination which, as mentioned above, is how to give effect
    to the concurrent payments or distribution received by the Senior Debt Holders
    in order to establish the extent of the Deficiency Claim.  “Plan value” as
    opposed to
    “market value” is the touchstone for resolving that issue.  Once this is
    recognized, much of the force in the motion judge’s reasons for dismissing
    the criteria urged on him by the Debentureholders and 2074600 dissipates.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a proper interpretation of Article 6 of the Note Indenture, in the context
    of the Plan documentation, what was paid or distributed by Stelco to the
    Senior Debt Holders and Noteholders pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Plan – leaving
    aside again the FRNs and the Warrants – was cash together with $5.50 New
    Common Shares (either as part of the Share Elect component or as part of
    the general New Common Share component of the payment or distribution to
    Affected Creditors).  We say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    it makes sense that the “concurrent payment or distribution” to the Senior
    Debt Holders under the Note Indenture be determined by the Plan documents,
    since the Stelco reorganization is the source of the payment or distribution
    in question.  The indicia of distribution price in the Plan documents point
    to $5.50 per share.<a href="#_ftn6"

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significantly,
    the Equity Sponsors under the Plan received 19,737,000 New Common Shares
    in exchange for their infusion of $108.5 million ($5.50 per share). 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise and Appaloosa – the two Noteholders leading this appeal – are two
    of the three Equity Sponsors.  Each contributed approximately $27 million
    to acquire their roughly 4,950,000 shares at that price.  Equally significantly,
    Senior Debt Holders and Noteholders who elected to take shares pursuant to
    Section 2.07 of the Plan (the “Share Elects”) did so on the basis of accepting
    one New Common Share in lieu of $5.50 of their <i>pro rata</i> share of the
    Cash Pool.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly,
    other indicia point in the same direction.  For instance, Stelco itself publicly
    valued the New Common Shares issued at $5.50 per share “upon its emergence
    from <i>CCAA</i>”: see Stelco’s First Quarterly Report, March 2006, at p.
    15.  In addition, Stelco’s board of directors approved a compensation package
    for its incoming CEO on the Effective Date.  This package included a grant
    of 1 million New Common Shares at a price of $5.50 per share and a grant
    of options to acquire an additional 1,044,000 New Common Shares at a strike
    price of $5.50 per share.  This transaction was consummated at the Effective
    Time as well and could not have taken place without the approval of the TSX,
    which was obtained.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the Amended Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Equity Sponsors (including
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sunrise and Appaloosa) agreed (a) to inject new capital into Stelco in exchange
    for New Common Shares at a rate of $5.50 per share, and (b) to purchase any
    shares left over from the Share Election process at a price of $5.50.  They
    also had a right to purchase any New Common Shares that a subscriber failed
    to purchase at the Effective Time for the same price.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is apparent from the foregoing that the deal which was struck as a result
    of the negotiations leading up to the Plan and the acceptance and sanctioning
    of the Plan contemplated the distribution of $5.50 New Common Shares at the
    Effective Time.  The Noteholders, as well as the Senior Debt Holders, were
    integrally involved in what Farley J. referred to at the Sanction Hearing
    as the “direct protracted negotiations” and “hard bargaining” of sophisticated
    parties,<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a> and voted in favour of the Plan.  In short, everyone
    knew, understood, and had agreed, that this was to be the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    notion of the “Effective Time” (11:59 p.m. on the Effective Date) is important.  The
    entitlement of the Senior Debt Holders and the Noteholders to the payment
    or distribution only arises at that moment, which is when their claims are
    compromised and their debentures (subject to the Turnover Proceeds dispute)
    are cancelled.  All other transactions relating to the emergence of Stelco
    from its insolvent state occur at, or as close as possible to, that moment
    as well.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note this because, in rejecting the “Plan value” approach, the motion judge
    placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the $5.50 price was negotiated
    at the time of the creditors’ acceptance of the Plan in December 2005, and
    therefore was not necessarily an accurate benchmark of the value of the shares
    on March 31, 2006.  Similarly, the share election under Section 2.07 had
    to be made by January 20, 2006.  These factors are of little import in assessing
    the payment or distribution received by the Senior Debt Holders at the Effective
    Time, however.  Those creditors who elected to exercise their option under
    Section 2.07 and take shares in lieu of $5.50 in cash (“the Share Elect Creditors”),
    were not entitled to receive and did not have the right to receive those
    shares prior to the Effective Time.  Though these decisions were made prior
    to the Effective Time, they were made with a view to what everyone agreed
    was the price of the New Common Shares at the Effective Time.  The same is
    true of others who acquired New Common Shares as part of the reorganization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stelco
    distributed its New Common Shares to the Equity Sponsors, the Share Elect
    Creditors (also including many Noteholders) and its new CEO at a price of
    $5.50 per share, effective 11:59 p.m. on March 31, 2006.  The Equity Sponsors,
    Share Elect Creditors and the new CEO purchased the shares for that amount
    at the same time.  It makes no sense to say that Share Elect Creditors received
    those shares – at the same time and for purposes of compromising their claims – at
    some different distribution price (the average market price three days later),
    all as part of the same reorganization process.  Nor does it make any sense
    to differentiate between the distribution price of the Share Elect shares
    and that of the 1.1 million New Common Shares that were distributed generally
    as part of the payment to Affected Creditors.  If all other New Common Shares
    that were being sold and acquired as part of the reorganization at the same
    Effective Time were being distributed at $5.50 per share, why would the New
    Common Share component of the payment to Senior Debt Holders and the other
    Affected Creditors be distributed at any other price?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of these factors – the provisions of Section 2.03 of the Plan itself; the
    robust negotiations leading up to acceptance of the Plan; the $5.50 price
    paid at 11:59 p.m. on the Effective Date by the Senior Debt Holders, the
    Noteholders and the Equity Sponsors for their New Common Shares, and the
    price at which the New Common Shares and the options were issued to the new
    CEO at the same time –
    demonstrate clearly that the price which was accepted and agreed to by everyone
    involved in the reorganization for purposes of Stelco’s payment or distribution
    upon emerging from the <i>CCAA</i> process was $5.50 per share.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was the payment or distribution price for purposes of “[giving] effect to
    [the] concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of [the] Senior Debt” called
    for in section 6.2(3) of the Note Indenture.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the foregoing interpretation makes commercial sense.  Stelco and the Affected
    Creditors – including the Senior Debt Holders and the Noteholders – needed
    certainty in order to make the reorganization work.  Stelco needed to know,
    with as much certainty as possible, how much it was going to have to pay
    to compromise its debt and emerge from the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings to start
    afresh.  The Senior Debt Holders and Noteholders needed to know, again with
    as much accuracy as possible, how much they were going to be paid on account
    of their claims in order to decide whether to vote in favour of, or against,
    the Plan.  These goals could not be achieved through an interpretation of
    the language in the Noteholders Indenture that would leave the quantum of
    the “concurrent payment or distribution” received by the Senior Debt Holders
    to the vagaries of the market after the distribution was completed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the Affected Creditors as a whole were prepared to assume the risk of a relatively
    minor equity investment in the new Stelco – 1.1 million New Common Shares – as
    part of the price of arriving at a resolution of their claims – the Share
    Election provisions of Section 2.07 of the Plan provided a different opportunity.  They
    gave creditors who were prepared to take the risk of a successful Stelco
    recovery a further opening to invest in that recovery by purchasing additional
    New Common Shares in what was, in effect, a second transaction following
    the distribution.  The fact that Section 5.04 of the Plan notionally treats
    the subscriptions for shares pursuant to the Share Election under Section
    2.07 as having occurred <i>after</i> the distributions to the Affected Creditors,
    lends support to this “second transaction” concept.  For purposes of establishing
    the extent of the Deficiency Claim, what is distributed to the Senior Debt
    Holders as the Cash Pool is either cash or the share equivalent of $5.50
    in cash.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the foregoing analysis is limited to the Share Election shares, there is
    nothing in the Plan documentation or in the circumstances surrounding the
    reorganization – as we have mentioned above – to suggest that the New Common
    Shares as a whole should be treated on any different basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal must therefore be allowed in this regard and the order of the motion
    judge dated October 31, 2006, varied to provide that the New Common Shares
    were paid or distributed by Stelco under the Plan at a price of $5.50 per
    share.  Based on the price per share, the New Warrants should be valued at
    $1.44 per warrant. Given our conclusion that Plan value is to govern, the
    FRNs should be valued as stated in the Plan.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[148]<span

    further observation needs to be made.  This decision should not be taken
    to have determined the value of the securities in the Turnover Proceeds to
    be used to provide “payment in full” of the Deficiency Claim.  That issue
    was not before us.  </p>
  <h2>V.  The Share Elects’ Appeal (C46916)</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    have before us an appeal from the order of the motion judge dated March 6,
    2007.  This appeal involves a dispute between the Debentureholders who elected
    to take shares under Section 2.07 of the Plan and those who did not, as to
    the appropriate method of allocating the Turnover Proceeds amongst themselves.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    dispute had its genesis in the motion judge’s earlier decision – the subject
    of the foregoing appeal – to apply a market value approach to the distributions
    under the Plan for purposes of quantifying the Senior Debt Holders’ Deficiency
    Claim.  Using the $17.72 per share market price per share fixed by the motion
    judge in his earlier decision for purposes of determining the allocation
    as between the Share Elect and the Cash Elect creditors had the effect of
    skewing the allocation of the Turnover Proceeds in favour of the Cash Elects
    and depriving the Share Elects of the benefit of their decision to invest
    in the new Stelco.  The motion judge resolved this issue by concluding that
    the Turnover Proceeds should be allocated amongst the Senior Debt Holders
    based upon their respective claims under the Plan using a price of $5.50
    per share.  He said that this approach was consistent with what would have
    been the outcome of the earlier motion regarding the quantum of the Senior
    Debt Holders’ Deficiency Claim if that issue had been resolved by determining
    the distribution price of the shares <u>before</u> giving effect to the Share
    Election, and hinted – none too subtly – that he may have erred in not doing
    so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    counsel on the second appeal agreed, however, that if the first appeal were
    allowed with respect to the distribution price of the New Common Shares,
    and that price were fixed at $5.50 per share, this second appeal becomes
    moot.  At a price of $5.50 per share, the Share Elects and the Cash Elects
    are treated equally on the allocation of the Turnover Proceeds.  It is therefore
    unnecessary for us to decide the second appeal and it is dismissed as moot.</p>
