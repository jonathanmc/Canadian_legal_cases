    Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15 and failed to take into account the

  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor met with the client in October 2003 to discuss representing the
    client in matrimonial proceedings.  In November 2003, the client signed a
    retainer agreement which provided for the payment of a retainer that would
    be held in trust and would be applied to pay accounts as they were rendered,
    the delivery of regular interim billing, and the issuance of a final account “in
    which the complexity of the issues, the obstacles met from opposing counsel/client
    and the result obtained will also be taken into consideration in fixing the
    amount of the final fee.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 29, 2005, the client advised the solicitor through email that she was
    changing solicitors and terminating the retainer.  After receiving an interim
    bill dated April 15, the client requested a final account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    affidavit filed by an employee in the solicitor’s office advises that he
    told the client on May 5, 2005 that she should consider the interim account
    as being final, that he would be sending her a cheque that same day for the
    bulk of the retainer remaining in trust, but that he would retain a relatively
    small sum for several days until he could verify that nothing was owing to
    the process server on the client’s account.  The solicitor’s office provided
    no written confirmation of this exchange.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    client’s evidence was that she expected a final account.  She produced an
    e-mail sent to the solicitor’s office on May 30, 2005 in which she enquires
    about the final bill.  According to the client, it was subsequent to this
    e-mail, on June 3, that she was told that she should treat the April 15 bill
    as being final.  Later that same day, she received the cheque from the solicitor
    in reimbursement of the balance of the retainer that had been held in trust.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 13, the client wrote the Assessment Office at the Milton Court House
    for an assessment of the account.  On June 15, the client obtained an order
    for assessment of the solicitor’s account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor moved to set aside the order for assessment as having been requested
    more than thirty days after delivery of the April 15 account.  The application
    judge considered the evidence and, based largely on the client’s May 30 e-mail
    to the solicitor, found that it was only after May 30 that the client was
    told to treat the April 15 interim account as being final.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge then used that date as constituting the date of delivery
    of the final account for purposes of calculating the one month period stipulated
    in s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> and rejected the solicitor’s motion
    to set aside the order for assessment.</p>
  <h2>ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two issues raised in this appeal: </p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the application judge err in finding that the requisition for assessment
    was made within one month of delivery of the final account? </p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the application judge err in failing to rule that the clause in the retainer
    agreement stipulating that the client has fifteen days to question the account
    overrides the statutory one month period within which to requisition an assessment
    of an account?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor also addressed other sections of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  These
    submissions only have relevance in the event that the solicitor succeeds
    on either of the two issues set out above.  As I have found against the solicitor
    on both grounds, I need not address the submissions on the other sections
    of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2><span style='font-weight:normal;
'>a)         <u>Did the application judge err in finding that the requisition
        for assessment was made within one month of delivery of the final account?</u></span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor maintains that the application judge had no basis for finding that,
    for purposes of s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, the delivery date of
    the final account was June 3, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would reject this ground of appeal.  There was ample evidence in support
    of the application judge’s finding.  The retainer agreement contemplated
    the issuance of a final bill within which a final fee would be set.  As provided
    in the retainer agreement, the amount of the final fee would depend on a
    number of factors other than docketed hours.  The client was justified, therefore,
    in seeking a final bill and in waiting for receipt of this final bill before
    requesting an assessment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    client’s evidence also supported the application judge’s finding.  Her evidence
    was that the first time she was told that the April 15 interim account should
    be treated as the final bill was June 3, 2005.  It was also on June 3 that
    the client received the cheque in reimbursement of the balance of the retainer
    that had been held by the solicitor in her trust account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as noted by the application judge, the client’s May 30, 2005 email to the
    solicitor made it clear that at the end of May she was still waiting for
    a final account.  </p>
  <h2><span style='font-weight:normal;'>b)         <u>Did the application judge
        err in failing to rule that the clause in the retainer agreement stipulating
        that the client has fifteen days to question the account overrides the
        statutory one month period within which to requisition an assessment
        of an account?</u></span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor submits that the retainer agreement reduced to fifteen days the
    time period within which the client could seek an assessment pursuant to
    s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  The provision in the retainer agreement
    on which the solicitor relies reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I agree to forthwith
    advise within fifteen days of any discrepancy, inaccuracy and/or query with
    respect to the account billed.  If no such discrepancy, inaccuracy and/or
    query is voiced, verbally or in writing, by myself, I accept the terms of
    the accounts billed for services rendered. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    requisition for assessment that is the subject of the challenge by the solicitor
    was made pursuant to s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> which reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>3. Where the retainer of the solicitor is not disputed and there are no
    special circumstances, an order may be obtained on requisition from a local
    registrar of the Superior Court of Justice, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) by the client,
    for the assessment of a bill already delivered, within one month from its
    delivery;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    the <i>Solicitors Act</i> does not contain a clause specifically prohibiting
    the parties from contracting out or waving the rights contained therein,
    the solicitor submits that the terms of the retainer agreement should govern.  Because
    the client did not raise a concern about the April 15 account within the
    fifteen days agreed to, she should be prevented from now seeking an assessment
    of the account pursuant to the terms of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would reject this ground of appeal and would do so for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    on the facts found by the application judge, the April 15 interim account
    only became the final account on June 3, 2005.  The request for assessment
    of this final account was made on June 15, well within the fifteen day period
    stated in the contract.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there are public policy considerations that mete in favour of restricting
    the parties’ ability to contract out of the rights and obligations created
    by the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  This court in <i>Plazavest Financial Corp.
    v. National Bank of Canada</i> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 641 at para. 14 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), adopted the comments made by Adams J. in <i>Borden &amp; Elliott v. Barclays
    Bank of Canada </i>(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 352 at 357-58 (Gen. Div.) where he
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The <i>Solicitors
      Act</i> begins with s.&nbsp;1 reflecting the legal profession’s monopoly
      status.  This beneficial status or privilege of the profession is coupled
      with corresponding obligations set out in the Act and which make clear
      that the rendering of legal services is not simply a matter of contract.  This
      is not to say a contract to pay a specific amount for legal fees cannot
      prevail.  It may.  But even that kind of agreement can be the subject of
      review for fairness: see s. 18 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    in <i>Plazavest</i>, this court, while recognizing that the terms of a contract
    between a solicitor and client are of some significance, rejected “the contention
    that an agreement between a client and a lawyer may preclude the client from
    resorting to the Act or the inherent power of the court to seek an assessment
    of the lawyer’s fees”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    set out in <i>Price v. Sonsini</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 257 at para. 19 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Public confidence
    in the administration of justice requires the court to intervene where necessary
    to protect the client’s right to a fair procedure for the assessment of a
    solicitor’s bill.  As a general matter, if a client objects to a solicitor’s
    account, the solicitor should facilitate the assessment process, rather than
    frustrating the process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>It would, in my view, be contrary to the public interest
    to allow solicitors and clients to contract out of the statutory rights granted
    to clients to have their accounts assessed within the statutory time frame.</p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
