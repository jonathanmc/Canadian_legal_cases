    principal grounds of appeal from conviction concern the appellant’s party

    a new trial on the charge of aggravated assault.  I would also allow the
    appeal from conviction for failing to provide the necessaries of life and
    enter an acquittal on that charge as the verdict of guilty cannot be supported
    by the evidence.  In light of this conclusion, I need not deal with the appellant’s

    appellant’s child, Matthew, was born very premature on May 2, 2002.  At birth
    he weighed only two pounds.  On June 14, two and a half months later, he
    was discharged from the hospital.  He weighed slightly under five pounds,
    was in good health and had no physical injuries.  One week later, on Friday,
    June 21, a public health nurse visited the apartment shared by the appellant
    and her partner, Raymond Staniforth.  The nurse found the child to be in
    good health.  The appellant told her, however, that the child had been crying
    for seven hours the previous afternoon and evening.  The nurse told the appellant
    and Staniforth that this was not normal and that they should seek medical
    attention if the crying persisted.  They told the nurse that they had an
    appointment with the baby’s physician the following Monday, June 24, but
    agreed to go to the hospital if the child continued to cry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only direct evidence as to what happened to the baby from the time he was
    brought home to when he was seen by physicians on Monday, June 24 is provided
    by the appellant and her parents.  Staniforth did not testify.  The appellant
    spoke to her parents during the week before the scheduled appointment and
    told them the child was crying a great deal. On Sunday, June 23, the appellant’s
    father drove the appellant and Matthew to his mother-in-law’s house for a
    birthday party.  While the child was irritable and crying, he thought it
    was because of the heat in appellant’s apartment.  However, the appellant
    also showed her father Matthew’s left foot, which he observed to be slightly
    swollen and reddish/pinkish in colour.  He told the appellant to take the
    baby to the doctor the next day.  The appellant’s mother, who had observed
    that the baby’s foot was puffy and swollen from the knee down, gave similar
    advice. During the party the baby ate and slept while he was passed around
    from relative to relative, and cried only on two occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Monday, the appellant and Staniforth took the baby to their family physician
    for the scheduled appointment.  The appellant testified that by the time
    they arrived at the physician’s office, she notice Matthew’s leg was worse.
    The physician and the nurse who examined Matthew immediately concluded that
    the leg was broken.  They notified the Children’s Aid Society and upon instruction,
    the nurse accompanied the family to the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect
    clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children.  X-rays at the hospital showed
    a number of factures and the child was subsequently apprehended by the CAS. </p>

    Crown and the defence called expert evidence concerning the cause of the
    fractures.  The Crown paediatric radiologist identified eight injuries, comprised
    of fractures and abnormalities, that were caused over a period of several
    days.  There were several injuries to the bones of both legs and a fracture
    of the first rib.  The rib injury was significant since it was the evidence
    of the Crown experts that it was highly unlikely that this fracture could
    have been caused except through the deliberate application of great force.  The
    Crown experts also relied upon the fact that there were so many injuries
    as an indication of deliberate abuse as opposed to accident.</p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence relied upon the evidence of Dr. Marvin Miller, an expert in dysmorphology<a href="#_ftn2"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    premature infants are at much greater risk for accidental fractures because
    they have decreased bone loading.  It was his view that Matthew suffered
    from osteopenia, which refers to demineralization of the bones or decreased
    bone density.  He referred to literature showing that even normal handling
    of premature infants in hospital can result in fractures.  In his opinion,
    the most likely explanation for the constellation of fractures seen in Matthew
    was his prematurity and diminished bone loading.  In other words, the fractures
    were likely caused simply by normal handling of the infant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Crown experts acknowledged that premature infants do have less bone density
    and are at greater risk for fractures.  They also agreed that Matthew suffered
    from osteopenia.  However, they did not agree that lack of bone density could
    explain the many fractures, especially the fracture to the first rib.  This
    injury was likely caused by forceful squeezing of the chest and could not
    have been caused by normal handling.  </p>

    appellant testified and denied abusing the child or ever seeing Staniforth
    harm the child.  She could offer no explanation for the various injuries
    except that on Sunday, June 23, while Matthew was lying on her chest after
    his 3:00 a.m. feeding, he jolted and flew off her chest.  She grabbed him
    by the leg and brought him back.  He let out a single cry and then went back
    to sleep.  She did not hear or feel anything break.  However, later that
    morning, she noticed that his leg was puffy.  The condition of the leg did
    not change throughout the day and he was handled by several people at the
    party without incident.  On the Monday morning, she noticed that the leg
    was red and she pointed this out to her paediatrician’s nurse when she and
    Staniforth took the baby for his scheduled appointment.  It never occurred
    to her that the leg was broken until the nurse made that suggestion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair reading of the appellant’s evidence is that she was with her infant
    virtually the entire time after he was discharged from the hospital until
    he was apprehended by the CAS.  Since Staniforth worked, the appellant was
    often alone with the child. There were only very brief periods when Staniforth
    was alone with the child, for example, when he may have awakened before her
    and attended to the child.  The appellant was adamant that neither she nor
    Staniforth would have intentionally injured the child.  Except for the incident
    when the infant bounced off her chest, she could offer no explanation for
    the many fractures.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s case on the charge of failing to provide necessaries of life was
    based on the delay in seeking medical attention.  Further, as I understand
    it, the Crown did not rely upon the fact that the infant was crying, perhaps
    excessively, as a reason to seek medical attention.  There was uncontradicted
    evidence from the public health nurse that the child appeared normal on Friday,
    June 21.  The Crown’s case therefore turned on the delay in seeking medical
    attention on the weekend, presumably because of the fracture to the leg that
    likely happened after the nurse’s visit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offence of failing to provide necessaries in this case required that the
    Crown prove, pursuant to s. 215(2)(<i>a</i>)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that
    the delay in treatment endangered the child’s life or was likely to cause
    the health of the child to be endangered permanently.  In his charge to the
    jury, the trial judge suggested that there was no medical evidence to support
    the failing to provide necessaries charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As I recall
    there was no medical opinion about whether or not this delay might have had
    the effect of causing a risk of permanent endangerment to the life or health
    of Matthew.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her helpful submissions, Ms. Joyal, counsel for the Crown, referred us to
    the testimony of the Crown’s principal expert witness, Dr. Michelle Shouldice.  Dr.&nbsp;Shouldice
    testified that if a broken leg is not properly treated the child will very
    likely be in more pain, and the bone may take longer to heal and may not
    heal as well.  Ms.&nbsp;Joyal fairly acknowledged that this evidence did
    not indicate that a delay of two or three days would cause permanent endangerment
    to the child’s health.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “endangers,” within the context of the nuisance offence in s. 180 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, has been interpreted by this court in <i>R. v.
    Thornton</i> (1991), 1 O.R. (3d) 480 at 487-88, affirmed [1993] 2 S.C.R.
    445, as meaning “exposing someone to danger, harm or risk, or putting someone
    in danger of something untoward occurring”.  No doubt, if the leg was left
    untreated or if there was a substantial delay in treatment, permanent endangerment
    to health might have been made out.  But here, the Crown staked its case
    for failure to provide necessaries on the short period of time between when
    the infant was seen by the public health nurse on Friday and the family’s
    attendance at the physician’s office on Monday.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, given the relatively short period of time involved, the Crown did
    not prove that the appellant’s failure to obtain earlier medical attention
    permanently endangered the child’s health.  The conviction for this offence
    cannot be supported by the evidence.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal
    on the charge of failing to provide necessaries, quash the conviction and
    enter an acquittal.</p>

    appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal relating to the charge to
    the jury on aggravated assault.  The principal grounds of appeal, however,
    concern the application of the so-called “deemed consent” defence and the
    directions given on party liability.  In light of my conclusion with respect
    to the directions on party liability, I do not find it necessary to deal
    with all of the grounds of appeal.  And, although it is not strictly necessary
    to do so, I will provide some comments on the application of the deemed or
    implied consent defence that may be of assistance if the Crown chooses to
    pursue the new trial.</p>

    the jury found that the child had been abused, there was substantial evidence
    that the abuse was inflicted by the appellant or by Staniforth with the appellant’s
    knowledge, since the appellant testified that she was with the baby virtually
    the entire time he was at home.  There was only the vaguest hint in her evidence
    that Staniforth was ever alone with the child. On the rare occasions when
    he was alone with the child, it was only for a very short period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the state of the evidence, and the appellant’s duty to protect her child,
    if the injuries were the result of child abuse, the jury would likely have
    had little difficulty in finding that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of party liability was made out.  That is, that at the very least,
    the appellant, by failing to intervene to protect her child, did something
    that had the effect of assisting or encouraging her co-accused in the assault
    of the child.  It was likely that the only live issue was whether the appellant
    had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> to make her a party to the offence.  In
    particular, the jury had to understand that it was not enough that the appellant
    knew that her child was being abused by her co-accused, but that her actions
    or her failure to act were for the purpose of assisting or encouraging Staniforth
    in the commission of the offence.  It would have been open to the jury to
    infer the requisite <i>mens rea</i> from the fact that the appellant knew
    the child was being abused, but this was not a necessary inference.</p>

    am not satisfied that the instructions to the jury clearly would have conveyed
    the<i> mens rea</i> requirement.  In my view, the instructions would have
    left the jury with the belief that they could find the appellant guilty as
    a party if she knew her acts were likely to assist or encourage Staniforth <i>or</i> if
    she intended to aid or abet him.  As I have said, while knowledge can found
    an inference of intention, it alone cannot constitute the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i>.  </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I will turn
    to the third element of the offence that is the intent to aid or abet. The
    third element the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that one
    parent intended to aid or abet the principal offender parent to commit the
    offence. It is not enough that the parent’s acts or omissions actually aided
    or abetted the principal offender parent. It must also be proven that the
    parent <i>knew or intended</i> that his or her acts or omissions would aid
    or abet the principal offender parent to commit the offences. <i>If the parent
    knew that his or her acts or omissions were likely to assist or encourage
    the principal offender parent to commit the offences then you are entitled
    to conclude that the parent intended to aid and abet the principal offender
    parent to commit that offence</i>. On the other hand the Crown does not have
    to prove that the parent knew the exact offence and the precise details of
    the offence that the principal offender would commit. <i>It is sufficient
    that he or she have knowledge of the type of offence or he or she had the
    intention of helping the principal offender</i> parent regardless of the
    offence that he or she intended to commit. You may find it difficult to decide <i>whether
    one parent knew or intended</i> that his or her actions would aid and abet
    the other to commit the offences.  This is because intention and knowledge
    are matters of the mind and we cannot see inside other people’s minds. <i>In
    deciding what the parent knew or intended</i> you have to use your commonsense
    to infer from all the evidence you have heard what he or she knew or intended.
    In this case there is some evidence that either Miss Palombi or Mr. Staniforth
    personally committed the offences of assault and aggravated assault and that
    the other parent aided and abetted him or her in the commission of those
    offences.</p>

    ), the trial judge told the jury that “for the purpose of aiding” was “the
    same as saying with the effect of aiding”.  Although the misdirection was
    immediately followed by a correct instruction, Dubin J.A. was not satisfied
    that the jury would not have been misled by the former instruction.  As he
    said at p. 120:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      the impugned passage the learned trial Judge gave the jury a simple, but
      inaccurate dictionary meaning of the provisions of s. 21, which bore directly
      on the issue which they were called upon to determine. I am confident that
      the misdirection was an inadvertent one, but the trial Judge did not specifically
      advise the jury that this portion of the charge was not accurate. It would,
      therefore, be unsafe, in my opinion, to let the verdict stand.</span></p>

    have the same concern here.  If the jury accepted the Crown expert evidence
    as to the cause of the injuries, the difficult issue for the jury in this
    case would not have been whether the appellant knew about the abuse, but
    rather, whether her acts or failure to act were with the intention, or for
    the purpose, of aiding or encouraging her co-accused.  The trial judge relieved
    the jury of that difficult task by leaving them with the option of convicting
    the appellant merely on the basis that she knew of the abuse. They were repeatedly
    told that either knowledge or intention to aid was sufficient to convict.</p>

    Crown has not persuaded me that this is a proper case for the application
    of the proviso in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  There
    was little evidence from which a jury could infer that it was the appellant
    rather than Staniforth who committed the assaults on the child.  Party liability
    relieved the jury of having to make that factual determination and thus,
    became the easiest route to conviction.  In my view of the evidence, once
    the jury came to the conclusion, as they must have, that the infant was deliberately
    abused, the only serious question was whether the appellant or Staniforth
    had the requisite intent for party liability.  That was a live question in
    this case.  It would only be open to this court to apply the proviso if we
    were satisfied that the jury would inevitably have inferred the requisite
    intent from the fact that the appellant was aware of the assaults by her
    co-accused.  I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to make that finding.  In
    addition to the appellant’s direct evidence about her treatment of the child
    there was other evidence adduced by the Crown and the defence that suggested
    the appellant handled the child appropriately and cared deeply for him.  Based
    on the record, a finding that she stood by and failed to protect her child
    from the co-accused for the purpose of aiding or encouraging him in the abuse
    of the child was not inevitable.  Accordingly, there must be a new trial.</p>

    intentional application of force – even relatively minor force – without
    the consent of the victim, is an assault unless some defence applies.  There
    is no suggestion of any defence that could apply in this case.  In particular,
    the use of force by way of correction as set out in s. 43 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> was not available given the age of the child: see <i>Canadian Foundation
    for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2004]
    1 S.C.R. 76 at para. 25.  There may also be circumstances where the common
    law necessity excuse, as described in<i> Perka v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2
    S.C.R. 232, may be applicable. No such circumstances arose in this case.</p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Infants,
    however, require care that will call for the intentional, although usually
    minor, application of force.  In addition, parents have a statutory and common
    law duty to provide the necessaries of life to children under their care:  see
    for example s. 215 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Again, the performance of
    this duty will require the use of force.  It is awkward to attempt to excuse
    the use of this type of force through the application of the rigorous standards
    of the necessity defence.  The courts have instead developed the concept
    of deemed consent.</p>

    decision of Weiler J.A., writing for this court, in <i>R. v. E. (A.)</i> (2000),
    146 C.C.C. (3d) 449, is the leading authority in this province on the scope
    of deemed consent for the care of infants.  As she explains at para. 33,
    deemed or implied consent in the case of infants must be strictly limited
    to conduct that is “consistent with the purpose and rationale underlying
    the policy basis for the consent.”  That policy basis is the child’s incapacity
    to care for him or herself.  It follows that only force necessary to care
    for the child can be justified.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    as Weiler J.A. explained, there are two limits on implied consent.  First,
    as she noted at para. 33, the force used must have been for the purpose of
    caring for the child.  In determining whether the force used was for the
    purpose of caring for the child, an objective standard is to be applied.  That
    is, the trier of fact must consider whether the force used is consistent
    with “the customary norms of parenting or what a reasonable parent would
    do in similar circumstances”:  <i>E. (A.)</i> at para. 40.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in the context of criminal charges, a parent will only be deprived of protection
    of implied or deemed consent where the force used clearly exceeds customary
    norms or is clearly excessive: <i>E. (A.)</i> at para. 42.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now turn to the fault elements of assault, including aggravated assault.  First,
    the application of force must be voluntary.  Thus, the striking of someone
    through an involuntary reflex action is not an offence.  For reasons that
    need not be explored here, voluntariness is an element of the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, rather than the <i>mens rea</i>: see <i>R. v. Parks</i>, [1992]
    2 S.C.R. 871 at 896. The appellant’s testimony that she grabbed her infant
    by reflex as he was about to fall off her chest might come within the notion
    of involuntariness.  However, see Professor Don Stuart’s discussion on the
    strict limits on involuntariness based on reflex in <i>Canadian Criminal
    Law: A Treatise, </i>4th ed. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough: Carswell, 2001)<i> </i>at 109-10.  Reflex, however, is of only
    theoretical interest in this case because it is unlikely that the many fractures
    caused to this infant were due to the single reflex action testified to by
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is, of course, also a <i>mens rea</i> or fault element for the simple (common)
    assault offence.  The force must have been applied intentionally.  The touching
    that occurs due to the normal jostling that takes place in a crowded bus
    is a classic example of the unintentional or accidental application of force.  Like
    reflex, unintentional or accidental application of force is of no practical
    application in this case.  The appellant did not claim that she accidentally
    applied force to her child.  Her defence, supported by the evidence of Dr.
    Miller, was that she accidentally caused harm to the child through the intentional
    application of force, albeit in the context of normal care of the infant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is no defence to a charge of assault that the intentional application of
    force caused more harm than was intended, or put another way, that the harm
    was caused accidentally: see <i>R. v. Nette</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 486
    (S.C.C.) at para. 79.  The offence is complete upon the non-consensual intentional
    application of force, barring the successful invocation of some defence,
    such as self-defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the appellant had to fall back on deemed consent.  She was entitled
    to be acquitted unless the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt either
    that the force used was not for the purpose of caring for the child, or if
    it was, that she used excessive force.  The concept of “accident” must be
    understood in this context.  That is, if in caring for her child in accordance
    with customary parental norms and without using excessive force, the appellant “accidentally” harmed
    the child because of the child’s abnormal bone density, she was entitled
    to be acquitted.  I say this on the assumption that she was unaware of this
    unusual condition.  If she was aware of the unusual condition and therefore
    aware of the need for special care, the use of
    “normal” force would be excessive.  Again, this caveat is of no practical
    application in this case.  There is no suggestion in the evidence that the
    appellant knew or even ought to have known that her child was not strong
    enough to tolerate normal handling.  </p>

    final fault element applicable in this case concerns the additional mental
    element for the offence of aggravated assault.  In addition to proof of an
    intentional application of force to make out the charge of aggravated assault,
    the Crown also had to establish objective foresight of bodily harm.  In other
    words, the Crown had to show that a reasonable person would foresee that
    the appellant’s actions would result in bodily harm as defined in s. 2 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> being “any hurt or injury to a person that interferes
    with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient
    or trifling in nature”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in this case, if the jury found that the deemed consent defence was not available
    but that a reasonable person would not have foreseen that the acts would
    cause bodily harm to the infant, the appellant could not be convicted of
    aggravated assault.  Whether the appellant would be guilty of the included
    offence of assault or assault causing bodily harm depends on the fault element
    of assault causing bodily harm.  Since the assault did cause bodily harm,
    if the <i>mens rea</i> for assault and assault causing bodily harm is identical,
    the appellant would be guilty of assault causing bodily harm.  Appellate

    elements for assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault are the same;
    that the offences differ only in the nature of the injury required to make
    out each offence.  Similarly, see <i>R. v. Dewey</i> (1998),<span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

    the force used was not for the purpose of child care as defined in <i>E.

    bone condition a reasonable person would have foreseen that the acts would

    jury would have understood that they could only convict the appellant if
    they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s use of
    force was clearly not for the purpose of caring for the child or that in
    caring for the child she clearly used excessive force.  I am also satisfied
    that the issue of the <i>mens rea</i> for aggravated assault was made sufficiently
    clear to the jury.  Thus, for example, the trial judge charged the jury as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For you to consider
    the first element, the intentional application of force you are to consider
    the same factors that I have described to you in the context of the assault
    charges. <i>The force must be intentional and not by accident. In this case
    you must consider whether the fractures were caused by the intentional application
    of force or by normal childcare activities</i>. Normal childcare activities
    with normal effort or force and no intention to injure do not constitute
    an intentional application of force.  When you consider the second element
    whether the force applied wounded, maimed, disfigured or endangered the life
    of Matthew, if you find the force caused a fracture then the element is made
    out. You do not have to agree which fractures were caused by the intentional
    application of force provided that each of you is satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that one of the fractures resulted from the force that was intentionally
    applied. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge put the essential issues in terms of intention rather than
    consent, the real matters that the jury had to decide were put before them.  Moreover,
    it cannot be forgotten that the factual issues were relatively clear.  The
    Crown contended that this was deliberate child abuse while the defence contended
    that the injuries were caused by normal treatment of a child with an unknown
    vulnerability.  The jury’s ordinary understanding of the term
    “child abuse” would assist them in understanding that injuries resulting
    from normal child care would not lead to culpability.  </p>

    acquittal on the charge of failing to provide necessaries and order a new
    trial on the charge of aggravated assault.</p>

    appellant did describe two other episodes in her evidence, although it hardly
    seems likely that they could explain the diverse injuries.  On one occasion
    when the baby was still in the hospital, she noticed that one nurse was handling
    him in a somewhat rougher way than the other nurses.  She therefore asked
    the hospital to assign a different nurse, which they did.  The second episode
    involved her grandmother.  The infant was in his car seat and she noticed
    her grandmother apparently trying to take the child out without loosening
    the straps.  The appellant quickly intervened and she noticed no injury to
    the child.</p>
