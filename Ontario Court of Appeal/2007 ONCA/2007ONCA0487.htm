    appellants appeal the dismissal of their claim for alleged business interruption
    losses suffered as a result of a fire and seek an order for a new trial.  In
    a nutshell, the appellants contend that they could not know from the reasons
    for judgment why the evidence of their witnesses and, in particular, the
    evidence of their expert was rejected.  Linked to this ground of appeal,
    the appellants submit that the trial judge ignored or misapprehended several
    aspects of their evidence.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For

    appeal. </p>

    appellants operate a vehicle towing and collision repair facility in Bolton,
    Ontario.  Gregory Pannia is the general manager. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 2000, the appellants entered into an agreement with the respondent
    for insurance coverage of the premises against certain risks, including loss
    due to fire.  The coverage included “the actual business loss sustained by
    the Insured and expenses necessarily incurred to resume normal business operations
    resulting from the interruption of the business... as a direct result of
    an insured peril…” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 5, 2000 a fire, apparently set by a disgruntled customer, destroyed
    two large storage trailers and a variety of other equipment on the premises.  The
    respondent paid $168,511.90 in full satisfaction of the physical loss of
    the two trailers and contents.  The appellants also claimed for loss of business
    income and this claim was denied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants argued that their business had been disrupted because:
    1) the unsettling appearance of the premises deterred customers; 2) the amount
    of time that key personnel were obliged to spend dealing with the processing
    of the claim and the appraiser detracted from the business; and 3) rumours
    that Mr. Pannia was involved in the arson caused customers to lose confidence
    in the business. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court heard testimony from fourteen witnesses over seven days and submissions
    were made on the eighth day of trial.  The trial judge’s reasons, released
    some thirteen months after the trial, consisted of ten paragraphs.  She dismissed
    the appellants’ claim, concluding that “the totality of the evidence is that
    the operations continued as they did before the fire except for some seasonal
    slow downs that regularly occur in some divisions within the business.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants challenge the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons in support
    of this conclusion and seek a new trial.  In support of their submission,
    the appellants contend that in rejecting all three bases of their claim for
    loss of business income, the reasons given by the trial judge misapprehended
    the evidence, were irrelevant or insufficiently explained the result, and
    did not adequately explain her rejection of the credibility of the appellants’ witnesses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ position at trial was that, but for the fire, profits would have
    increased more than they did.  Each party led expert evidence with respect
    to loss of business income. The trial judge rejected the evidence of the
    appellants’ expert and accepted the evidence of the respondent’s expert.  Her
    reasons in this regard are also the subject of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Appellate Review
      of Reasons for Judgment</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    standard for measuring the adequacy of reasons is derived from the decision
    of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R.
    869, 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298.  Its ratio is equally applicable, with necessary
    modifications, in the civil context: <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Pension
    Plan</i> <i>v. BF Realty Holdings Ltd. </i>(2002), 214 D.L.R. (4th) 121 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Sheppard</i>,
    Binnie J. described the three functions of reasons for judgment at the trial
    level at para. 24.  They are: 1) explaining to the losing party why he or
    she lost; 2) enabling informed consideration as to whether to appeal; and
    3) enabling interested members of the public to see whether justice has been
    done.  A shorthand way of describing reasons that fulfill these functional
    requirements is to say that the reasons permit meaningful appellate review.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    determination as to whether reasons permit meaningful appellate review is
    a contextual one which takes into consideration a number of factors including
    the positions of the parties, implicit findings, and the extent to which
    the reason for the trial judge’s conclusion is patent on the record.  See <i>e.g</i>.
    L<i>awson v. Lawson</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 3179 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 13. Standing alone, conclusory and generic reasons, in the sense
    that they could apply equally to any other case, do not permit appellate
    review.  In order for the court to determine whether there has been a proper
    application of legal principles, the pathway to the result is necessary: <i>R.
    v. Minuskin </i>(2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 577 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 2-4. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    further comment on a trial judge’s rejection of the evidence of a key witness,
    such as an accused person in a criminal case or the plaintiff in a civil
    contest, may be helpful.  A judge owes the losing party an explanation for
    rejecting the evidence of a key witness and the absence of any explanation
    for rejecting that key witness’s evidence may go a long way to putting the
    reasons beyond the reach of meaningful appellate review.  However, the outcome
    of the appeal still turns on the overarching principle of whether the reasons
    permit meaningful appellate review. See <i><span style='"Times New Roman";'>R.
    v. J.J.R.D.</span></i> (2006), 218 O.A.C. 37 at paras. 35-56 (
    <st1:country-region

    the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that reasons require two stages of

    1-4 of the trial judge’s reasons describe the parties, the fire which took
    place on October 5, 2001, the claim, payment of a portion of the claim, and
    the fact that the release specifically excluded any claim for loss of business
    income that was available.  Paragraph 5 states that the claim for punitive
    damages was properly withdrawn.  Although not directly relevant to this appeal,
    the trial judge found that the evidence of the plaintiffs’ witnesses alleging
    bad faith on the part of the insurer was “very unconvincing”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    6 indicates that the fire occurred while the appellants’ principal, Mr.&nbsp;Pannia,
    was away on vacation and that when he returned he began preparing a proof
    of loss with the assistance of the defendant’s adjusters.  The trial judge
    states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In April 2001, some six months after the fire, Mr.
    Pannia completed the removal of the debris from the towing yard.  <b>One
    of the reasons that it took so long was that Mr. Pannia was very busy running
    the day-to-day operations of Diamond Towing.  </b>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    7 sets out the basis for the appellants’
    claim to entitlement for coverage for lost business income: allegations of
    arson, rumours that Mr. Pannia was involved, and its alleged negative impact
    on business:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Pannia alleged that he did not realize that
    this negative advertising was having such an <b>impact until five or six
    months after the fire</b>.  It was for this reason that he says he did not
    raise this aspect of his loss with the adjustors when they were working with
    him on the proof of loss forms.  <b>A proof of loss form was not submitted
    until May 2002.</b>  The form, submitted by his solicitors, made no reference
    to a business loss.  There was no claim for the business/economic loss until
    September 2002 at which time Mr. John Seigel completed and delivered his
    expert report on behalf of the plaintiffs.  Mr. Siegel, highly respected
    as an expert witness, admitted in cross-examination that he calculated the
    business loss based on assumptions and information provided to him by Mr.
    Pannia.  He did not conduct an independent investigation or an audit of the
    books and records that were presented to him. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    8 summarizes the position of the respondent and the trial judge’s finding
    that the appellant’s witnesses were not credible.  Because it is critical
    to this appeal, the paragraph is reproduced in its entirety below, as is
    the first portion of paragraph 9, which contains the holding of the trial
    judge:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>I now summarize the position of Economical.  Emphasizing
      that Diamond Towing is in the towing business, the evidence was that it
      is in the nature of the business that damaged and burned vehicles are often
      on site.  In other words, customer expectations are such that it is understood
      that this is not a pristine commercial business.  Economical also retained
      an expert, Mr. Petinelli of the firm Petinelli, Mastroluisi to quantify
      the alleged business loss claim and to review the basis on which Mr. Seigel
      came to his conclusions.&nbsp; Mr. Petinelli’s expert report is dated September
      11, 2003.  A key difference in the approach to the calculation of the alleged
      loss by the experts revolved around whether the loss should be calculated
      by examining quarterly performances or whether a month-by month analysis
      would yield more accurate results.  On this point, I prefer the approach
      of Mr. Petinelli.  He stated that the month-by-month review of the companies’ performance
      yielded far more accurate results because such an approach was able to
      identify trends within the various divisions of Diamond’s Operations.  In
      his examination in chief, Mr. Petinelli pointed to a number of significant
      omissions in the calculations that were done by Mr. Seigel.  These omissions,
      largely due to his reliance on Mr. Pannia’s information, call into question
      the conclusions contained in his report.&nbsp; Economical submitted that
      the claim under this portion of the policy’s coverage was not proven.&nbsp; I
      find that there was no credible evidence from the plaintiffs or their witnesses
      that there was any economic loss during the indemnity period of one year
      from the date of the fire.&nbsp;
    Indeed, the combined sales figures of the corporate plaintiffs in the years
    1998 through to 2003 demonstrate remarkable growth.  Accordingly, this claim
    is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>There are two fatal flaws in the theory of the plaintiffs’ case.  Arguably,
      the alleged loss is not covered.  If it is covered, it is not proven on
      a balance of probabilities.  Indeed, the totality of the evidence is that
      the operations continued as they did before the fire except for some seasonal
      slow downs that regularly occur in some divisions within the business.  The
      owners displayed confidence in the future as evidenced by the purchase
      of expensive heavy towing equipment.  Notwithstanding these realities,
      the plaintiffs say that the rumours and negative advertising caused their
      loss of business income in a business that generates its clients by word
      of mouth.  I find that, even if such losses did in fact occur, any damages
      flowing from these causes cannot be considered to be a direct result of
      the fire.  The policy provides for the actual business loss sustained by
      the insured and the expenses necessarily incurred to resume normal business
      operations resulting from the interruption of business, or the untenantability
      of the “premises” when the
    “building” or the “business contents” are damaged as a <b><i>direct</i></b> result
    of an insured peril.&nbsp;[Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    four factors on which the appellants relied as leading to a business interruption
    loss in the aftermath of the fire were: a) the appearance of the premises;
    b) rumours due to the arson; c) negative advertising due to this appearance
    and the rumours; and d) the time spent by Greg Pannia in processing the claim.  Paragraphs
    6 and 7 of the trial judge’s reasons indicate she was clearly aware of the
    bases of the appellants’ claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants advanced a “theory” that the very sight of debris in their storage
    yard might have driven away customers.  The only evidence adduced to link
    the appearance of the appellants’ yard to the alleged business income loss
    came from the appellants’ officers and employees, who testified to noticing
    cancellations and decreasing sales and their conclusion that customers must
    have been scared by the appearance of the premises.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Summarizing
    the position of the respondent at paragraph 8 of her reasons, the trial judge
    stated that “…it is in the nature of the business that damaged and burned
    vehicles are often on site.  In other words, customer expectations are such
    that it is understood that this is not a pristine commercial business.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    holding that the there was no credible evidence in support of the appellants’ theory,
    the trial judge pointed out that, contrary to the evidence of their employees
    of decreasing sales, “ ….the  combined sales figures of the corporate plaintiffs
    in the years 1998 through to 2003 demonstrate remarkable growth.”  The trial
    judge’s conclusion is supported by the agreed fact that profits rose from
    $1.2 million to $1.6 million one year after the fire.  While the appellants
    submit that growth would have been even greater but for the fire, the evidence
    of their employees was that sales had <i>decreased</i>, not that they would
    have been greater.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that, in rejecting the appellants’ submissions that the
    condition of the premises occasioned a loss of business, the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence as to the condition of their yard. While there
    were burnt out vehicles on the premises, the appellants point to evidence
    that it was their practice to cover or tarp them.  The trailers were too
    big to tarp.  No customer gave evidence saying that he or she stayed away
    from Diamond because of the appearance of the premises or on any basis other
    than the rumours.  An examination of the record reveals that the evidence
    from the only two customers who testified, Messrs. Terenzi and Gurprasad,
    mentions only the rumours that Mr.&nbsp;Pannia was involved in setting the
    fire.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    customers were unable to prove that they had sent less work to Diamond after
    the fire, as compared to before the fire.  For example, Mr. Gurprasad testified
    that before the fire he had been sending $500,000 worth of business a year
    to the appellants.  He also testified that he paid $170,000 to $180,000 directly
    to the appellants for their services.  After the fire, he testified that
    because of the rumours he started using other companies but then returned
    to using Diamond again, both giving and recommending business to them.  The
    appellants’ records showed that Mr. Gurprasad paid $6,200 and then $11,000
    for towing services and nothing after that.  Mr. Gurprasad said the appellants’
    records were wrong.  Mr. Gurprasad’s records were never introduced at trial.  Either
    the trial judge correctly rejected his evidence or the appellants’ records
    are completely unreliable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge also misapprehended the evidence when
    she referred to the fact that the appellants purchased expensive equipment
    after the fire as an indicator that they were confident about the future.  The
    appellants point out that these purchases occurred before the fire and had
    no bearing on any business income loss.  The equipment had not, however,
    been delivered or completed prior to the fire and there was no evidence that
    the appellants tried to cancel the sales.  More importantly, any misapprehension
    of the evidence respecting the timing of the purchase of equipment by the
    trial judge did not affect her dismissal of the claim for business interruption.  She
    had already dismissed that claim for the reasons mentioned in the prior paragraph.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Reasons respecting
      credibility</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that although the trial judge found that “there was no
    credible evidence that there was any economic loss during the indemnity period” she
    gave no reason to support her finding. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    bases for rejecting the evidence of the appellants’ witnesses can be gleaned
    from the trial judge’s reasons.  First, although the fire occurred on October
    5, and Mr.&nbsp;Pannia stated he did not realize that business loss was occurring
    until some five or six months later, this would put his realization at March
    or April 5 at the latest.  The proof of claim was filed in May, after Mr.&nbsp;Pannia’s
    realization that business loss was occurring. It makes no mention that a
    claim for loss for business interruption would be forthcoming.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in a footnote to her reasons, the trial judge comments: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the issue of rumours, the plaintiffs called witnesses
    from within the industry.  They strained their credibility greatly when they
    claimed that they did not discuss their evidence with Mr. Pannia and that
    the only time they discussed their evidence with anyone was outside the courtroom
    before testifying at which time they had discussions with [counsel for the
    plaintiff]. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to this footnote, the appellants point out that one witness admitted
    to discussing his evidence with the appellants’ trial counsel.  While the
    trial judge did not elaborate, the record indicates that the appellants’
    employee, Donald&nbsp;Farr, testified that after the fire he noticed sales
    decreasing by about 45%.  Separately, the appellants’ expert, Mr. Siegel,
    having completed his calculations two years after the fire, testified that
    sales for the indemnity period were just under 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent lower
    than the appellants had projected.  Despite this remarkable coincidence,
    Donald Farr testified that he did not discuss his evidence with his employer
    or perform any calculations of his own.  Having regard to the record, this
    court is in a position to tell the appellants why the trial judge made the
    comment she did.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judge preferred the evidence of the respondent’s expert to that
    of the appellants’ expert.  Here again, resort to the record will be necessary.  I
    will address this separately below. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Reasons respecting
      the evidence of the appellants’ expert </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge rejected the evidence of the appellants’ expert,
    Mr. Seigel, because of certain assumptions and omissions in the calculations
    that he had done, yet she did not identify them or explain why they were
    material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    begin by noting that the trial judge gave two other reasons for rejecting
    Mr. Seigel’s report.  First, the trial judge expressed concern about the
    methodology the appellants’ expert employed, which relied on Mr. Pannia’s
    assumptions and information, as opposed to an independent examination of
    the figures of the appellants.  Mr. Seigel admitted that his calculations
    were based on certain assumptions that had to be proven at trial.  For example,
    although the collision division was “doing next to nothing,” for the first
    nine months of 2000 and only had one good month of sales, Mr. Siegel calculated
    his projections of future sales for this division on the basis of sales figures
    for that one month.  He did so on the basis of Mr. Pannia’s claim that he
    was going to concentrate on this division during the indemnity period.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    significant amount of Mr. Siegel’s report was based on the assumption that
    rumours and innuendo caused a loss to the appellants’ business and assumed
    that this would be proven at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his evidence, Mr. Siegel agreed he was told by Greg Pannia that there was
    a delay of one month before the rumours and/or the “negative advertising” began
    to impact the sales figures.  Mr. Siegel used this assumption to explain
    why the business was able to have a very large increase in total sales in
    the month immediately following the fire.  He stated: “I think that’s the
    delayed reaction we are talking about”.  However, despite asking Mr. Siegel
    to assume a delay of one month, Greg Pannia admitted under cross-examination
    that he was not sure when the rumours first began to impact sales figures.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notably,
    Mr. Siegel did not consistently employ the assumption of a one-month delay
    to analyze “business loss” within the various divisions of the business.  He
    was instructed by Mr. Pannia to assume that different divisions of the business
    would have been impacted at different times during the indemnity period.  For
    example, he was asked to assume that there would be a longer delay before
    the “rumours” would impact on the heavy towing division, compared to light
    towing.  The heavy towing division was deemed to have been affected by rumours
    at precisely the time of this division’s first post-fire fluctuation in sales,
    which occurred in the first quarter of 2001.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    witness and employee of the appellants’, Jeffrey Joseph Martin, also provided
    an <i>alternative</i> explanation as to why sales in the heavy towing division
    dropped off gradually during the winter (the first quarter of 2001).  He
    stated that “a large portion” of Diamond’s heavy towing business serviced
    the construction industry.  He further explained that the “[c]onstruction
    industry from past experience closes down usually January, February when
    the ground is frozen too hard to dig.”  The slow-down in the construction
    industry, therefore, “is not really in the winter, it is in the end of winter,
    beginning of spring”.  This coincides with the period in which Mr. Siegel
    was asked to assume that the heavy towing division would be impacted by “the
    rumours”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge correctly realized that the real question was whether there had
    in fact been a business interruption loss, as opposed to a potential business
    interruption loss on the bases alleged.  Inasmuch as the trial judge rejected
    the assumption that rumours respecting the fire resulted in loss of business,
    she could not rely on Mr. Siegel’s report. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second reason the trial judge preferred the report of Mr. Petinelli, the
    respondent’s expert, was that he used a month to month approach which she
    considered to be more accurate than the quarterly calculations used by the
    appellants’ expert.  Mr.&nbsp;Petinelli explained that by looking at monthly
    trends one can identify fluctuations that are not smoothed out. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn now to the third reason given by the trial judge for rejecting the evidence
    of Mr. Siegel.  The previous paragraphs give some insight as to the assumptions
    and omissions that concerned the trial judge but which she did not identify.  The
    record provides additional insight as to what she meant.  Mr. Siegel used
    a non recurring item as a recurring item in his calculation of business loss.  Mr.
    Siegel omitted to show that sales for the small tow truck division were declining.  Mr.
    Pannia admitted that a reduction in the growth of light tow sales may not
    have been due to the rumours but may have been due instead to a shift in
    emphasis to the more lucrative heavy tow market.  Mr. Siegel also omitted
    to take into account that when sales increased there would likely be an increase
    in direct labour costs.  He assumed that despite increased growth, the company
    would continue to operate with the same labour costs. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the assumptions and omissions I have referred to largely emerged in Mr.&nbsp;Siegel’s
    cross&#8209;examination, the trial judge was correct in stating that Mr.&nbsp;Petinelli
    pointed to the omissions in his examination&#8209;in&#8209;chief.  The trial
    judge did not err in rejecting the report of the appellants’ expert and preferring
    that of the respondent’s expert.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to address the trial judge’s
    alternate conclusion that the appellants’
    losses are not covered by the wording of the policy because they were not
    directly caused by the fire. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Overall Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Standing
    alone, the trial judge’s reasons make meaningful appellate review difficult.  In
    the result, however, even if the appellants are correct in their submission
    that the trial judge’s reasons do not fulfill the functional requirement
    of reasons as they ought to, having regard to the record, the basis for her
    rejection is patent and this court has told the appellants why they lost. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submitted that if they were not successful on this appeal, the
    court should consider that they did not receive the respondent’s factum in
    a timely fashion and that this should be taken into account as a factor in
    fixing costs.  The respondent states that it is prepared to take a discount
    of its costs because, due to personnel changes in its office, the factum
    was late.  Accordingly, I would award the costs of the appeal to the respondent
    and fix those costs in the amount of $15,000 all inclusive. </p>
