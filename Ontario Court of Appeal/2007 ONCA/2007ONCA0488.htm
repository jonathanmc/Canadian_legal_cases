    Caruana was committed to stand trial in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    in 1994 for his role in a crime family and his involvement in an international
    drug conspiracy between 1977 and 1986.  He was tried along with a number
    of other defendants.  Prior to the commencement of the trial, the criminal
    court in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    found that Mr. Caruana was a “defaulter”.  He did not appear at his trial;
    the Italian court proceeded in his absence.  Mr. Caruana was represented
    by counsel at the trial.  He was convicted of offences relating to his role
    in the international drug conspiracy and with the crime group.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1997, Mr. Caruana appealed his convictions.  There he had the benefit of
    both counsel of his choice and court-appointed counsel but, again, he was
    not present at the hearing of the appeal.  His appeal was dismissed and,
    later in 1997, the Italian appeal court sentenced him to twenty-one years
    and ten months imprisonment.  An enforcement order was issued by the Italian
    court on February 6, 1998, but no part of the sentence was served as Mr.
    Caruana had
    “absconded”.  </p>

    2000, Mr. Caruana pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    and was sentenced to eighteen years in prison.  </p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    began extradition proceedings.  At that time, Mr. Caruana was entitled to
    be considered for conditional release from the Canadian prison in which he
    was serving his sentence for the Canadian offences.  The record of the case
    against Mr.&nbsp;Caruana provided by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    showed his involvement with a crime family, international drug transactions
    and transfers of large sums of money to facilitate those transactions.  The
    evidence came from informants who had also been charged, electronic surveillance
    and investigators.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    November 2004, Mr. Caruana was ordered committed for surrender on the Italian
    offences by Watt J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Caruana made submissions to the Minister of Justice on February 24, 2005,
    arguing that it would be abusive to surrender him because the trial in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    was conducted in his absence and he had no further right of appeal or review.  On
    November 17, 2005, the Minister ordered his surrender to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    , finding that it was not unjust or oppressive to surrender him given the
    findings of the extradition judge and that Mr. Caruana would be entitled
    to seek a review of his convictions in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    .  The Minister found that assurances of a new trial were not necessary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 10, 2006, Mr. Caruana made further submissions to the successor Minister
    of Justice and asked that the Minister rescind the surrender order.  The
    Minister declined to reconsider the surrender order.  </p>

    Caruana appeals his committal and seeks judicial review of the Minister’s

  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>A PRELIMINARY MATTER</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Caruana seeks to introduce as fresh evidence, the opinion of Antonella Cuccureddu,
    an Italian lawyer, regarding the likelihood that Mr. Caruana would be able
    to successfully obtain a review of his Italian convictions under provisions
    in Italian criminal law procedure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence could have been adduced at the proceedings before the committal
    judge or the Minister or both.  Ms. Cuccureddu was known to Mr. Caruana prior
    to the extradition hearing in October 2004, as she was scheduled to give
    sworn testimony and be cross-examined in September 2004.  Mr. Caruana did
    not seek to tender her opinion at the committal hearing nor did he include
    it in support of his submissions to the Minister in February 2005 or May
    2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    fresh evidence relates to the availability of the Italian review process
    and what rights Mr.&nbsp;Caruana will have if he is extradited.  That matter
    is the very essence of the position argued by Mr. Caruana at committal and
    before the Minister so it cannot be said that the issue is new.  In our view,
    the proposed fresh evidence comes too late in the process to be adduced for
    the first time now and ought not to be admitted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, it would make no difference to the result.  The Italian authorities
    have confirmed that Mr. Caruana may seek a review of his conviction.  Furthermore,
    there is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Caruana has sought to
    bring such a review application.  To that extent, the fresh evidence is about
    the hypothetical outcome of proceedings that may never be brought.  It is
    speculative.  Moreover, the information in the affidavit fails to demonstrate
    that Mr.&nbsp;Caruana’s surrender would be unjust or oppressive and, thus,
    is not relevant to the Minister’s surrender decision.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Appeal and Application
      for Judicial Review</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Caruana makes three primary arguments on the appeal and application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    he argues that he was committed on unreliable evidence and, consequently,
    in light of <i>United States of America v. Ferras</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C.
    (3d) 353 (S.C.C.), his committal cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  <i>Ferras </i>permits the extradition judge to remove evidence
    from judicial consideration if satisfied that the evidence is so manifestly
    unreliable or defective that it should be disregarded and given no weight
    for the purposes of deciding whether the test for committal has been met: <i>United
    States of America v. Anderson </i>(2007), 219 O.A.C. 369 at para. 29 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. requested, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 159.  The evidence
    in the record of the case was sufficient to justify committal: it is neither
    manifestly unreliable or defective.  Nor is it vague or conclusory.  It establishes
    a <i>prima facie </i>case that Mr.&nbsp;Caruana was one of the organizing
    forces of an international heroin drug conspiracy, a member of a crime group
    and involved in money laundering.  The evidence consists not only of the
    testimony of co-operating accomplices but also of bank documents showing
    that Mr. Caruana received more than $35,000,000 in cash in his various bank
    accounts, which money was subsequently transferred to Switzerland and paid
    to people associated with international drug trafficking.  Mr. Caruana does
    not put forth any evidence to undermine that contained in the record of the
    case.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Mr. Caruana argues that s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i> is violated because
    he is to be surrendered to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    where he was convicted <i>in absentia</i> and he has no assurance of a new
    trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    we disagree.  Mr. Caruana has not demonstrated that his surrender is contrary
    to s. 7.  He was found to be a “defaulter” in accordance with Italian law.  Mr.&nbsp;Caruana
    has provided no evidence on which to dispute that finding.  Also in accordance
    with Italian law, he was tried and convicted <i>in absentia</i>.  Further,
    he is entitled to seek a review of his convictions pursuant to Italian law.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that a foreign state has a different legal system does not mean that
    its system of justice is unfair. The principles of fundamental justice in
    the extradition context recognize that differences in the criminal justice
    systems of other jurisdictions are to be respected and that the <i>Charter </i>guarantees
    are not to be given extraterritorial effect to govern how criminal proceedings
    in a foreign state are conducted.  See <i>Kindler v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Justice)</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 55 (S.C.C.).  Mr. Caruana
    led no evidence to suggest that the safeguards which exist in the Italian
    justice system in respect of <i>in absentia </i>proceedings operate unfairly,
    either generally or in Mr. Caruana’s specific circumstances.  The fact that
    the trial proceeded <i>in absentia </i>and the question of whether Mr. Caruana
    is to be granted a review of his convictions are matters that are to be determined
    by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    .    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    we see nothing unconstitutional in the discretion given to the Minister under
    the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c.&nbsp;18<i> </i>to order Mr. Caruana’s
    surrender.  As the Supreme Court noted in <i>United States of America v.
    Burns</i> (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 67, only circumstances of a “very
    exceptional nature” would constitutionally limit the Minister’s discretion
    in extradition cases.  Mr. Caruana has failed to demonstrate that his surrender,
    after having been convicted <i>in absentia </i>and without an assurance of
    a new trial, shocks the conscience of Canadians.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    Mr. Caruana submits that the Minister did not satisfy himself that Art.&nbsp;1(2)
    of the <i>Treaty between
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    Concerning Extradition,</i>
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    , 6 May 1981, Can. T.S. 1985 No. 17 has been met.  This argument rests on
    the assertion that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    was without jurisdiction to prosecute the offences.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no merit in this submission. 
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    clearly had the jurisdiction to prosecute the offences: the Italian Court
    of Appeal in Palmero found that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    was “the main centre” where the crime families resided and the drug trafficking
    took place.  The fact that Mr. Caruana was not physically present in
