    the 1980s, Dr. Olivieri pursued clinical research in thalassemia, a genetic
    blood disorder.  Thalassemia patients require regular blood transfusions.  A
    side effect is the build&#8209;up of excess iron.  Patients take drugs called
    iron chelators to remove excess iron.  </p>

    Olivieri and her colleagues conducted clinical trials to assess the efficacy
    and safety of an oral iron chelator called deferiprone.  Apotex Inc., a major
    Canadian pharmaceutical manufacturer, sponsored the research.  Dr. Barry
    M. Sherman is Apotex’s chairman.  Jack M. Kay is the president of Apotex.  I
    will refer to Apotex, Dr. Sherman and Mr. Kay, collectively, as the “respondents”.</p>

    $20 million in general and special damages.</p>

    examined the respondents for approximately 20 days.  The parties produced

    attended with her counsel Paul Michell (60 Minutes action) and Christopher
    Ashby (CBC action).  Dr. Spino and Dr. Sherman attended for the respondents,
    along with their counsel, David Brown, Adrian Lang, and Jessica Bookman.  A
    CBC representative attended with counsel.  </p>

    mediation began on November 2, 2004, with a plenary session of all parties
    and counsel.  The parties and counsel then separated into three rooms (Dr.&nbsp;Olivieri;
    respondents; CBC defendants), where they remained for the rest of the day.  Mr.&nbsp;Adams
    conducted “shuttle diplomacy” among the parties.  No other plenary session
    ever took place.</p>

    the end of the first day, Dr.&nbsp;Olivieri made three alternative offers

    the second day of the mediation, the parties reconvened in their separate
    rooms.  Towards the end of that day, the respondents made a handwritten counter&#8209;offer
    to Dr.&nbsp;Olivieri on three sheets of “flip chart” paper (the
    “counter-offer”); most of the counter-offer was in the handwriting of the
    respondents’
    counsel.  Dr.&nbsp;Spino initialled the counter-offer on behalf of the respondents.  Dr.&nbsp;Olivieri
    also initialled the counter&#8209;offer.</p>

    the conclusion of the mediation on November 3, 2004, Dr. Olivieri had not
    accepted the counter-offer because she wanted time to consult with HSC about
    her legal fees.  She was given 48 hours within which to accept the counter&#8209;offer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    following day (November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2004), Mr. Michell e-mailed a transcription
    of the counter&#8209;offer to Mr.&nbsp;Brown and sought permission to send
    a copy to HSC’s counsel on a confidential basis.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.&nbsp;Brown
    replied by e-mail that afternoon, advising that the respondents did not consent.  He
    did not suggest there was any need for agreement on subsequent documents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
    written communication was exchanged between counsel by letter and e-mail
    on November 4, 2005; in one e-mail from Mr. Brown to Mr. Michell it was noted
    that Dr. Olivieri would not be able to complete the settlement until she
    had resolved outstanding issues with HSC.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    decided to accept the counter&#8209;offer and so instructed her counsel.  On
    November 5, 2004 – that is, within the 48-hour window - Mr.&nbsp;Michell
    so advised Mr.&nbsp;Brown by telephone.  He also confirmed Dr. Olivieri’s
    acceptance by letter (sent by FAX) that day, again attaching a transcription
    of the counter&#8209;offer.   </p>

    well, Mr.&nbsp;Michell wrote to Ms.&nbsp;Lang on November&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2004,
    enclosing full&#8209;sized copies of the three
    “flip chart” pages.  Again, there was nothing in her response to suggest
    that the agreement was conditional or subject to further documentation.  </p>

    October 31, 2005, after Dr. Olivieri reached a settlement with HSC, her counsel
    advised counsel for the respondents that Dr. Olivieri was able to complete
    the terms of the settlement.  The respondents, for the first time, claimed
    that there was no settlement agreement.  They maintained that the counter-offer
    represented a consensus on certain principles but that a final settlement
    was subject to further documentation agreed on by all parties, particularly
    the non-disparagement agreement.  They also alleged that Dr. Olivieri had
    continued to disparage Apotex publicly after the “settlement” had been concluded.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Olivieri brought a motion to enforce the alleged settlement agreement.  The
    respondents opposed the motion on the basis that either the parties had no
    meeting of the minds about the meaning of disparagement or that Dr. Olivieri
    had repeatedly breached the agreement by continuing to disparage Apotex.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    would allow the appeal.  As I explain below, the parties had a mutual intention
    to create a legally binding agreement and agreed on all the essential terms
    of the settlement; the fact that there may now be disagreement about whether
    the settlement has been breached does not mean that no concluded agreement
    ever existed.</p>

    will be seen, there is some confusion about what was decided below in respect
    of the respondents’ alternative position that if there were a concluded agreement,
    Dr. Olivieri had either breached or repudiated it.  Consequently, the Order
    and the reasons of the motion judge will be set out in some detail before
    the issues are analysed.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE ORDER UNDER

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Order is very short.  There are two paragraphs by way of preamble.  The first
    recites that Dr. Olivieri made a motion for an order enforcing a settlement
    agreement and requiring the parties to comply with the terms of that agreement.  The
    second lists the evidence considered.  The full text of the balance of the
    Order reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras. 13 and 21 of the reasons, the motion judge states his conclusion that
    there had been no meeting of the minds between the parties sufficient to
    give rise to an enforceable agreement.  In his view, the agreement was conditional
    on further elaboration and negotiation of the word “disparage” in para. 4(b)
    of Part A of the counter-offer and of the word “scientific” in para. 4(b)(iii)
    of the same.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to “disparage”, the motion judge held that elaboration was essential
    to Apotex.  In paras. 17 and 21, he stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17]     I conclude that at least Apotex anticipated
    that what would be said or not said by Dr. Olivieri within the general and
    broad use of the word ‘disparage’ would be further detailed in additional
    documentation that would be an essential part of the settlement agreement.  Dictionary
    definitions of the word “disparage” contain other words of general meaning
    such as to “discredit” or to “denigrate” that lack precision, particularly
    for ongoing public appearances.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>...</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[21]     … A more detailed delineation of what would
    be regarded as ‘disparaging conduct’ I conclude was regarded by the parties,
    particularly Apotex, as an essential term of the agreement, one which was
    not finalized. …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    para. 16 of the reasons, the motion judge said this, in respect of para.
    4(b)(iii) of Part A:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[16]     The pleadings in the action are replete
    with concerns by both parties but Apotex in particular, regarding public
    statements made.  In the context of the history between the parties and particularly
    the wording of Item 4(b)(iii), that “parties will only express <u>future</u> views
    about deferiprone in <u>scientific</u> forum” (emphasis added), anticipates
    further elaboration as to what is meant by the word “scientific.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    the motion judge reasoned that additional documentation was required in relation
    to para. 2 of Part B of the counter-offer.  At para. 18 of the reasons, he
    wrote:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[18]     In addition, in the context of the pleadings
    and allegations, I conclude that Apotex would require the documentation provided
    for in [para. 2 of Part B] to be specifically part of the settlement package.  It
    has never been provided.  This history of the dealings between Dr. Olivieri
    and the Defendants from at least 1995 shows that the public utterances each
    about the other were central to their dispute and to the resolution of it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 22 of the reasons, the motion judge stated that in view of his disposition, “a
    trial will be required” should the parties not reach a new settlement agreement.
    He went on in para. 23 to say, “The central issue in the trial will be the
    meaning attributable to the statements that were and continue to be made
    by the parties about each other in public forums”.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>ANALYSIS </span></h4>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal raises two issues:  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>(1)       was there a concluded
    settlement agreement? and </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>(2)       if there was, did Dr.
    Olivieri breach or repudiate it?        </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Was There a Concluded
      Settlement Agreement?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    settlement agreement is a contract.  Thus, it is subject to the general law
    of contract regarding offer and acceptance.  For a concluded contract to
    exist, the court must find that the parties: (1) had a mutual intention to
    create a legally binding contract; and (2) reached agreement on all of the
    essential terms of the settlement: <i>Bawitko Investments Ltd. v. Kernels
    Popcorn Ltd. </i>(1991), 79 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at 103-4.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no question but that the first requirement was met: the counter-offer
    was drafted during the course of a court-directed mediation involving multi-million
    dollar law suits and in which all parties were represented by experienced
    legal counsel.  It is apparent that the parties intended to enter into a
    binding legal agreement to resolve all of the outstanding legal proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the second requirement, the motion judge found that there was
    no meeting of the minds in respect of all of the essential terms of the contract.  It
    will be recalled that he held that the counter-offer was conditional on elaboration
    of the words “disparage” and “scientific” in para. 4(b) of Part A of the
    counter-offer.  In coming to this view, the motion judge relied on the evidence
    of the respondents.  But, the respondents’ evidence was based on discussions
    they and their counsel had with Mr. Adams during the mediation.  Dr.&nbsp;Spino
    admitted that the respondents and their counsel never discussed the counter&#8209;offer
    with Dr.&nbsp;Olivieri or her counsel during the mediation, or told them
    that the counter&#8209;offer was conditional upon finalizing documentation.  There
    was no evidence that all parties shared the view that further negotiation,
    elaboration or agreement was necessary.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    determination as to whether a concluded agreement exists does not depend
    on an inquiry into the actual state of mind of one of the parties or on the
    parole evidence of one party’s subjective intention.  See <i>Lindsey v. Heron &amp; Co. </i>(1921),
    64 D.L.R. 92 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ont.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C. (App.Div.)).  Where, as here, the agreement is in writing, it is to
    be measured by an objective reading of the language chosen by the parties
    to reflect their agreement.  As was stated by Middleton J.A. in <i>Lindsey</i> at
    98-9, quoting <u>Corpus Juris</u>, vol. 13 at 265:<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The apparent mutual assent of the parties essential
    to the formation of a contract, must be gathered from the language employed
    by them, and the law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the
    reasonable meaning of his words and acts.  It judges his intention by his
    outward expressions and excludes all questions in regard to his unexpressed
    intention.  If his words or acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest
    an intention to agree in regard to the matter in question, that agreement
    is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real but unexpressed
    state of his mind on the subject.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in my view, it was an error in principle for the motion judge to decide this
    issue based on the subjective intent of one side to the bargain rather than
    on an objective reading of the counter-offer.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viewed
    objectively, there is nothing in the counter-offer to suggest that it was “an
    agreement to agree” or conditional in any respect.  Nothing in the counter-offer,
    either directly or indirectly, suggests that its terms are subject to further
    elaboration, documentation or agreement.  Had it been intended that the terms
    were to be conditional, one would have expected to see language that expressly
    made one or more terms “subject to” further agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead,
    the terms of the counter-offer are straightforward and unconditional:  Part&nbsp;A
    of the counter-offer contains the public part of the settlement agreement.  It
    provides that: (1) the parties will issue a joint settlement statement that
    all litigation is dismissed and (2) file consent dismissals; (3) Dr. Olivieri
    will issue a statement in the terms set out; (4) both parties will provide
    statements in which they express mutual regret for language used in the past
    about the other, agree not to disparage each other in the future, and to
    express views about deferiprone only in scientific forums; and that a press
    release will contain the foregoing.  Part&nbsp;B, the confidential part of
    the settlement agreement, requires Dr. Olivieri to provide Apotex with the
    data listed in para. 160 of the statement of defence and counterclaim and
    that both parties will execute full and final mutual releases.<a

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    counter-offer was not made “subject to” agreement on any of the specified
    documents or terms:  the press release, provision of data and mutual releases
    were the mechanics required to complete the settlement agreement.  As was
    stated in <i>Fieguth v. Acklands Ltd. </i>(1989), 59 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    114 at 121 (B.C.C.A.),<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a> the first question to be asked when deciding whether
    a settlement was concluded is whether the parties reached an agreement on
    all essential terms.  It is only thereafter that the question of completion
    of the agreement is considered.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    acknowledge that there can be sufficient uncertainty about the meaning of
    words or terms in an agreement that it will be held to be unenforceable:
    see <i>Bawitko Investments </i>at 104.  However, in my view, the language
    used in the counter-offer does not suffer from that problem.  As the motion
    judge observed, the dictionary meaning of “disparage” is to “discredit” or “denigrate”.  While
    there may be disagreement about whether the conduct of one of the parties
    amounts to disparagement, that does not mean that the agreement is conditional
    nor does it require elaboration of the meaning of the word.  For similar
    reasons, the word “scientific” needs no elaboration.    </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    policy of the courts is to encourage the settlement of litigation:  <i>Stonehocker
    v. King</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 2653 (Gen. Div.).  The courts “should not be
    too astute to hold” that there is not the requisite degree of certainty in
    any of an agreement’s essential terms: <i>Canada Square Corp. v. Versafood
    Services Ltd. </i>(1982), 34 O.R. (2d) 250 (

    conclusion, as the motion judge applied the incorrect test when determining
    whether an enforceable settlement agreement had been entered into, his conclusion
    must be set aside.  Applying the objective principle of contract formation,
    I conclude that the parties reached agreement on all of the essential terms
    of the settlement agreement, as reflected in the counter-offer.  Consequently,
    the appellant is entitled to a declaration that the parties entered into
    an enforceable settlement agreement on November 5, 2004.    </p>
