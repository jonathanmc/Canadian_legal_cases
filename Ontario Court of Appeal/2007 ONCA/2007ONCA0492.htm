style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal raises the question of whether the territorial limitation contained
    in an automobile insurance policy and in the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. I.8 (the Act) apply to restrict coverage provided in the underinsured
    motorist endorsement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge, Eberhard J., held that the territorial limitations did not
    apply with the result that the respondents are entitled to coverage for the
    automobile accident that occurred in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    and which left the respondent, Everett Sutherland, with quadriplegia.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the appellant argues that the motion judge erred in her interpretation
    of the relevant policy and statutory provisions.  Specifically, the appellant
    submits that the motion judge ought to have concluded that the territorial
    limitation contained in the standard Ontario Automobile Policy No. 1 (the
    Policy) restricted coverage under the Family Protection Coverage set out
    in the Ontario Policy Change Form 44R Endorsement (the Endorsement).  The
    appellant also argues that the territorial restriction imposed on uninsured
    coverage in the Act also precludes coverage because underinsured coverage
    is simply a subset of uninsured coverage.  The respondents disagree.  They
    argue that the Endorsement is not subject to the Policy’s territorial limitation
    and that the Act’s territorial limitation cannot apply because it is not
    specific to underinsured coverage.  Moreover, the respondents argue that
    any ambiguity should be resolved in their favour. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, in my view, the motion judge erred in her interpretation
    of the insurance contract.  I conclude that the territorial limitation in
    the Policy forecloses coverage for the accident in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  Further, since the Act does not address a territorial restriction for
    underinsured coverage directly or indirectly, the insurance contract cannot
    be said to be in conflict with the Act, nor to raise any ambiguity.  Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and declare that the respondents do not have coverage
    for the accident that occurred in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents are Everett Sutherland and his wife and daughter, all of whom
    live in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  They were insured under the Policy issued by the appellant, Pilot
    Insurance Company.  As insureds under that Policy, the respondents purchased
    the optional Endorsement, which provided additional coverage equal to what
    they would have received if the inadequately insured motorists at fault for
    the accident had $1,000,000 of coverage. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    potential at-fault parties in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    accident both had insurance coverage limited to about $18,400.00 CDN per
    policy.  For this reason, they came within the Endorsement’s definition of
    an “inadequately insured motorist”, since their insurance was less than the
    family protection coverage provided by the Endorsement.  It was agreed that
    the money payable under the Jamaican policies would be payable ahead of coverage
    under the Endorsement, but that it would be inadequate to cover Mr. Sutherland’s
    injuries.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    way of a special case, the respondents requested the court to determine whether
    the Endorsement provides coverage to the respondents for the Jamaican accident. </p>
  <h2>Issues</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will deal first with the question regarding whether the Endorsement is subject
    to the Policy.  I will then deal with the question regarding whether the
    Act imposes a territorial restriction on underinsured coverage or raises
    any ambiguity.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    issue turns on the wording of the Policy and the Endorsement.  The Policy,
    which provides basic automobile insurance, contains this territorial limitation<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.2 Where You Are Covered</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This policy covers you and other insured persons
    for incidents occurring in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States of America</st1:country-region>
    and any other jurisdiction designated in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the Endorsement does not include a specific territorial limitation for underinsured
    coverage, it provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>22.</b> …
    Except as otherwise provided in this change form, all limits, terms, conditions,
      provisions, definitions and exclusions of the Policy shall have full force
      and effect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the Endorsement appears to state that the terms of the Policy apply “[e]xcept
    as otherwise provided in” the Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge concluded that s. 22 of the Endorsement failed to incorporate
    the territorial limitation set out in the Policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    coming to that conclusion, the motion judge distinguished the “[e]xcept for” language
    in the Endorsement from the language considered in <i>Pickford Black Ltd.
    v. Canadian General Insurance Co.</i>,<i> </i>[1977] 1 S.C.R. 261.  In <i>Pickford</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada held that wording making an endorsement “subject
    to” a policy’s limitations had effectively incorporated the relevant terms
    of the policy into the endorsement.  In this case, the motion judge held
    the view that, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this change form” was not
    sufficient to conclude that the Policy was the dominant document over the
    Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of her interpretation, the motion judge relied on <i>Szela v. Gore
    Mutual Insurance Co.</i>,<i> </i>[1987] O.J. No. 1047 (H.C.J.).  In that
    case, Austin J. found that the words “[e]xcept as otherwise provided” did
    not succeed in incorporating the policy’s quantum maximum into the endorsement
    because the endorsement was “almost a self-contained code and policy”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the motion judge reasoned in this case that the absence of express language
    about a territorial limitation “left the question in a state of ambiguity” and
    that principles of insurance contract interpretation required her to resolve
    that ambiguity in favour of the insured.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, I am unable to agree with the analysis of the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, on a plain reading, s. 22 of the Endorsement incorporates the territorial
    limitation set out in s. 1.2 of the Policy because the Endorsement specifically
    provides that the limits in the Policy are in full force and effect “[e]xcept
    as otherwise provided in this change form”.  Since the Policy explicitly
    sets out a territorial limitation, and the change form or Endorsement does
    not set out a territorial limitation, it follows that the Policy’s territorial
    limitation governs. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike
    the motion judge, I do not see a significant difference between the “[e]xcept
    as otherwise provided” language employed in the Policy in this case and the “[s]ubject
    to all … limitation[s]”
    terminology employed in the policy in <i>Pickford</i>.  Both clauses adequately
    express the same goal:  the provisions of the Policy govern unless the Endorsement
    provides otherwise or, to put it the other way, the provisions of the Endorsement
    are subject to the limitations in the Policy.  Thus, the Endorsement, aptly
    entitled the “<u>Change</u> Form”, may change the Policy, but only to the
    extent set out in the Endorsement.  Since, in my view, <i>Pickford’s</i> reasoning
    applies to this case, the territorial limitation in the Policy must be read
    as though it forms part of the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded to a contrary conclusion by <i>Szela, supra</i>, where Austin
    J. referred to a predecessor of the Endorsement as “almost a self-contained
    code and policy.”  That description of an underinsured endorsement was given
    in the context of circumstances quite different from those in this case.  In <i>Szela</i>,
    the court considered an apparent conflict between the endorsement’s $1,000,000
    underinsured motorist coverage and limits on the quantum of coverage for
    uninsured motorist coverage contained in the policy.  Austin J. correctly
    concluded that the specific wording of the endorsement dealing with a specific
    change in coverage trumped the conflicting wording of the policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considering
    his reasons in their entirety, I read Austin J.’s reference to a self-contained
    code, to say no more than that an endorsement dealing with a specific subject
    matter can “change” the terms of the original policy.  <i>Szela</i> turned
    not on what policy terms were incorporated into the endorsement, but rather
    on what the endorsement
    “otherwise provided”.  In any event, I do not read <i>Szela</i> as holding
    that an endorsement is a self-contained policy for all purposes; indeed,
    Austin J. restricted his statement about a self-contained code to <i>Szela’s</i> facts
    by adding the words “insofar as the present question is concerned”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>In any event,</span> in my view, an endorsement is generally not understood
    to be a self-contained policy.  As I have noted, the title of the Endorsement
    describes it as a “change form”.  An endorsement changes or varies or amends
    the underlying policy.  While it may be comprehensive on the subject of the
    particular coverage provided in the endorsement, it is built on the foundation
    of the policy and does not have an independent existence.  In any event,
    the Endorsement in this case is clearly not a stand-alone policy because
    it specifically provides that the policy terms remain in full force and effect,
    unless its terms are changed by the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge was influenced by the fact that other provisions
    of the Endorsement refer to jurisdictional limitations, while the insuring
    provision of the Endorsement does not.  For example, while the Endorsement
    specifically precludes coverage for certain accidents that occur in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec, the coverage section of the Endorsement simply provides indemnification
    related to an inadequately insured motorist without specifying any territorial
    restriction.  However, in my view, this reasoning is not available because
    it ignores the specific “[e]xcept as” wording of s. 22 of the Endorsement.  In
    light of s. 22, it was unnecessary to repeat the territorial limitation for
    coverage in the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    I conclude that the insurance contract is clear on its face, it is unnecessary
    to consider tools of insurance interpretation designed to resolve any ambiguity.  In
    my view, however, the interpretation adopted in these reasons is a logical
    one that accords with the reasonable expectations of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that since the release of the motion judge’s decision in this case,
    another Superior Court judge has determined that the Policy’s territorial
    limitation applies to underinsured coverage.  In <i>Radu v. Hartford Fire
    Insurance Co</i>., [1997] O.J. No. 6356 (Gen. Div.), Morin J. considered
    the applicability of an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario policy’s territorial limitation on a family protection endorsement.  In
    circumstances very similar to those in the case before this court, the motion
    judge in <i>Radu</i> rejected the argument that a person who purchases such
    an endorsement is entitled to worldwide coverage because such coverage “clearly
    flies in the face” of the territorial limitation plainly set out in the policy.  I
    agree.</p>

    2001, this court determined in <i>Ortiz v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance
    Co.</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 27, that the territorial restriction of s. 243(1),
    which was reflected in the insurance policy in that case, applied to preclude
    coverage with respect to an uninsured automobile.  Although s. 243(1) did
    not specifically refer to s. 265, s. 265(1) provided that coverage regarding
    an uninsured automobile is subject to the limits prescribed by Regulation.  Section
    10 of the <i>Uninsured Automobile Coverage Regulation</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    676 explicitly provided that the general provisions of the policy govern
    the recovery of benefits under s. 265(1).  For this reason, Sharpe J.A. concluded
    that there was no ambiguity or conflict between the policy limitation and
    the terms of the legislation.  The territorial limitation applied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After <i>Ortiz</i>,
    s. 243(1.1) of the Act was enacted to specifically extend the territorial
    limitation to s. 265 coverage dealing with uninsured or unidentified vehicles.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the same reasoning applies to underinsured coverage
    because that coverage is only a subset of uninsured coverage.  In other words,
    too little coverage is a subset of having no coverage.  However, this court
    noted in <i>Chomos v. Economical Mutual Insurance
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Co<span style='font-style:normal'>.</span><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [2002] O.J. No. 3164 at para. 35, that there are
    important distinctions between uninsured and underinsured coverage:  </span></i></p>
  <p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Underinsured motorist coverage is different,
      and separate, from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario's compulsory uninsured motorist coverage. It is available only at
    additional premium cost, on election by the consumer. It is concerned with
    an insured motorist's shortfall in damages recovery, not recovery in the
    first instance.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Underinsured
    coverage is additional coverage provided by an insurer to a willing insured
    prepared to pay an additional premium.  Accordingly, in my view, underinsured
    coverage is not a subset of uninsured coverage, at least for the purpose
    of the issue raised on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have said, the appellant submits, since underinsured coverage is not dealt
    with by the Act at all, the insurer is at liberty to offer additional coverage
    to an insured that is subject to a territorial limitation.  The respondents
    argue, however, that because the Act permits a territorial limitation only
    for third party, uninsured and unidentified driver coverage, by implication
    such a limitation is not available for underinsured coverage, or at least
    the Act is ambiguous about whether such a limitation is available.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    as I have pointed out, there is a fundamental difference between underinsured
    motorist coverage on the one hand and uninsured or unidentified motorist
    coverage on the other.  Underinsured coverage, which the parties agree has
    been offered by insurers for more than twenty years, is extra coverage not
    mandated by the Act.  It is coverage that goes above and beyond the basic
    coverage that the Act requires must be provided by insurers for insureds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the Act does not address underinsured coverage, automobile insurance in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario is regulated by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO).  No
    insurer is permitted to make a contract of insurance inconsistent with the
    Act (s. 126(1)) or to use a form of policy or endorsement unless that form
    has been approved by the Superintendent of FSCO (s. 227(1)).  Accordingly,
    even though underinsured coverage is not regulated by the Act, the form of
    endorsement providing that coverage is a FSCO-approved standard industry-wide
    contract that permits little, if any, scope for amendment.  Subject to that
    oversight, insurers are not precluded from offering additional underinsured
    or other optional coverage (with or without territorial limits) to their
    insureds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    absence of regulation for underinsured coverage was recently discussed in <i><span
lang=EN-US>LaPierre v. General Accident Assurance Co. of Canada</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    [2007] N.S.J. No. 12 (N.S.S.C.), where, regarding the Nova Scotia legislation,
    Warner J. explained at para. 35:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Act and Regulations stipulate the minimum requirements
    for, and in instances such as auto policies approval of the form of, policies,
    but legislation has not removed the ability of insurers to offer coverage
    that is beyond the requirements of legislation, such as, in this case, contained
    in the Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the Act neither precludes additional underinsured coverage nor prohibits
    a territorial limitation, at most it can be said that the Act is silent on
    the issue.  In this case, silence does not amount to a conflict.  There is
    no reason to infer that a territorial limitation is prohibited for underinsured
    coverage from the fact that one is mandatory for uninsured and unidentified
    coverage.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with Warner J. in <i>LaPierre, supra</i>, at para. 38, who could “not
    accept, as a principle of statutory interpretation that, because the Act
    mandates that third party liability (Section A) coverage shall be subject
    to a territorial limit, the SEF 44 Endorsement coverage cannot include a
    territorial limit”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in my view, the provisions of the Policy impose a permissible territorial
    limitation on the coverage provided by the Endorsement.  That limitation
    is not in conflict with the provisions of the Act.  There is no ambiguity. </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    concluding, I pause to recognize that Mr. Sutherland suffered very tragic
    consequences as a result of the accident in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    and it is regrettable that he does not have coverage for the extent of his
    injuries.  However, in my view, coverage is simply not available on the explicit
    terms of the Policy and the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I conclude that the territorial limit in the Policy applies to the
    Endorsement by virtue of the plain and unambiguous language set out in both
    documents, which together evidence the complete insurance contract.  As well,
    the inclusion of a territorial limit on underinsured coverage does not conflict
    with the provisions of the Act. </p>

    I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and declare that the
    OPCF 44R Endorsement does not provide coverage, subject to its terms and
    conditions, for the accident that occurred in Jamaica on December 31, 2001
    and further declare that the appellant is not required to indemnify the respondents
    for any amounts that the drivers of the vehicles (Ian Hogg and Leon Hinds)
    are legally required to pay.   </p>
