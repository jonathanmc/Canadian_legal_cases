style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    these appeals, the appellants argue that there was not the necessary “scintilla” of
    evidence of planning and deliberation on which to base their committals for
    first degree murder.  Their argument is based primarily on the intervening
    act of the victim’s colleague, Mr. Estephan, who - within seconds of their
    arrival at the scene - opened fire on the appellants.  They say one cannot
    use the fact of the murder linked with the events that occurred before that
    shooting, to found the inference of planning and deliberation, because it
    was that shooting that caused the three appellants to follow the victim and
    kill him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    well, the appellants argue that the circumstances contradicted planning and
    deliberation because the altercation took place in broad daylight in a very
    public place with none of the appellants attempting to disguise their identities.  Further,
    they argue, the victim did not initially appear to be intimidated by the
    appellants and, moments before his death, he was recorded behaving in an
    apparently nonchalant manner.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the evidence at the preliminary inquiry also showed, 1) extensive communication
    prior to the arrival of the appellants at the scene, 2) the appellants arrived
    in close convoy, 3) they exited their cars in rapid fashion and left some
    car doors open with some engines running, 4) the Dadshanis, Echrif and, inferentially,
    Abed were all armed, and 5) other lethal weapons were located in the cars.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the appellants did not immediately shoot the victim, as counsel argues they
    could have, they rushed, armed, towards the victim and immediately engaged
    in aggressive conduct, even before Mr. Estephan employed his gun.  When Echrif
    employed his gun, in response, Wahab Dadshani, Tawab Dadshani and Tarik Echrif,
    armed with a knife, a gun, and a sword, continued their pursuit of the victim
    and, within minutes, the victim suffered multiple injuries resulting in his
    death, including injuries inflicted by the sword.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence, taken together, can clearly support an inference of planning and
    deliberation to murder.  It is not a necessary inference, but it is an available
    inference.  There is no missing link in the chain of inferences from the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants Fahim Payman., Shawn Hulbert and Mohammed Abed remained outside
    the building in which the killing occurred.  Fahim Payman, the driver of
    the third vehicle, remained in his car throughout.  However, he communicated
    with Wahab Dadshani before the appellants’ arrival at the scene and went
    to Mohammed Abed’s aid after Mohammed Abed was shot.  Shawn Hulbert was apparently
    unarmed.  However, he followed Wahab Dadshani, Tawab Dadshani and Tarik Echrif
    in advancing towards the victim, until he took cover during the Estephan
    shooting.  Mohammed Abed, who inferentially was carrying an asp, was shot
    in the ankle by Mr. Estephan while rushing towards the altercation at the
    top of the stairs.  Although Fahim Payman., Shawn Hulbert and Mohammed Abed
    remained outside during the fatal altercation with the victim inside the
    Midway, there was evidence that they were aware of the plan and that they
    participated in its initial stages.  As such, they were properly committed
    as parties. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    jury may conclude whether the Estephan shooting changed the dynamic and how,
    if at all, that impacted on the intentions of the various appellants.  However,
    in careful and comprehensive reasons, the preliminary inquiry judge concluded
    that there was evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could draw
    the inference that the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the
    appellants.  This inference was available on the evidence of the communications,
    the convoy, the rapid exiting, the manner of stopping the vehicles, the rushing
    towards the victim, the carrying of lethal weapons, and the nature of the
    attack.  The preliminary inquiry judge’s decision was upheld by the Superior
    Court, also in careful and comprehensive reasons.  We see no basis on which
    to interfere with their analyses or conclusions.</p>
