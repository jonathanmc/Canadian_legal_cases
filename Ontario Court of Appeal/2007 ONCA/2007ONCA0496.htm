style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of first degree murder in November 2001.  The murder
    occurred in early June 1999 and the appellant was arrested in September 1999.  He
    has been in custody since then.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    March 2007, this court dismissed the appellant’s appeal from his conviction
    on the first degree murder charge, but substituted a conviction for second
    degree murder.  The parties agreed that this court should fix the period
    of parole ineligibility required upon the conviction for second degree murder.  In
    oral argument, the Crown suggested a fifteen-year parole ineligibility order.  Counsel
    for the appellant suggested it should not be more than twelve years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reading the written submissions of counsel, the material filed by counsel
    and hearing further oral argument, the court fixed the period of parole ineligibility
    at twelve years with reasons to follow.  These are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts surrounding the murder are set out in the reasons of this court on
    the conviction appeal released on March 22, 2007.  As the appellant has been
    in custody on the murder charge since September 1999, his period of parole
    ineligibility runs from that date.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    744 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> speaks to the factors to be considered in
    fixing the period of parole ineligibility upon a conviction for second degree
    murder.  These factors are:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    character of the accused;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    nature of the offence;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    jury’s recommendation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no jury recommendation in this case since the jury convicted of first
    degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding the offence can be
    considered together.  This offence occurred in the context of ongoing negotiations
    concerning a drug debt apparently owed by the appellant and his father, both
    of whom were drug dealers, to certain “Colombians”.  The deceased was apparently
    involved in attempts to broker a deal between the appellant and his father
    and the Colombians.  The appellant and probably his father arranged a meeting
    with the deceased ostensibly to negotiate this settlement.  The appellant
    went to the meeting with a loaded handgun.  He also arranged for the meeting
    at a location where he could act without fear of anyone coming forward as
    a witness against him.  The deceased was shot within ten minutes of his arrival
    at the meeting.  He was shot seven times.  The first shot hit him in the
    back, but likely did not kill him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence leaves no doubt that the appellant intended to kill the deceased.  It
    also suggests that the appellant went to the meeting appreciating that gunplay
    was a real possibility and that he might use his weapon against the deceased.  There
    is nothing to support the conclusion that the appellant acted impulsively,
    in anger, or in response to any provocation by the deceased.  There is a
    strong sense that the shooting was a cold-blooded reaction to the appellant’s
    “business” problems.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission have
    aggravating features that call for a period of parole ineligibility beyond
    the minimum of ten years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    turn next to the appellant’s character.  We begin with the question of remorse.  The
    appellant, as is his right, has maintained his innocence throughout and continues
    to maintain his innocence.  It follows that he has shown no remorse and offered
    no explanation that might mitigate his actions.  We, of course, do not hold
    the appellant’s continued assertion of his innocence against him in any way.  It
    does, however, remove remorse as a potential mitigating consideration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was twenty years old when he murdered the deceased.  By all accounts,
    even those of his loved ones, the appellant was a lawless, violent person.  In
    addition to this murder, the appellant had shot and wounded another man about
    eighteen months before this homicide.  The appellant was never charged with
    any offence arising out of that shooting, but the details of it emerged as
    part of his fresh evidence application on his conviction appeal.  As a youth,
    the appellant had participated in a very serious abduction and assault.  He
    made his living as a drug dealer and was a part of the criminal subculture.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s criminal lifestyle and his demonstrated willingness to use firearms
    to further his criminal purposes marked him as a very dangerous person in
    1999, despite his youth.  Were we considering his character as of the date
    of this offence (June 1999), it would be a very aggravating factor on sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant is now twenty-eight going on twenty-nine.  He has been in custody
    for almost eight years.  By all accounts, he is not the same person he was
    in 1999.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant now has the support of a loving wife and family, many of whom have
    attested to the fundamental change that has occurred in the appellant during
    his incarceration.  The appellant is now interested in furthering his education,
    working for a living, and raising a family.  According to his family members,
    a life of crime has lost its allure for the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his incarceration, the appellant has finished high school and taken some
    additional courses.  He has developed significant work skills and gained
    personal insight into his prior behaviour.  The appellant has found spiritual
    comfort and support in the Catholic church.  He has helped and mentored others
    while in custody.  The appellant has no record of any significant disciplinary
    offences while in custody and has been moved to medium security.  We are
    told that it is only the length of his sentence which prevents a further
    move to minimum security.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court must always be concerned about the <i>bona fides</i> of rehabilitation
    while incarcerated.  Sometimes, that rehabilitation will prove illusory when
    an individual leaves the controlled confines of the institution and returns
    to his former habitat.  There is, however, good reason for optimism in this
    case.  The appellant has shown real and continued progress for over eight
    years.  At least part of that time has been spent in a prison environment
    that was not conducive to rehabilitation.  The appellant also has the strong
    support of his wife and family.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    744 speaks to the character of the accused at the time of sentencing.  The
    appellant’s antecedents certainly reveal the potential for dangerous criminal
    conduct.  However, his development over almost eight years diminishes that
    potential and suggests a real potential for rehabilitation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is our view that taking into account that rehabilitative potential, but bearing
    in mind the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding the crime
    that an appropriate period of parole ineligibility is twelve years.  It will
    be for the Parole Board to ultimately determine when, if ever, the appellant
    should be released.  No doubt, it will closely examine any proposed release
    plan at the appropriate time.  </p>
