    appellant corporations (the “appellants”) claimed to have reached a settlement
    of litigation arising out of a contractual dispute with the respondent, Merrill
    Lynch Canada Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”).  Pursuant to rule 49.09 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, the appellants moved for judgment in the terms of
    the settlement.  Merrill Lynch resisted the motion, claiming that no final
    settlement had been reached by the parties.  The motion judge dismissed the
    appellants’
    motion.</p>

    appellants appealed the order dismissing their motion to this court.  Prior
    to the date scheduled for oral argument, the court, through its senior legal
    officer, wrote to counsel raising the question of this court’s jurisdiction
    to hear the appeal.  This court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal if the
    order under appeal is final:  <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.43, s. 6(1)(b).  However, if the order under appeal is interlocutory,
    this court has no jurisdiction and the appellants’ appellate remedy lies
    in an application for leave to appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court:  <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, s. 19(1)(b).  Counsel for
    the appellants took the position that the order was final and providing the
    court with authority for that position.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> When
    the appeal came on for oral argument, the court asked for submissions on
    the jurisdictional issue.  Counsel for the appellants reiterated the position
    taken in earlier correspondence and referred the court to some additional
    authority.  Counsel for the respondent agreed with the position taken by
    counsel for the appellant.  The court reserved on the jurisdictional question,
    heard argument on the merits of the appeal, and reserved judgment.    </p>

    court must decide the question of jurisdiction on its merits even though
    counsel for both parties are prepared to acknowledge and accept the jurisdiction
    of this court.  Despite the able arguments of counsel, I am satisfied that
    the order under attack is interlocutory.  This court has no jurisdiction
    to entertain the appeal.  I would quash the appeal.</p>

    is unnecessary to go into the facts underlying this appeal in any detail.  It
    is sufficient to indicate that a dispute arose between the appellants and
    Merrill Lynch over the interpretation of certain contractual provisions relating
    to the quantification of fees to be paid by the appellants to Merrill Lynch.  In
    October 2003, the appellants commenced legal action seeking, in effect, an
    interpretation of the contested provisions in the contracts.  A year and
    a half of settlement discussions and mediation followed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 2005, after lengthy negotiations, the appellants circulated a draft
    settlement agreement in the form of proposed amendments to the terms of the
    existing contracts.  The amendments were intended to clarify the basis upon
    which Merrill Lynch’s fees would be calculated.  The circulation of the draft
    agreements led to further discussions between the parties.  The drafts were
    rewritten and re-circulated.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    May 2005, it seemed to those directly involved in the negotiations that an
    agreement in principle had been reached.  The appellants prepared settlement
    agreements reflecting the terms agreed upon by the negotiators as of early
    June 2005.  These agreements were forwarded to Merrill Lynch for confirmation.  After
    some delay, in August 2005, Merrill Lynch advised the appellants that the
    terms set out in the settlement agreements sent to them in June 2005 were
    not acceptable.  </p>

    appellants moved for judgment under rule 49.09.  They argued that those who
    negotiated on behalf of Merrill Lynch had actual, or alternatively, ostensible
    authority to bind Merrill Lynch.  The appellants contended that the negotiators
    had agreed to a settlement in the terms of the documents circulated in June
    2005.  The appellants further submitted that Merrill Lynch had reneged on
    the settlement agreement because somebody at a senior management level in
    Merrill Lynch had balked at the amount that Merrill Lynch would have to pay
    to the appellant from funds being held by it pending resolution of the dispute  </p>

    Lynch submitted those negotiating for the appellant were told and knew full
    well that any agreement in principle reached by Merrill Lynch’s negotiators
    would have to be approved by senior business management personnel at Merrill
    Lynch before there was a binding agreement.  Merrill Lynch contended that
    all of the negotiations were carried out on that basis and that while the
    negotiators ultimately came to terms, no settlement was reached because the
    settlement proposed was rejected by senior management at Merrill Lynch.  </p>

    motion judge reviewed the affidavits of a Mr. Cruickshank and Ms. Alexander.  The
    former was the chief negotiator for the appellants and the latter the chief
    negotiator for Merrill Lynch.  Neither affiant was cross-examined on his
    or her affidavit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge properly concluded that the terms of the purported settlement
    were not at issue between the parties.  The issue was whether a binding contract
    had been reached by the parties.  If the parties had reached an agreement,
    the terms of that agreement were as reflected in the agreements prepared
    by the appellants and sent to Merrill Lynch in 2005.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge summarized the evidence and identified the legal test to be
    applied when determining whether negotiations had culminated in a contractual
    relationship.  He then said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[32]     <u>In
      my view, the affidavit evidence of Ms. Alexander, <i>if accepted as true</i>,
      would mean that a reasonable person in Quadravest’s position [the manager
      of the appellants’ funds] would not have believed there to be a mutual
      intention that the “agreement” as of June 3, 2005 was to be a legally binding
      agreement.</u>  The parties would have thought that there was an agreement-in-principle
      and a <i>probable</i> “done deal”, but one still subject to the formal
      agreement of Merrill’s senior management, that is, management senior in
      authority to Ms. Alexander.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[33]     Considerable
    argument was advanced as to whether a final, binding settlement was, or was
    not, achieved by June 3, 2005 by looking to the correspondence between counsel.  <u>However,
    in my view, the evidentiary record neither confirms nor contradicts the statements
    of Ms. Alexander in paragraphs 7 and 24 of her affidavit as quoted above.</u>  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>[34]     The
      material facts as to whether there was a mutual intention to create a completed,
      legally binding settlement agreement as of June 3, 2005 (not subject to
      approval by the senior management or Merrill before being binding) is in
      dispute.  On the record before me, the determination of this issue turns
      upon findings as to credibility in respect of Ms. Alexander.  I cannot
      make any findings in this regard on the basis of mere affidavit evidence
      (let alone affidavit evidence that is not contradicted by cross-examination).</u> [Italics
      in original.]  [Underlining added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    passages make it clear that the motion judge was not prepared on the record
    before him to make a finding as to whether the settlement agreement did or
    did not exist.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge went on, however, to conclude his analysis in these words:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[37]     In my
    view, and I so find, I cannot give summary judgment that there is a binding
    settlement agreement.  There is a genuine issue for trial in this regard.  <u>For
    the reasons given, the motion is dismissed.  The proceeding is continued
    as if there had been no accepted offer to settle.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Calce, counsel for the appellants, in an effective submission, fixes on this
    part of the motion judge’s reasons.  She submits that the last sentence must
    be taken as a finding by the motion judge that there was no settlement agreement.  She
    contends that this finding determines the question of the existence of the
    settlement agreement for the purposes of any litigation arising out this
    dispute.  She completes the circle of her argument by making the point that
    a finding that no settlement agreement exists is a determination of a substantive
    issue in the proceedings, thereby rendering the motion judge’s order dismissing
    the motion a final order for appellate purposes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am prepared to accept the premise of counsel’s submissions.  If the motion
    judge on a rule 49.09 motion finds as a fact that there was no settlement
    agreement, thereby determining that issue for the purposes of the litigation,
    an order dismissing the motion on that basis would be a final order.  I do
    not, however, read the passage relied on by the appellant – “the proceeding
    is continued as if there had been no accepted offer to settle” – as a finding
    by the motion judge that there was no settlement agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    phraseology used by the motion judge tracks the language of rule 49.09(b).  That
    provision allows a party to an accepted offer to settle to proceed as if
    there had been no settlement where the other party has not complied with
    the accepted offer.  Implicitly, the provision permits a court on a rule
    49.09 motion to conclude that despite the existence of an accepted offer
    to settle, the matter should proceed “as if there has been no accepted offer”.  The
    language of rule 49.09(b) requires the existence of an accepted offer, that
    is, a settlement agreement, and a determination that the settlement should
    not be enforced against a party to the settlement.  The discretion contemplated
    in rule 49.09(b) is exercised in a variety of circumstances, many of which
    are cases in which it would be fundamentally unfair to hold one party to
    the settlement bargain.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    the appellants nor Merrill Lynch suggested that there was any reason not
    to enforce a settlement agreement in favour of and against both parties if,
    in fact, a settlement agreement had been reached.  The possibility of continuing
    the proceedings “as if there had been no accepted offer to settle” was never
    an option.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretation urged on behalf of the appellants is also inconsistent with
    the rest of the paragraph in which the sentence is found.  In that paragraph,
    the motion judge states that there is a genuine issue as to whether there
    is a binding settlement agreement.  It is inconsistent to state on the one
    hand that the existence of the settlement agreement raises a genuine issue
    for trial and on the other hand to direct that the trial shall proceed as
    if that issue has been decided.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ interpretation of the phrase, and I repeat it again for convenience –“the
    proceeding is continued as if there had been no accepted offer to settle” – is
    also inconsistent with the analysis found in the rest of the trial judge’s
    reasons.  As described above, in paras. 32-34, the motion judge describes
    his inability to make a finding one way or the other on the question of the
    existence of a settlement agreement on the record before him.  The appellants’ interpretation
    of the later sentence in the reasons renders the analysis in paras. 32-34
    meaningless.  </p>

    jurisdiction, does no more than dismiss the motion.  There is nothing in
    the order directing that the trial should proceed on the basis that there
    was no settlement agreement.  The terms of the order do not support the appellants’ position.</p>

    think the motion judge dismissed the motion for judgment in the terms of
    the settlement agreement because he was unable to determine whether there
    was in fact a settlement agreement.  As he could not conclude there was “an
    accepted offer to settle”, he had no authority to make an order under either
    rule 49.09(a) or 49.09(b) and should have simply dismissed the motion.  In
    essence, and despite the reference at one point in his reasons to the language
    of rule 49.09(b), I think that is what the motion judge did.   </p>

    will briefly address the authorities put forward by counsel for the appellants.  Some
    orders made under rule 49.09 are final.  An order made under rule 49.09(a)
    granting judgment in the terms of the settlement is clearly a final order:
    see <i>Royal Bank of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    v. Central Canadian Industrial Inc.</i> (2003), 180 O.A.C. 275 (C.A.).  The

      v. Chertow</i> (2001), 146 O.A.C. 141, this court rejected an argument
      that an order dismissing a motion for judgment under rule 49.09 was interlocutory.  The
      court rejected the analogy between an order dismissing a motion for summary
      judgment and an order dismissing a motion for judgment under rule 49.09
      in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[2]       The
    main argument was that this motion for judgment on the settlement, when dismissed,
    can be likened to a dismissed summary judgment motion – the issues in the
    pleadings go forward for trial in both cases and the order has no impact
    upon the <i>lis</i> between the parties.  This argument overlooks the fact
    that a new <i>lis</i> was created by the alleged settlement, supervening
    the issues raised in the pleadings.  <u>That <i>lis</i> – was there a settlement? – has
    been fully and finally disposed of by the motion judge and will not go forward
    to trial.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

      motion judge appears to have decided both issues against the party moving
      for judgment.  In respect to whether an agreement had been reached, the

    a motion judge, on a rule 49.09 motion will be able on the record before
    him or her to come to a definitive conclusion as to the existence of the
    alleged settlement agreement.  Where the motion judge makes a determination
    as to the existence of the alleged agreement, the order should identify that
    finding.  In other cases, of which this case is an example, a motion judge
    will be unable, on the record before him or her, to decide one way or the

    distinction between final and interlocutory orders bedevils this court.  Far
    too much ink has been spilled over the pages of the Ontario Reports, grappling
    with this distinction.  Even when the parties themselves do not raise the
    issue, the court itself often feels compelled to do so – as it did in this
    case – because the court’s jurisdiction to hear an appeal turns on the distinction:
    final orders are appealable as of right to this court;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    yet, despite the very large number of decisions on whether a particular order
    is final or interlocutory, our court’s jurisprudence on the distinction has
    been anything but a model of consistency.  See Garry D. Watson &amp;
    Craig Perkins, <i>Holmested and Watson</i> <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i>,
    looseleaf, vol. 5 (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 1993) at 62-19 to 62-48.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    of that bar – cannot always fathom whether an order is final or not.  There
    is no better example than this case.  Two first-class advocates, Mr. Slaght
    for the appellants and Mr. Douglas for the respondent, came to this court
    because, in both their opinions, the order of the motion judge was a final
    order.  Even when pressed in oral argument, and even though it would have
    been very much in his client’s interest to take the position that the order
    under appeal was interlocutory,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    my opinion, the answer to this question is a close call, arguable on both

    my respectful view, we do not serve the parties or their counsel well by

    of the motion judge’s reasons suggest that his order is interlocutory.  Doherty
    J.A. has referred to those aspects.  To me, however, other aspects of the
    motion judge’s reasons suggest that his order is final.  I point out two.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the motion judge concludes his reasons, at para. 37, with these words: “<i>For</i><u> </u><i>the
    reasons given, the motion is dismissed</i>.  <i>The proceeding is continued
    as if there had been no accepted offer to settle</i>.” [Emphasis added].  As
    Doherty J.A. points out, these words seem inconsistent with the earlier part
    of the paragraph in which the motion judge says that whether there is a binding
    settlement agreement “is a genuine issue for trial”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
    what else can these italicized words mean but that this action must proceed
    on the basis that there is no settlement?  Despite what the motion judge
    said earlier in his reasons, the effect of these words is that the Funds
    cannot plead a settlement in this action.  Consistent with this meaning,
    the motion judge did not grant the Funds leave to amend their statement of
    claim to allege a settlement, or even direct the trial of an issue on whether
    the parties reached a settlement.  Thus, at least in this part of his reasons,
    the motion judge finally determined that for the purpose of this litigation
    there was no settlement.  This determination makes his order a final order.  Both
    counsel so interpreted his words.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second aspect of the motion judge’s reasons that argues for treating his
    order as a final order is seen in the substance of what he decided.  His
    statement that whether the parties reached a binding settlement raises a
    genuine issue for trial is itself based on a mistaken understanding of the
    Funds’ position.  The motion judge mistakenly believed that Quadravest challenged
    the credibility of a critical component of Merrill Lynch’s defence.  It did
    not.  Once that mistaken understanding is corrected and given effect to,
    there can be no doubt from the motion judge’s reasons that he found the parties
    had not reached a settlement agreement.  In substance, he finally determined
    that question.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the motion, Merrill Lynch filed the affidavit of Jacquie Alexander, Director
    and Global Risk Manager of the Global Markets
    &amp; Investment Banking Group of Merrill Lynch, who participated in the
    settlement discussions with Quadravest.  In her affidavit, she said that
    anything she agreed to in principle “required approval from senior management
    on Merrill’s business side, since they would be the ones most affected by
    the loss associated with any settlement.”  The motion judge seized on this
    statement in Ms. Alexander’s affidavit.  He examined the record on the assumption
    that her statement was true.  And, he concluded that if it were true, the
    record showed that the parties might have reached an agreement in principle,
    but not a final deal.  His conclusion is at para. 32 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[32] In my view,
    the affidavit evidence of Ms. Alexander, <i>if accepted as true</i>, would
    mean that a reasonable person in Quadravest’s position would not have believed
    there was a mutual intention that the ‘agreement’
    as of June 3, 2005 was to be a legally binding agreement.  The parties would
    have thought that there was an agreement-in-principle and a <i>probable</i> ‘done
    deal’, but one still subject to the formal agreement of Merrill’s senior
    management, that is, management senior in authority to Ms. Alexander.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the motion judge’s view of the record, senior management of Merrill Lynch
    had not given its approval.  Thus, if he accepted Ms. Alexander’s evidence
    that approval was needed, he was bound to conclude that the parties had not
    settled.  The only reason the motion judge could not decide whether the parties
    had or had not settled was because he could not determine the veracity of
    Ms. Alexander’s statement.  For him, this was an issue of credibility that
    could not be resolved on affidavit evidence:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[34] The material
    fact as to whether there was mutual intention to create a completed, legally
    binding settlement agreement as of June 3, 2005 (not subject to approval
    by the senior management of Merrill before being binding) is in dispute.  On
    the record before me, the determination of this issue turns upon findings
    as to credibility in respect of Ms. Alexander.  I cannot make any finding
    in this regard on the basis of mere affidavit evidence (let alone affidavit
    evidence that is not contradicted by cross-examination).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But,
    the credibility of Ms. Alexander’s statement was not in issue.  Although
    Peter Cruickshank, Quadravest’s Chief Financial Officer, disputed her affidavit
    evidence, for the purpose of the motion, Quadravest accepted that she made
    this statement and any agreement in principle was subject to the approval
    of Merrill Lynch’s senior management.  Quadravest argued that the correspondence
    showed that Merrill Lynch’s senior management had approved the agreement
    reached after lengthy settlement discussions, but later, after reassessing
    the settlement’s financial implications, reneged on the deal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    no issue of credibility arises on the motion or on the appeal.  Once the
    credibility of Ms. Alexander’s statement is accepted, the disagreement between
    Quadravest on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch and the motion judge on the
    other, turns on their respective assessments of the written record.  In substance,
    the motion judge has concluded that on the assumption Ms. Alexander’s statement
    is credible, the parties did not reach a binding settlement.  As Quadravest
    accepts that assumption, effectively the motion judge’s order finally determines
    the question of settlement.  In my view, we should treat the motion judge’s
    order as a final order appealable as of right to this court.</p>

    for a notional aggregate amount of $188 million, regardless of the market
    price of the basket of shares on that date.  In consideration for its agreement
    to purchase these shares, Merrill Lynch receives an annual fee, calculated
    as a percentage of the amounts owing under the contracts.  </p>

    Funds offer investors monthly redemption rights.  From the Funds’ perspective,
    redemptions by investors are involuntary.  The Funds have no control over
    the level of redemptions at any given time.  Redemptions, however, result
    in a liquidation or an “early termination” of a portion of the Funds’ portfolio
    and thus reduce the amount of the forwards.  Many investors have taken advantage
    of their redemption rights.</p>

    redemptions are not the only way to effect early partial termination of the

    the contracts to early termination of the forwards.  </p>

    question then became what amount was to be used to calculate Merrill Lynch’s
    annual fee.  The Funds took the position that under the contracts, early
    terminations would reduce Merrill Lynch’s fee because it could not claim
    fees on the amounts terminated.  Merrill Lynch took the position that under
    the contracts, early terminations did not affect its fees; it was still entitled
    to fees on the amounts of the early terminations.</p>

    October 2003, the Funds brought this litigation, seeking declaratory relief

    significant amount of money is at stake.  At the date of the motion, Merrill
    Lynch claimed $800,000 in fees, which would otherwise be payable to the Funds’
    investors.  That amount continues to increase.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Broadly
    speaking, three legal principles come into play on the merits of the appeal:
    the test for determining whether the parties reached a settlement; the test
    on a Rule 49 motion; and deference.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    a settlement is a contract.  To form a contract, the parties must mutually
    intend to create a binding agreement.  The test is objective: would a reasonable
    person in Quadravest’s position believe that the parties reached a settlement?  See
    S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 5th ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    Law Book, 2005) at 103.  This is the test the motion judge said that he applied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in applying this test, the motion judge used summary judgment principles
    under Rule 20 to the Rule 49 motion.  He said, at para. 30, that “[t]he plaintiff’s
    motion is in reality a summary judgment motion under Rule 20.01(1) in asserting
    that there is a binding legal settlement contract and, therefore, Rule 40.09
    is operative.”  He then applied Rule 20 and held that there is a genuine
    issue for trial whether the parties settled.  Nonetheless, in dismissing
    Quadravest’s motion, he also granted relief under rule 49.09(b) by holding
    that the action should continue as if there had been no offer to settle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its factum, Quadravest raised the question whether summary judgment principles
    should apply on a rule 49.09 motion.  I do not think that question needs
    to be firmly decided on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a motion under rule 49.09 to enforce a settlement, the court must address
    two issues: the threshold issue is whether there is an accepted offer to
    settle; and if there is, the second issue is whether the court should exercise
    its discretion to enforce that settlement.  See <i>Milios</i> <i>v. Zagas</i> (1998),
    38 O.R. (3d) 218 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Only the first issue arises on this appeal.  If the parties did reach
    a binding settlement, the court should enforce it; no principled reason exists
    to exercise its discretion not to.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the threshold issue, instead of referring to Rule 20 principles, I think
    the preferable approach is for the motion judge to look at all the evidence
    and ask whether the parties reached a binding agreement.  If the motion judge
    cannot answer this question because, for example, an important credibility
    issue arises that cannot be resolved, then the motion should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    I do not view the motion judge’s dismissal of Quadravest’s motion to be a
    discretionary decision.  I do, however, see it as a decision to which the
    principle of appellate deference applies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the literal sense, the motion judge did not make a finding of fact to which
    we need defer.  His decision is conditioned on his acceptance of Ms. Alexander’s
    evidence for the purpose of the motion.  The motion judge reasoned that if
    her evidence was accepted, there was no settlement.  As I have said, in his
    view, her evidence raised an issue of credibility that he could not resolve
    on the motion.  However, for the purpose of the motion and this appeal, Quadravest
    also accepts Ms. Alexander’s evidence.  So the credibility of her statement,
    in reality, is not in issue.  Because of Quadravest’s position, the condition
    on which the motion judge based his decision can be treated as a fact.  Therefore,
    I treat as a finding of fact, the motion judge’s finding, at para. 32, that “a
    reasonable person in Quadravest’s position would not have believed there
    was a mutual intention that the
    ‘agreement’ as of June 3, 2005 was to be a legally binding agreement.”  That
    finding then attracts the usual appellate deference.  It should not be overturned
    unless it is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.  See <i>H.L</i>. <i>v.

    breakthrough in the settlement negotiations came after the first mediation
    session.  As a way to resolve the impasse over its fees and achieve a compromise,
    Merrill Lynch suggested a settlement based on a distinction between terminations
    initiated by Quadravest (voluntary terminations) and terminations brought
    about by investor redemptions (involuntary redemptions).  Merrill Lynch would
    be compensated for fees lost by voluntary terminations but not by involuntary
    redemptions.  Quadravest accepted this distinction proposed by Merrill Lynch
    as the conceptual basis for a settlement.  Using that concept as the basis
    for an agreement, the parties then negotiated the details.</p>

    in which Mr. Penny confirms that a binding settlement had been reached.  He
    wrote, “I believe this resolves all outstanding matters.  Can you prepare
    a revised agreement for final review and approval by all parties?”  In my
    opinion, a reasonable person in Quadravest’s position would conclude that
    the parties had reached an agreement on the essential terms and therefore
    had a binding settlement agreement.  See <i>Bogue v. Bogue</i> (1999), 46

    need for the highest levels of management at head office in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York to review, understand and approve this settlement.</p>

    the motion and in this court, Merrill Lynch argued that its refusal to sign
    the agreements because its senior management in the New York office would
    not approve the settlement is entirely consistent with Ms. Alexander’s limitation
    on her authority, which she stipulated at the beginning of the negotiations:
    anything she “agreed to in principle required approval from senior management
    on Merrill’s business side”.  Merrill Lynch contended that its business side
    reserved the right not to approve any settlement and it exercised that right.  I
    do not accept this contention.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sophisticated
    parties represented by highly competent counsel – as these parties were – do
    not negotiate that way.  If any settlement negotiated in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Toronto required the approval of Merrill Lynch’s senior management on the
    business side in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York, one would reasonably have expected that added requirement to have
    been communicated to Quadravest.  It is nowhere to be found.  It is not in
    the agreements themselves, where one might logically expect it to be inserted.  It
    is not in any of the email correspondence from Merrill Lynch’s lawyers sent
    during the settlement negotiations.  It is not even in Ms. Alexander’s affidavit,
    in which she states that she told Mr. Cruickshank of her limited authority,
    and on which Merrill Lynch so heavily relies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    written record demonstrates that the approvals referred to in Ms. Alexander’s
    affidavit were being obtained throughout the negotiations.  Merrill Lynch’s
    lawyers communicated with Quadravest only after they had received their client’s
    business approval of each of the terms of the settlement.  All parties to
    the negotiations knew this.  When Mr. Penny signalled on May 17, 2005 that
    the last issue had been resolved, any objective observer would have taken
    his email at face value and concluded that the parties had a binding agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Long
    after the settlement was made and, unknown to its own counsel, Merrill Lynch
    claimed that any settlement required the approval of its senior management
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York.  It reneged on the settlement reached in May because apparently
    its
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York office thought that the settlement was too expensive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    that explanation rings hollow.  Merrill Lynch claimed that it had not appreciated
    that the level of involuntary redemptions was so high and that its fees were
    correspondingly so low.  However, Merrill Lynch was told the level of involuntary
    redemptions in September of 2004; it knew that the level was unpredictable
    and not in either side’s control; it knew that the level would necessarily
    increase with the passage of time; and it could have asked – but did not – about
    the level of redemptions at any time during the negotiations.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is
    that the requirement for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    New York senior management approval was a pretext proffered by Merrill Lynch
    because it had second thoughts about the deal it had agreed to.  As a matter
    of good policy, absent evidence of fraud, duress, mistake of fact or unconscionability,
    courts strive to uphold and enforce settlements.  See <i>Van</i> <i>Patter
    v.
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  When a settlement has been reached, courts ordinarily hold parties to
    their bargains, even in a case where one of the parties has second thoughts
    or enters into the agreement without fully appreciating all the consequences.<a href="#_ftn6"

    the reasons set out above, in my respectful opinion, the motion judge’s failure
    to find a concluded settlement was unreasonable.  I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the order of the motion judge, and grant judgment under rule 49.09
    in accordance with the unsigned, but agreed on, settlement agreements at
    tab 14 of Quadravest’s compendium.  I would award Quadravest its costs of
    the appeal, fixed in the amount of $25,000, all inclusive.</p>
