      trial, a number of witnesses testified as to K.M.s physical and mental

      was somewhat varied, and provided as follows. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      after K.M. began living with the Fiddlers, on May 2, 2000, Nurse Michelle
      De Coene conducted a physical examination of K.M. for Tikinagan Child and
      Family Services. The purpose of this examination was to document any injuries,
      determine any care needed, and to comment on the childs immunization status.
      During her examination, Nurse De Coene noticed nothing unusual  K.M. had
      no bruising, scrapes or cuts, his abdomen was soft, and the boy showed
      no indication of soreness or tenderness.</span></p>

      when K.M. stayed at the home of Rachel Gliddy a short time later between
      May 19 and May 26, 2000, Ms. Gliddy noticed a bruise in the middle of K.M.s
      forehead and scratches on top of his head. Although Ms. Gliddy saw K.M.
      without clothing, she did not see bruises on his body. Ms. Gliddy did not
      take K.M. to a doctor 
    or tell the appellant and Vanessa to do so  on account of these marks, but
    she was surprised when she saw them. She had not seen scratches like that
    before on a child and showed them to her sister. </span></p>

      Her husband bought K.M. a bicycle that he fell off of several times. She

      Keno, a friend of Vanessa, saw K.M. at the Fiddler home about a week before
      he died but did not notice that he had any injuries. She had, however,
      noticed a bruise extending across K.M.s face, from one cheek to the other,
      sometime in the month leading up to his death. </span></p>

      and K.M. on the Saturday before his death. Both women observed Vanessa
      call the boy stupid during this outing. Loretta considered this unusual
      because she did not normally hear Vanessa speak like that to people. Darlene
      also noted that Vanessa yelled at K.M. again when the group returned to
      the Fiddler residence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant admitted to seeing bruises on K.M.s legs, arms and chest area
      on the Thursday before his death and that K.M. had told him that the bruised
      areas all hurt. The appellant also described seeing a scratch on K.M.s
      penis on the Monday evening before his death. According to the appellant,
      when he asked K.M. about that scratch, the boy told him that the dog had
      bitten him. Notably, the medical evidence in this case suggested that this scratch was
      not caused by a dog bite. Rather, the scratch was described as a cut or
      a laceration. Dr. Deborah Lindsay, a pediatrician and expert in child
      abuse, testified that the cut on the penis was three to five days old while
      Dr. Nicolas Escot, a pathologist, estimated the wound to be at least one
      or two days old. Both Drs. Lindsay and Escot said that the wound was inconsistent
      with a dog bite because of its straight edges and the absence of other
      signs that they would expect from a dog.</span></p>

      June 20, 2000, the appellant brought K.M. to the Sandy Lake Nursing Station;
      he was not breathing and had no pulse. CPR and medications were immediately
      started. Although K.M.s heart started to beat for about two minutes, it
      then stopped and never resumed. K.M. was pronounced dead at 11:55 p.m.
      and resuscitation ceased.</span></p>

      efforts were being made to revive K.M., at least two of the nurses attending
      to him noted that he had bruises all over his body. Nurse De Coene  the
      same nurse that had noted nothing unusual with respect to K.M. less that
      two months earlier  observed bruises all over K.M.s body, face, neck,
      torso, arms, and legs. Nurse De Coene thought that these bruises varied
      in age. Further, Nurse De Coene observed that K.M. was pale, had an abrasion
      on one side of his neck, blueness around his lips, a slightly infected
      wound on the top of his foot, a swollen nose, dried blood at his right
      nostril, and that his foreskin was scraped. She said that she had never
      before been presented with a child in K.M.s condition and that she was shocked by
      it.</span></p>

      hours before K.M.s death.</span></p>

      cause of K.M.s death was determined to be multiple blunt trauma to the
      head which, essentially, caused acute hemorrhaging at different layers
      in the brains covering. His brain became so very swollen that it ceased
      to function. </span></p>

      William Halliday, a neuropathologist who testified at trial, estimated
      that the interval between K.M.s fatal injuries and his death was between
      two and three hours. According to Dr. Halliday, within ten minutes of suffering
      these types of head injuries, K.M. would have been crying, his level of
      consciousness would have been affected, he may have had a seizure, and
      he may have vomited. </span></p>

      addition to his multiple head traumas, K.M. suffered hemorrhaging in the
      small bowel. Significant force is required to cause this type of injury,

      given the acquittal on manslaughter by failing to provide the necessaries

      The Supreme Court of Canada most recently had occasion to consider this
      issue in <i>R. v. Pittiman</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 6 where Charron
      J. on behalf of the court said at pp. 10-11:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The onus of establishing that
      a verdict is unreasonable on the basis of inconsistency with other verdicts
      is a difficult one to meet because the jury, as the sole judge of the facts,
      has a very wide latitude in its assessment of the evidence. The jury is
      entitled to accept or reject some, all or none of a witnesss testimony.
      Indeed, individual members of the jury need not take the same view of the
      evidence so long as the ultimate verdict is unanimous. Similarly the jury
      is not bound by the theories advanced by either the Crown or the defence.
      The question is whether the verdicts are supportable on any theory of the
      evidence consistent with the legal instructions given by the trial judge.
      Martin J.A. aptly described the nature of the inquiry in <i>R. v. McShannock</i> (1980),
      55 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 56, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>Where on any realistic view
      of the evidence, the  verdicts cannot be reconciled on any rational or
      logical basis the illogicality of the verdict tends to indicate that the
      jury must have been confused as to the evidence or must have reached some
      sort of unjustified compromise. We would, on the ground that the verdict
      is unreasonable alone, allow the appeal, set aside the verdict, and direct
      an acquittal to be entered.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The search for a rational or logical
      basis for the verdicts does not mean that where a narrative of the events
      is not readily apparent from the jurys findings that the impugned verdict
      must necessarily be set aside as unreasonable. The jurys task is not to
      reconstruct what happened. Rather, it is to determine whether the Crown
      has proven each and every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
      Therefore, in the case of a single accused charged with multiple offences,
      different verdicts may be reconcilable on the basis that the offences are
      temporally distinct, or are qualitatively different, or dependent on the
      credibility of different complainants or witnesses. The strength of the
      evidence relating to each count may not be the same, leaving the jury with
      a reasonable doubt on one count but not on the other. <i>On the other hand,
      when the evidence on one count is so wound up with the evidence on the
      other that it is not logically separable, inconsistent verdicts may be
      held to be unreasonable.</i> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    MacFarland J.A.; however, I am unable to agree with her conclusion that the

    my colleague notes, <i>R. v Pittiman</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 6 (S.C.C.),
    is the leading authority on the issue of inconsistent verdicts. <span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>In that case,</span> Charron J. explained that the test for inconsistent verdicts
    is a strict one, which asks whether the verdicts are supportable on any
    theory of the evidence consistent with the legal instructions given by the
    trial judge.  In other words, are the verdicts irreconcilable such that
    no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could possibly have rendered them

    my view, the verdicts in this case cannot be said to be inconsistent because

    ease of reference, I repeat the two relevant sections of the <i>Criminal

    criminal negligence includes the essential element that the accused showed wanton

    see two important distinctions between the offences on the facts of this
    case. First, the Crown must prove the accuseds
    reckless disregard as an element of the offence of criminal negligence
    while the Crown must prove a failure to perform a duty to provide the necessaries
    of life. Second, the Crown must prove that the accuseds conduct related
    to the life or safety of the victim for criminal negligence, while it must
    prove that it was likely to cause the health of [the victim] to be endangered
    permanently for failing to provide the necessaries of life.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    concentrate on these distinctions because I agree with my colleague that
    the facts of this case raise no discernible differences regarding the other
    constituent elements of the two offences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the purposes of my reasons, it is unnecessary to review in detail the evidence
    that has already been amply reviewed by my colleague. In essence, the appellant,
    who acted as foster father for K.M., was present in the small family home
    when his wife, K.M.s foster mother, applied blunt force trauma to K.M.s
    head that resulted in his death. There is no allegation that the appellant
    at any time inflicted any direct injury to K.M. At the time the fatal injuries
    were inflicted, the appellant was apparently asleep in his bedroom and the
    weight of the evidence suggested that the appellant wakened after the injuries
    had been inflicted and when K.M. was no longer responsive. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown virtually conceded at trial that K.M.s death was not foreseeable by
    the appellant or anyone else who came in contact with the child in the days
    immediately before his death. The question for the jury, however, was whether
    the appellant should have anticipated the event, or some degree of danger
    for the child, and whether he should have intervened to protect K.M. from
    what happened. Specifically, the Crown submitted to the jury that while clearly
    the injuries [to K.M.] that were observed earlier  werent life threatening,
    they must have been observed by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the Crown submitted that a threat to K.M.s <b>safety</b> was foreseeable
    as was a threat that K.M.s <b>health</b> would be permanently endangered. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will deal first with the different conduct on the part of the appellant as
    an element of each charge and the element of the danger to K.M.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the distinction between the appellants conduct in relation to the two offences,
    the Crown addressed the appellants wanton or reckless disregard for the
    safety of K.M. in relation to the charge of criminal negligence. Immediately
    afterwards, the Crown submitted that failing to provide the necessaries of
    life required conduct by the appellant that showed a marked departure from
    the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent and that that failure was likely
    to cause the health of [K.M] to be permanently endangered.  The Crown repeated
    this distinction on more than one occasion, including at the end of its submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his submissions, the appellants counsel queried whether the Crown had proven
    pre-existing bruising and asked whether, in all the circumstances, the appellant
    should have been alerted to any danger to the child. He specifically asked
    the jury whether the appellants failure to take action would lead to a
    risk of danger of the life or a risk of permanent endangerment of the health
    of the child.  This submission by the defence drew a clear distinction for
    the jury between the two offences. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge not only told the jury about the differences between the two
    offences, but emphasized those differences by charging first on the elements
    of criminal negligence, then on the facts, and then on the elements of failing
    to provide the necessaries of life. On both counts, the trial judge referred
    to the foreseeability of the childs death, but as I have said, the Crown
    conceded that the childs death was not foreseeable so that the focus was
    on the perceived danger to K.M. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    criminal negligence, the trial judge told the jury to ask whether the appellant
    showed wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of K.M. and whether there
    was a discernible risk of more than trifling or short-lived bodily harm to
    the child. He then explained:  Wanton disregard means heedless disregard
    for the consequences of your failure to act. Reckless means showing indifference
    to the consequences of your failure to act.  He also told the jury to consider
    whether the conduct established criminal negligence, which required a marked
    and substantial departure from that of the reasonably prudent parent. This
    statement was immediately followed by this instruction:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Crown counsel may prove this in either of two ways:
    by proving that [J.F.] was aware of a danger or risk to the health
    or safety of [K.M.] but ignored that risk; or by proving that [J.F.]
    failed to direct his mind to the risk to the health or safety of [K.M.] which
    a reasonable parent would have understood. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    on this element, the trial judge referred again to whether the appellant
    recognized the risk to K.M. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dealing with the necessaries of life count, the trial judge referred specifically
    to the different wording for this offence and explained the necessary element
    that the Crown prove the appellants failure to provide the necessaries of
    life caused or was likely to cause [K.M.s] health to be permanently endangered and
    said this was about the foreseeability of the harm: Was it objectively foreseeable
    that the failure to provide necessaries of life would lead to <u>a risk</u> of
    danger to life, or <u>a risk</u> of permanent endangerment to the health
    of [K.M.]? [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significantly,
    however, in the post-charge conference, the Crown raised an objection to
    these words, particularly the words risk of. He suggested that risk of was
    not reflected in the words used by the <i>Criminal Code</i> and that
    risk of permanent endangerment was a less onerous test than likely to
    lead to permanent endangerment. Not surprisingly, the appellants trial
    counsel agreed that it was preferable to adhere to the precise wording of
    the section. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the trial judge called the jury back and asked the jury members
    to strike the words lead to a risk of danger to and in its place write
    the words, endanger the. He re-read the resulting instruction for the
    jury:  Was it objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide necessaries
    of life would endanger the life, or is likely to permanently endanger the
    health of [K.M.]. In this way, the distinction between the likelihood of
    harm in the two offences was highlighted for the jury with risk to K.M.
    restricted to the charge of criminal negligence. Thus, with the acquiescence
    of the defence at trial, the elements for criminal negligence were clearly
    distinguished from those for failing to provide K.M. with the necessaries
    of life. As I have said, appellants counsel does not impugn the correctness
    of the trial judges instructions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consistent
    with this distinction, the defence did not suggest to either the jury or
    the judge that a conviction on one count would inevitably involve a conviction
    on the other. To the contrary, the defence specifically told the jury that
    the Crown had to prove the appellant
    guilty of one of the two offences hes charged with.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the jury rendered its verdict, the defence raised the spectre of inconsistent
    verdicts. The Crown took the position that the jury was very alert to those
    two different tests and the trial judge commented that they were separate
    offences. The issue of potentially inconsistent verdicts was raised again
    on sentencing when defence counsel indicated he was having trouble with sentencing
    submissions because he was
    having some difficulty with his perception of inconsistent verdicts. To
    this, the trial judge  who was in the best position to understand the nuances
    of the evidence and his charge - responded, I am not.  In addition, the
    trial judge remarked in his reasons for sentence that the jury must have
    found that the appellant was aware of the risk to the health and safety
    of K.M., but that the appellant ignored or failed to direct his mind to that risk.
    This comment was in keeping with his charge to the jury that criminal negligence
    was proven if the appellant was aware of the risk and ignored it, or if the
    appellant failed to direct his mind to the risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, one explanation for the different verdicts was the element of risk in
    criminal negligence and the failure of the appellant to address his mind
    to that risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, there is a second reason why the verdicts have not been shown to
    be inconsistent. That reason lies in the distinction between safety and permanent
    endangerment to health. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    on some occasions, the trial judge referred to the danger of risk to the
    health or safety of the child in the portion of the charge dealing with
    criminal negligence, his charge on failing to provide the necessaries of
    life focussed on the childs health. Reading the submissions and the charge
    in their entirety, the jury would have considered safety in relation to
    criminal negligence and health in relation to failing to provide the necessaries
    of life. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Safety,
    as commonly understood, would include risk of injury of any kind, including
    the bruising and the laceration to the penis that were identified on K.M.s
    body. In contrast, health refers more often to the general condition of
    the body reflected in the expressions that one is in good health or poor
    health. Moreover, to have ones health
    permanently endangered imports an element of a condition that is indefinite
    in duration. The jury was entitled to conclude that there was a difference
    between K.M.s safety and permanent endangerment to his health. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the evidence in this case, it was open to the jury to conclude that bruising,
    even extensive bruising, was not likely to permanently endanger K.M.s health
    - at least his physical health - but that the bruising was sufficiently extensive
    to suggest child abuse of a nature to alert the appellant that K.M.s safety
    was at risk and he was reckless in ignoring that risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Although
    permanent endangerment of health could conceivably encompass the bruising
    established in this case, in my view it does not necessarily do so. The jury
    was entitled to exercise its common sense to conclude that the distinction
    between safety and health was determinative on the facts of this case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the constituent elements of the two offences charged were different in the
    respects I have discussed, I would conclude that the appellant has failed
    to satisfy the strict test for establishing inconsistent verdicts. The verdicts
    have not been shown to be irreconcilable such that no reasonable jury, properly
    instructed, could have rendered them on the evidence in this case. Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
