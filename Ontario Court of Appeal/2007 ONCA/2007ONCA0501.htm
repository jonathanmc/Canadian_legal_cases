  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      This appeal
    has a long and unusual history.  In 1999, a class action was certified on
    behalf of a large number of disabled World War I and II veterans whose pensions
    and allowances had been administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs
    (“DVA”).  The representative plaintiff, Joseph Authorson, claimed that the
    Crown breached its fiduciary duty to him and to other veterans by failing
    to invest or pay interest on pension funds administered by the Crown for
    their benefit.  The Crown argued that the action was barred by s. 5.1(4)
    of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1, as
    am. 1990, c. 43 (“<i>DVA Act</i>”), which provides that no claim shall lie “for
    or on account of interest” on monies held by the Department of Veterans Affairs
    prior to 1990.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      The class
    action was bifurcated on the issues of liability and damages.  The motion
    judge granted summary judgment in favour of the Class on the liability issue
    in 2000, declaring that the Crown had breached its fiduciary duty by failing
    to invest or pay interest on the funds, and that the statutory bar in s.
    5.1(4) of the <i>DVA Act</i> was inoperative because it conflicted with the <i>Canadian
    Bill of Rights</i>, S.C. 1960, c. 44.  This court affirmed that decision
    in 2002.  The motion judge proceeded to hear the damages portion of the action,
    but reserved his decision pending the Crown’s appeal to the Supreme Court
    of Canada from the liability judgment, which was heard in March 2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      Before
    the Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown conceded that it had breached its
    fiduciary duty, but submitted that s. 5.1(4) lawfully rendered the debt unenforceable.  The
    Supreme Court agreed and found that s. 5.1(4) was valid legislation that
    was not inconsistent with the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.  The Crown’s appeal
    was allowed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      One might
    have expected this to be the final word on the matter.  However, shortly
    after the Supreme Court released its decision, in the fall of 2003 the Class
    moved before the motion judge for judgment on damages.  The Class argued
    that the motion judge’s initial declaration that the Crown had breached its
    fiduciary duty had not been disturbed, and that the reach of both s. 5.1(4)
    and the Supreme Court’s decision were limited to “interest” as distinct from
    damages for failure to invest.  The motion judge agreed.  In doing so, he
    rejected the Crown’s submissions that he was <i>functus officio</i>, that
    the Class’s claim was barred by <i>res judicata</i> or issue estoppel, or
    that the claim was time-barred.  The motion judge then directed further hearings
    to determine the quantum of damages for the failure to invest the funds.  Those
    hearings were held over eight days in 2004 and 2005.  At the end of 2005,
    the motion judge released the final damages decision, in which he assessed
    the Class’s damages at more than $4.6 billion.  The Crown now appeals to
    this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      As we will
    explain more fully below, we agree with the Crown’s submission that the judgment
    of the Supreme Court was final and binding and that there was no basis in
    fact or law for the Class to pursue its claim, or any aspect of it, once
    that judgment had been rendered.  We also agree with the Crown’s submissions
    that properly interpreted,    s. 5.1(4) constitutes a complete bar to the
    claim, and that the motion judge erred by applying the doctrine of equitable
    fraud to overcome the Crown’s limitations defence.  Accordingly, we allow
    the appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <h2>Veterans’
    pensions and allowances</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      Since
    World War I, the Government of Canada has provided pensions and other financial
    benefits to veterans who were injured in service to their country.  These
    payments take a number of different forms, three of which are relevant to
    this appeal: (1) disability pensions for veterans who were physically or
    mentally disabled as a result of service, as authorized by the <i>Pension
    Act</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6 and its predecessors beginning in 1915; (2) treatment
    allowances for veterans receiving active medical treatment, as authorized
    by the <i>DVA Act</i> and its predecessors beginning in 1918; and (3) income
    supplements to indigent veterans who were injured in the theatre of war,
    as authorized by the <i>War Veterans Allowance Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. W-3
    and its predecessors beginning in 1930.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      For all
    three types of payments, legislation provided that when a veteran was deemed
    incapable of managing his own financial affairs, an administrator would be
    appointed to do so.  Where possible, a relative or close friend of the veteran
    was selected as the administrator.  If a suitable third-party administrator
    could not be found, the DVA assumed administration of the funds.  The veteran
    could regain control of the funds at any time if he became capable of managing
    his own affairs.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      When the
    DVA was designated as the administrator of a veteran’s funds, his cheques
    were made out to an official in the department and deposited in the Consolidated
    Revenue Fund.  For accounting purposes, the funds were tracked as if they
    were in a special purpose account held in the veteran’s name.  Occasionally,
    funds from private sources, such as inheritances, were also deposited.  The
    Crown acknowledged that in virtually all cases, DVA-administered funds were
    neither invested nor credited with interest until 1990, when the <i>DVA Act</i> was
    amended to authorize the payment of interest from that point forward.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      It was
    estimated that there were approximately 10,000 DVA-administered accounts
    in the 1970s and 1980s, but the number had dwindled to fewer than 1,000 by
    the time this litigation was commenced.  </p>
  <h2>The representative plaintiff</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Joseph
    Authorson enlisted in the Canadian Forces in 1939 at the age of twenty-five.  While
    on active service during World War II, he suffered a combat-related mental
    illness and spent most of the remainder of his life in a psychiatric hospital.  Authorson
    received a regular pension beginning in 1944, except for the periods of time
    when he received a treatment allowance.  The DVA held and administered both
    types of funds on his behalf.  In 1991, Authorson was deemed competent to
    manage his affairs and the DVA ceased to administer his funds.  The DVA’s
    records indicated that during the time it administered his account, Authorson’s
    accumulated pension and treatment allowance totalled $117,916 and his personal
    funds totalled $166,248.  Such figures were not unusual for veterans who
    had spent substantial amounts of time in hospital, and therefore had not
    incurred many expenses.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the time the DVA administered Authorson’s pension funds, the funds were held
    by the Crown in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.  Prior to 1990, it did not
    invest or pay interest on those funds.</p>
  <h3>Department of Veterans Affairs Act, s. 5.1(4)</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Guerin
    v. Canada</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335, the Supreme Court of Canada held that
    the Crown could be liable for breach of fiduciary duty.  This decision
    prompted the DVA to investigate the government’s potential liability for
    failure to invest or pay interest on the accounts under the DVA’s administration.  The
    issue became more public in 1985 when the Auditor General warned in a report
    that the department was “vulnerable to legal action” by veterans to recover “the
    difference between the amounts accumulated in the trust accounts and what
    would have been produced if the money had been properly invested.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1988, an internal government task force recommended that the government pay
    interest on administered accounts on a go-forward basis and set out a variety
    of options for dealing with any exposure to past liability.  One of those
    options was to enact legislation to eliminate any risk of liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Department
    of Veterans Affairs Act</i> implemented the task force’s recommendation
    by amending the <i>DVA Act</i> to authorize the monthly payment of interest
    on veterans’ accounts.  However, s. 5.1(4) of that Act made it clear that
    the entitlement to interest was strictly prospective.  That provision states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>No claim shall
    be made after this subsection comes into force for or on account of interest
    on monies held or administered by the Minister during any period prior to
    January 1, 1990 pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the <i>Pension Act</i>, subsection
    15(2) of the <i>War Veterans Allowance Act</i> or any regulations made under
    section 5 of this Act.</p>

    the Crown’s cross-motion: <i>Authorson v. Canada</i> <i>(Attorney General) </i>(2000),
    53 O.R. (3d) 221 (S.C.J.) (“2000 liability decision”).  He found, at para.
    28, that by undertaking to administer the funds on the veterans’ behalf,
    the Crown became “at least a fiduciary, subject to the obligations imposed
    on individuals in that capacity by the law of equity.”  The motion judge
    concluded that the Crown was obliged to invest or pay interest on the veterans’ funds
    while they were under the DVA’s administration.  </p>

    inoperative because it was inconsistent with ss. 1(a) and 2(e) of the <i>Bill
    of Rights</i>.  In so finding, at para. 98 the motion judge described s.
    5.1(4) as a “pernicious subsection”, the “only objective” of which is to “block
    legitimate potential claims by veterans”.</p>

    paid to and administered by the DVA;</p>
  <p>2.   The Crown was a fiduciary to the class members during the time that
    the class members’ funds were being paid to and administered by the DVA;</p>
  <p>3.   The Crown breached its duty as a fiduciary by failing to invest or
    pay interest on the funds under administration;</p>
  <p>4.   Section 9 of the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</i> does not
    bar or exempt the claims of the class members;</p>
  <p>5.   Section 5.1(4) of the <i>DVA Act</i> does not bar or exempt the claims

    v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.). The court
    held that the Crown was under a fiduciary duty to grow the veterans’ funds
    by investing them or accruing interest on them, and that it had breached
    this duty by failing to invest or pay interest on the funds under its administration.  This
    court also held, at para. 98, that
    “[s.]&nbsp;5.1(4) purports to prohibit the bringing of this action” but that
    the section was inoperative because it deprived the veterans of their property
    without any process or hearing, contrary to ss. 1(a) and 2(e) of the <i>Bill
    of Rights</i>.  </p>

    the Class did not cross-appeal on the question of whether s. 5.1(4) violated
    the <i>Charter</i>, the court heard submissions from counsel on this issue.  However,
    since the court ultimately decided the <i>Bill of Rights</i> issue in the

    to invest or pay interest on their accounts.  The Crown based its appeal
    exclusively on the argument that both the motion judge and this court had

    noted that the <i>Bill of Rights</i> only protects those rights that existed
    at the time of its passage in 1960, and that then, as today, Parliament had
    the right to expropriate property if it made its intention clear.  Major
    J. held, at paras. 56-57, that Parliament’s intent to expropriate the veterans’ property
    was “clear and unambiguous”, and that s. 5.1(4), “leaves no doubt that the
    respondent has no claim for interest.”  Rather, at para. 62 he found that
    “Parliament has chosen for undisclosed reasons to lawfully deny the veterans,
    to whom the Crown is owed a fiduciary duty, these benefits whether legal,
    equitable or fiduciary.”</p>

    a veteran’s estate upon his death.  However, he noted that in 1986 the <i>Pension
    Act</i> was amended to allow veterans’ pension funds to be paid to their
    estates.  No parallel amendment was made to deal with treatment allowances
    under the <i>Veterans Treatment Regulations</i>.  Accordingly, he concluded
    that s. 55 of the <i>Veterans Treatment Regulations</i> was <i>ultra vires </i>by

    Court of Appeal released its judgment upholding the liability decision in
    March 2002.  The parties argued the damages issue before the motion judge
    over five days in March 2003.  The motion judge reserved his decision pending
    the Crown’s appeal to the Supreme Court, which was heard in April 2003.  The
    Supreme Court released its judgment allowing the Crown’s appeal in July 2003.  In
    October of that year, the Class moved before the motion judge to have him “deliver” his
    judgment on the quantum of damages.  The Crown opposed the motion and moved
    to quash the proceedings for want of jurisdiction, arguing that the Supreme
    Court’s ruling had brought the matter to an end.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    motion that he deliver his judgment on damages: <i>Authorson v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</i> (2003), 69 O.R. (3d) 106 (S.C.J.) (“delivery decision”).  He
    ruled that the Class’s claim was always that the Crown failed to “invest
    or pay interest”, and that any reference in his earlier reasons to shorten
    the description of the claim to “interest” only was not determinative.  Rather,
    he explained, at para. 7, that references in the earlier judgments to “interest”
    rather than “damages” were a result of the “natural tendency to abbreviate”,
    and that since the action had been bifurcated, no serious thought had been
    given to the possible make-up of damages during the liability phase.  In
    the motion judge’s view, at para. 18, it was not until the damages motion
    in March 2003 that the court or the parties turned their minds to “the difference,
    if any, between interest and damages, and the interesting development in
    the courts of the ideas of a plaintiff having to make an election as to whether
    to claim damages or interest, and of using interest as a convenient substitute
    for damages”. </p>

    motion judge rejected the Crown’s submission that the Class’s <i>Bill of
    Rights </i>argument had been premised on the idea that s. 5.1(4) was an absolute
    bar to its claim for damages, on the theory that only a complete taking could
    amount to a deprivation of property sufficient to trigger the <i>Bill of
    Rights</i>.  The motion judge acknowledged that he had previously described
    s.&nbsp;5.1(4) as “on its face an absolute bar to this action” and had held
    that that the section, “which would appear to bar this action, cannot do
    so because it offends the <i>Bill of Rights</i>”.  However, the motion judge
    held that these earlier findings were not determinative, but were rather
    merely comments made in the context of the argument put before the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge further ruled that the portion of the liability decision declaring
    that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty by failing to invest or pay interest
    had not been disturbed by the Supreme Court of Canada, and that this declaration
    continued to provide a basis for assessing and awarding damages.  In so holding,
    the motion judge rejected the Crown’s submission that the claim was barred
    by <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i> or issue estoppel<i>,</i> or that he was <i>functus </i>following
    the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge also rejected the Crown’s submission that s. 5.1(4) had to be
    interpreted as a complete bar to the Class’s claim for damages.  Instead,
    he accepted the Class’s submission that s. 5.1(4) barred only a limited amount
    of interest, which would have to be deducted from the overall award of damages
    for failure to invest.   To reach this conclusion, the motion judge applied
    the common law presumption that a statute should not be given a construction
    that impairs existing rights unless the language in which it is couched compels
    that result.  He also applied the presumption that Parliament uses language
    consistently within a statute so that the same words must have the same meaning
    throughout.  He noted that s. 5.1(2)(b), introduced at the same time as s.
    5.1(4) but never proclaimed in force, provides that interest may be paid
    on DVA-administered accounts at the rate fixed by s. 21(2) of the <i>Financial
    Administration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;F-11(“<i>FA Act</i>”), namely,
    90% of the T-Bill rate.  The motion judge applied this definition of “interest” to
    s. 5.1(4).  This, he ruled, meant that s. 5.1(4) extinguished the claim for
    damages for breach of fiduciary duty, but only to the extent of the amount
    of interest as defined in s. 5.1(2)(b). </p>

    judgment.  He further ruled that neither federal nor provincial limitations
    statutes operated to bar the Class’s claims, and that any equitable limitations
    were not applicable by reason of equitable fraud.  The motion judge then
    made a number of orders relating to the quantum of damages, including:</p>

    December 2005, the motion judge issued a judgment confirming his authority
    to take judicial notice of “the general acceptance in the financial community

    within a portfolio”: <i>Authorson Estate v. Canada</i> <i>(Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>[2005]
    O.J. No. 5582 (S.C.J.) (“judicial notice decision”).  This was an important
    finding because without the ability to vary the portfolio from the norms,
    the resulting damage award would have been substantially lower.  </p>

  <h2>V.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Issue 1: Did the
    motion judge err by failing to find that the Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s liability judgment finally ended the litigation?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown has raised several issues in support of its contention that the Supreme
    Court’s 2003 judgment put an end to any and all claims that the Class had,
    or may have had, for damages resulting from the Crown’s failure to invest
    or pay interest on the funds it administered for the Class from 1915 until
    1990.  The various issues are identified in the Crown’s factum under the
    broad heading “Jurisdictional Errors”. They have been framed as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Error One: The
    Supreme Court of Canada’s decision ended the litigation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Error Two: Brockenshire
    J. was <i>functus officio</i> and without jurisdiction to amend a final judgment
    [the 2000 liability decision] that decided s. 5.1(4) barred all claims for
    damages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Error Three:
    The plaintiff’s cause merged in the judgment [the 2000 liability decision]
    and all claims for damages were <i>res judicata</i> (by virtue of issue estoppel
    and/or cause of action estoppel). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    propose to address these jurisdictional problems not on an issue-by-issue
    basis but more by way of an historical overview of the case, with particular
    emphasis on the metamorphosis of the Class position.  In the end, we agree
    with the Crown that the judgment of the Supreme Court was final and binding
    and that there was no basis for the Class to pursue its claim, in whole or
    in part, after that judgment had been rendered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regrettably,
    the motion judge viewed the matter differently.   Had he applied the correct
    principles of law to the irrefutable facts, he would, in our respectful view,
    have recognized the October 2003 Class motion for delivery of the judgment
    on its “outstanding quantum motion” as a blatant case of revisionism and
    dismissed it out of hand.  As it is, that motion has resulted in four years
    of unnecessary litigation and an unfortunate drain on scarce judicial resources.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his 2003 delivery decision, in which he allowed the Class to proceed on its “outstanding
    quantum motion”, the motion judge observed, at para. 2, that with the consent
    of the parties early on in the proceedings, he had “divided up” the many
    issues to be decided “under four headings: liability for failure to invest,
    liability for failure to pay out re deceased veterans, the assessment of
    damages for the failure to invest or pay interest, and the assessment of
    damages re the failure to pay out principal to the estates of deceased veterans”.  Of
    those, one and three are central to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    four-fold division of issues was not overlooked by the Supreme Court of Canada.  As
    a prelude to identifying the single issue of contention on the Crown’s appeal
    from this court’s decision upholding the motion judge’s 2000 liability decision,
    Major J. referred to the division of the proceedings at para. 25 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Brockenshire
    J., the trial judge, divided the litigation into two separate proceedings. <i>One
    action was for interest on funds administered by the DVA</i>. The other was
    for principal unpaid when veterans died while their funds were still being
    administered by the DVA. <i>Each action had both a liability and a damages
    phase. This appeal is limited to the first action assessing the liability
    of the Crown for interest on the funds.</i> [Emphasis added.]<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the language used by Major J. in defining the scope of the appeal
    admits of only one interpretation.  At issue was the liability of the Crown
    in the first action, which he comprehensively defined as “an action … for
    interest on funds administered by the DVA”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    defining the first action that way, we are satisfied that Major J. was referring
    to the action in its entirety and not just a portion of it.  Had he meant
    a portion of it, surely he would have said so.  But he did not because the
    case had been fought out, from start to finish, on an all or nothing basis.  Either
    s. 5.1(4) of the Act barred the first action in its entirety or it did not.  There
    were no half measures here.  Not once, during the lengthy and prolonged proceedings,
    from the motion to certify to the hearing before the Supreme Court, did the
    Class even suggest – let alone argue – that what was at issue was strictly
    the validity of s. 5.1(4), not its scope.  Nor did the Class raise that issue
    anywhere in the mass of material filed in the Superior Court, this court
    or the Supreme Court. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  That
    everyone, including the Supreme Court, approached s. 5.1(4) as an “all or
    nothing” proposition is evident from the history of the proceedings. The
    record is replete with indicators that bear this out.  They are far too many
    to list, let alone detail.  We have chosen to outline some of the more cogent
    examples.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  First,
    in their statement of claim, issued in 1999, the Class sought:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Damages for
    breach of fiduciary duty and/or breach of trust <i>equivalent to the difference
    between the accumulated principal amount of pension monies paid to the Department
    of Veterans Affairs for the benefit of the plaintiff and the amount which
    could have been realized if the plaintiff’s pension monies had been invested</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    wording used in the damage claim was, in our view, carefully selected.  It
    tracked the language used by the Auditor General, at para. 13.44 of his 1985
    report, which stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a trustee,
    the department has a responsibility to invest funds in approved instruments
    and to account to the beneficiary regularly. <i>The department is vulnerable
    to legal action by veterans to recover the difference between the amounts
    accumulated in the trust accounts and what would have been produced if the
    money had been properly invested.</i> Given the amounts involved and the
    length of time that many of these accounts have been in existence, this liability
    could be large. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    passage, along with others from the same report, is reproduced at para. 55
    of the motion judge’s 2000 liability decision. It exposes the problem that
    s. 5.1(4) was enacted to address. Certainly, the motion judge knew that to
    be the case.  At para. 98 of the 2000 liability decision, he held: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>That subsection
    [s. 5.1(4)] does not, on its face, have anything to do with improving the
    benefits, or the benefit system, of veterans – on its face, <i>its only objective
    is to block legitimate potential claims by veterans. The Crown was well aware
    of those potential claims, both from its own studies and from the blunt reports
    of the Auditor General.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, s. 5.1(4) was enacted to prevent precisely the kind of damage
    claim that the Class was bringing and that the Auditor General had foreseen.  And
    that is why everyone, throughout, including the Class, realized that if s.
    5.1(4) was operational, it acted as a complete bar to the Class claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as is apparent from the certification decision, the motion judge understood
    only too well the nature, scope and breadth of the Class damage claim and
    the impact of s. 5.1(4) on it.  At para. 5 of that ruling, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The remedies
    being sought are firstly damages for breach of trust and/or breach of fiduciary
    duty, secondly a constructive trust; thirdly restitution, and fourthly an
    accounting. <i>Notably what is being claimed is not interest per se, but
    damages. A further issue which was alleged to be common to all is whether
    s. 5.1(4) of the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, which purports to take
    away the right of action for such damages accruing before 1990, is constitutionally
    valid,</i> or in the alternative invalid and inoperative by reason of conflict
    with the <i>Bill of Rights</i> or the <i>Charter</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    in the certification order dated October 26, 1999, the effect of s. 5.1(4)
    on “the plaintiff’s claims” was certified as two of the eight common issues.  Paragraphs
    6(e) and (f) of that order reflect those issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(e) If s. 5.1(4)
    of the <i>Department of Veterans’ Affairs Act</i>, or s. 9 of the <i>Crown
    Liabilities and Proceedings Act</i>, retroactively bar or exempt the plaintiff’s
    claims are they invalid and inoperative by reason of a conflict with section
    1(a) or s. 2(e) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> or section 7 or 15
    of the <i>Charter</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(f)  If s. 5.1(4)
    of the <i>Department of Veterans’ Affairs Act</i>, or s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Crown
    Liabilities and Proceedings Act</i>, retroactively bar or exempt the plaintiff’s
    claims for damages and are invalid and inoperative by reason of a conflict
    with section 1(a) or s. 2(e) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> or section
    7 or 15 of the <i>Charter</i>, are same saved by s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    in its pleadings, the Crown consistently maintained that s. 5.1(4) acted
    as a complete bar to the claims asserted by the class.  Paragraph 14 of the
    Fresh as Amended Statement of Defence, dated July 14, 1999, is illustrative:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defendant
    states that claims by veterans of Canada’s armed forces for or on account
    of interest on monies held or administered by the Crown during any period
    prior to January 1, 1990, pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the <i>Pension
    Act</i>, subsection 15(2) of the <i>War Veterans Allowance Act</i> or any
    regulations made under section 5 of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs
    Act</i> have been barred by statute. The defendant pleads and relies upon
    subsection 5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i>, which
    came into force on October 12, 1990.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its reply pleadings, the Class consistently maintained that s. 5.1(4) was
    constitutionally infirm.  Hence, it was inoperative and could not be used
    to bar the claims being asserted.  At no time did the Class ever assert that,
    if valid, s. 5.1(4) operated only as a partial bar to its claim.  Paragraph
    5(d) of the “Fresh as Amended Reply” dated October&nbsp;22, 2001, is illustrative:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.         In
    response to paragraph 13 of the amended statement of defence and the defendant’s
    allegation that subsection 5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs
    Act </i>prohibits the Crown from paying interest to members of the armed
    forces on account of ‘monies held and administered by the Crown for their
    benefit’, the plaintiff says that that provision is unconstitutional, in
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(d)       in any event, the provision contravenes subsection 1(a) and
    2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights by constituting, in form and substance,
    a deprivation of property belonging, or owing to, the plaintiff without due
    process of law, <i>or in the alternative, the deprivation of the fundamental
    right to a fair hearing for the determination of his rights</i>. [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    the 2000 liability decision granting judgment to the Class was the culmination
    of two motions for summary judgment, one by the Class seeking judgment on
    its action, the other by the Crown seeking that the class action be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its motion, the Crown sought a determination before trial of various questions
    of law, including the following question identified at para. a (ix):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(ix) is the
    plaintiff’s action barred in whole <i>or in part</i> by reason of subsection
    5.1(4) of the <i>Department of Veterans’ Affairs Act</i>? [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    framing the matter that way, i.e. whether s. 5.1(4) might only be a “partial” bar
    to the “plaintiff’s action”, the Crown raised the very issue that the Class
    now claims has been its position throughout.  Surely, if that were so, the
    Class would have made this clear in the materials it filed in response to
    the Crown’s summary judgment motion.  And yet, in the 800-page factum filed
    on behalf of the Class on the original summary judgment proceedings, not
    one word to that effect can be found. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the contrary, numerous passages in that document show that the Class viewed
    the entire action as one for damages for
    “lost interest” due to the Crown’s failure to “pay interest” or “to invest
    or otherwise accrue interest” on the trust funds it was administering.  It
    also viewed s. 5.1(4) as a complete bar to its “damages” claim. For example,
    in para. 1, we see the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As administrator
    of these funds, the Crown through the DVA or CPC [Canadian Pension Commission]
    had a fiduciary or trust duty towards the disabled veterans to act in the
    best interests of that veteran and to avoid any conflict of interest. <i>These
    fiduciary or trust duties included the duty to prudently invest the funds
    to realize a reasonable rate of return on the veterans’ administered funds.
    The Crown has failed to properly invest those funds or to pay interest in
    lieu of investment. Documents show that for many years, the DVA and CPC have
    or ought to have known that it was liable to compensate these disabled veterans
    for their failure to invest or pay interest.</i>  They knew that, by their
    failure to do this in a timely manner, that they had created a huge liability
    in respect of interest owing.  <i>In order to eliminate the liability for
    the DVA on CPC’s inaction, the Government of Canada procured an act of Parliament
    enacting section 5.1(4) of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Act, which
    purports to confiscate the disabled veteran’s right to recover interest owing
    to them prior to 1990.</i>  This enactment contravenes the <i>Canadian Bill
    of Rights</i> and should be declared inoperative. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>And at para. 80:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Calculations
    have been prepared to quantify the global damages for failure to invest
    or otherwise accrue interest on the aforesaid trust funds.</i> [Emphasis

  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;page-break-after:

    exposure to liability it created by its failure to <i>invest or pay interest
    on administered trust accounts</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>And finally at paras. 272 to 274:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>The clear
    wording of this section clearly purports to take away any right of action,
    in respect of any claim of interest, for any period prior to January 1,
    1990.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>This section
    was proclaimed in force in 1990, and purports, by its clear wording, to
    bar any retroactive claim for interest, such as the claims being advanced
    by the plaintiff in the present case.</i>  The plaintiff, however, submits
    that this section is inoperative by reason of conflict with the <i>Bill
    of Rights</i> and the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>It is respectfully
    submitted that, on the overwhelming preponderance of evidence, a review
    of all of the background factual matters discussed above, dictates that
    the Crown, at all times, knew it had a serious liability for unpaid interest,</i> but
    made a conscious decision in the 1970s, again in the early 1980s, and finally
    in 1990, that it would not pay interest on administered funds.  In 1990,
    the Crown decided to change its policy with a simple procedure of having
    the Minister of Finance agree to pay interest on administered accounts,
    but only from January 1, 1990.  Commensurate with the change in policy,
    the <i>Department of Veterans Affairs Act</i> was amended to prohibit claims
    for past interest.  <i>It is clear that section 5.1(4) of the Department
    of Veterans Act was intended to prevent severely, profoundly disabled veterans,
    otherwise unable to manage their own affairs, from recovering interest
    as damages arising out of the Crown’s failure to properly invest those
    funds or provide a reasonable rate of return thereon.</i>  It is respectfully
    submitted that the passage of section 5.1(4) was a naked attempt to confiscate
    a property right, otherwise accruing to the severely disabled veterans.
    It is therefore respectfully submitted that this provision constitutes,
    in form and substance, a confiscation of property belonging to, or owing
    to, the plaintiff without due process, and thus contravene section 1(a)
    of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    passages show that in referring to the word “interest”, the Class was using
    it to encompass its entire claim for damages.  They also reaffirm that the
    Class fully understood the scope of s. 5.1(4), and knew that it had been
    enacted to eliminate precisely the kind of damage claim that it was asserting.  As
    such, they expose its present position, adopted only after the Supreme Court’s

    in this court, on appeal by the Crown from the 2000 liability decision, Austin
    and Goudge JJ.A. defined the pivotal issue at para. 11 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue in
    these proceedings is whether the federal government is liable to the respondent <i>for
    its failure to invest or pay interest</i> on the respondent’s money in the
    government’s hands for administration. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    their conclusion at para. 81 that the motion judge was correct in declaring
    that the Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the Class and that it breached that
    duty “by failing to invest or pay interest on the funds under its administration”,
    Austin and Goudge&nbsp;JJ.A. continued at para. 98:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 5.1(4)
    purports to prohibit the bringing of <i>this action</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    analyzing s. 5.1(4) and determining that the motion judge was correct in
    concluding that it was inoperative because it contravened the <i>Bill of
    Rights</i>, Austin and Goudge JJ.A. summarized their findings and conclusions
    at para. 133 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For these reasons,
    we agree with the conclusions and dispositions that the motions judge made
    on each of the issues in appeal. In particular, we agree that the Crown was
    a fiduciary to the class members while their funds were being administered
    by the DVA <i>and that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty by failing to
    invest or pay interest on these funds. In addition, s. 9 of the CLPA is not
    a bar to this action. Nor is section 5.4(1) of the Department of Veterans
    Affairs Act a bar </i>[to this action] because it is rendered inoperative
    as against these claims by the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the implication stemming from this court’s reasoning could not
    be clearer.  If s.&nbsp;5.1(4) were operative, it would be a bar to the action – not
    just a portion of it, but the entire action.  That message could not have
    been lost on the Class.  It knew, or should have known, that its entire action
    hinged on the inoperability of s.&nbsp;5.1(4).  That is how the Crown presented
    its case to the Supreme Court, and that is how the Class responded.  Indeed,
    in oral argument before the Supreme Court, Class counsel described s. 5.1(4)
    as “an absolute bar”.  Only after the adverse ruling from the Supreme Court
    did the Class change its stance and adopt the revisionist position it is
    now asserting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eighth,
    cogent evidence that exposes the present position of the Class as “revisionist” is
    found in its “Factum on Quantum”
    filed with the motion judge in February 2001, more than two years before
    the decision of the Supreme Court.  In it, the Class seeks aggregate damages “in
    the amount of $1,617,403,686” or in the alternative, “that a reference be
    directed … to take accounts”.  The aggregate figure is described as a “lump
    sum as interest” owing to the Class.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout
    the document, the damage claim is referred to as monies owing for “interest” and
    specifically, the amount of accrued interest that would have been earned
    had the funds been invested in a mixed investment portfolio. At para. 16,
    the Class compares the differential in the amount of interest that would
    have been earned depending on the investment vehicle chosen. The pertinent
    part reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… For example,
    if the entire amount of the trust funds had been invested in Government of
    Canada long term bonds, with interest compounded annually, for the entire
    period then, reading from Table 1, the accrued earnings of the funds would
    be $810,177,342.  Alternatively, if the entire amount of the trust funds
    had been invested in TSE composite equities for the entire period then, reading
    from Table 1, the accrued earnings of the funds would be $3,282,781,050.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 17 of the Class factum, a chart is produced setting out the “accrued
    interest calculation” that could “be used to estimate the accrued earnings
    associated with a wide range of trust portfolios”.  Based on a “middle of
    the road” rate of return, the accrued earnings, as of December 31, 2000, “would
    be $1,617,403,686”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras. 63 to 65 and 73 to 77, the factum sets outs the rates and kinds of
    interest that are available, in law, when a fiduciary has either misappropriated
    funds or failed to invest them.  Paragraphs 73 and 75 are particularly instructive.
    The pertinent passages are set out below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are various
    justifications for an <i>award of compound interest</i>: the beneficiary
    is deprived of money which it needs. The person who misappropriates the money
    has made a profit on it, and should give up that profit. The assumption is
    that if the claimant beneficiary had not been deprived of the money, then
    the claimant would have invested it advantageously. A person who has misappropriated
    properties is considered as having committed a species of fraud and will
    not be allowed to profit in any way either directly or indirectly from his
    action. <i>Interest from the profits realized</i> is imposed in equity in
    order to prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant who retains and thus
    is deemed to benefit from the profits gained from his misappropriation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Compound
    interest</i> is awarded by courts of equity as damages by reason of a wrongful
    detention of money which ought to have been paid. <i>In equity interest
    is awarded</i> whenever a wrongdoer deprives a beneficiary of money which
    it needs for its own use and benefit. Mere replacement of the money – years
    later – is by no means adequate compensation, especially in days of inflation. <i>The
    beneficiary should be compensated by the award of interest.  On general
    principles it should be presumed that the beneficiary (had it not been
    deprived of the money) would have made the most beneficial use open to
    it.  Alternatively, it should be presumed that the wrongdoer made the most
    beneficial use of it. In order to give adequate compensation, the money
    should be replaced at interest with yearly rests. (i.e. compound interest).</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And at para.
    87, we find the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>If the Public Accounts constitute the principal amount in the trust funds,
    on an aggregate basis from year to year, it then becomes possible, through
    straightforward mathematical calculation, to <i>determine the aggregate amount
    of damages for interest owed to the class.</i> It is therefore respectfully
    submitted that the aggregate class damages therefore approximate $1,617,403,686
    as calculated by Dr. Charette, the Plaintiff’s Economist. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    critical conclusions can be drawn from that factum.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the damage claim was framed in terms of
    “loss of interest” and the quantum was to be calculated by figuring out the
    amount of interest that would have accrued, on a compound basis, had the
    Crown invested the funds it was administering in a mixed investment portfolio.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the factum contains no hint that the damage award would be reduced if s.&nbsp;5.1(4)
    were found to be valid.  The reason for that, in our view, is clear. The
    entire claim was premised on the assumption that s. 5.1(4) would be declared
    inoperable.  When it was not, the Class went back to the drawing board and
    came up with a new theory which it attempted to disguise as a damages issue.  The
    motion judge unfortunately gave effect to it.  He should not have.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Our
    conclusion that the Class adopted a new theory of the case only after the
    Supreme Court had ruled on the validity of s. 5.1(4) is further strengthened
    by a review of the transcript of oral argument before the Supreme Court in
    2003.   That record indicates that when Binnie J. asked counsel for the Class
    whether he wished to keep the motion judge’s first four declarations in place
    (for our purposes, that the Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the Class and
    that it breached its duty by failing to pay interest or invest the funds
    it was administering), even if the Crown were to succeed on the fifth (that
    s. 5.1(4) was operative), counsel for the Class stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Colautti:
    Yes. And they – they’re not directly under appeal here and they – they should
    remain in place, and it – if – <i>if the Crown succeeds on section – on the
    on the fifth section, then of course, these veterans get nothing</i>. And – and,
    in order to succeed, though, they have to pass the hurdle of both s. 1(a)
    and s. 2(e), and the fast [<i>sic</i>] that section –</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Binnie J.: That
    all relates to the fifth declaration –</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Colautti:
    Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Binnie J.: – at
    the time. Because you’re dwelling on the merits of the fiduciary, and so
    on, I am just curious as to whether –</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Colautti:
    Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Binnie J.: – <i>you’re
    asking that the first four declarations be maintained even if the fifth</i> –</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Colautti:
    Yes. <i>The reason why I’m dwelling on the –
    on the fiduciary duties is that it is vital to the argument on due process</i>,
    and it is vital because the Crown freely entered into this fiduciary duty
    to protect these veterans, but then, when it became inconvenient because
    there had been a mismanagement of their property, they sought to bar the
    claims. And the essence of this case is whether that kind of action passes
    muster under the <i>Bill of Rights</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s
    response is instructive for two reasons. First, it is an unqualified admission
    on behalf of the Class that if the <i>Bill of Rights</i> argument were to
    fail and s.&nbsp;5.1(4) were to be found operational, then “these veterans
    get nothing”.  Second, his reason for wanting to keep the first four declarations
    in place, particularly the one declaring that the Crown owed a fiduciary
    duty to the Class, is illuminating. Far from advising the court that it was
    important to keep that declaration in place so that the Class could proceed
    with its “outstanding quantum” motion, Mr.&nbsp;Colautti responded that the “fiduciary
    declaration” was “vital to the argument on due process” and that “the essence” of
    the case was whether, having failed in its duty to protect the veterans,
    it was constitutionally permissible for the Crown to pass legislation designed “to
    bar the claims”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his 2003 delivery decision allowing the Class to proceed in respect of the “outstanding
    quantum” motion, the motion judge considered Mr. Colautti’s remark – “then
    of course these veterans get nothing”
    – and rejected the Crown’s submission that it should be treated “as a considered
    admission against interest of the class members”. Instead, he characterized
    it (at para. 26) as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… <i>an off-hand
    statement by counsel</i>, who had just completed oral argument on the constitutional
    question as to the applicability of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>, during which,
    incidentally, as both counsel had done throughout this litigation, he referred
    to the claim of the class members as one for interest. <i>The issue of
    the interpretation of s. 5.1(4) and its effect on the damage claim of the
    class members had not been researched and argued, and no considered position
    on that issue had ever been put forth by class counsel</i>. The interests
    of justice would not be served if a <i>chance remark</i> such as this could
    be taken to forever bar the rights of the class members to have the issue
    fully heard and adjudicated by the courts. I do not accept that an <i>unfortunate
    remark</i> by counsel can remove the jurisdiction of this court. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, we do not know how or on what basis the motion judge came to characterize
    counsel’s remark as “off-hand”,
    “chance” and “unfortunate”.  Before us, the same counsel has submitted something
    very different.  At para. 69 of the Class factum, he states that his remark:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…
    that the Class members ‘would  receive nothing’ is taken entirely out of
    context. The discussion before the court was about ‘interest’ in s. 5.1(4).
    At no time was any concession made that the Class plaintiffs would be entirely
    without remedy, whether for damages, disgorgement or other equitable remedy
    arising from the Crown’s admitted breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taken
    at face value, counsel is now saying that his so-called “chance” remark to
    the Supreme Court was both calculated and considered.  It was meant to relate
    only to “interest”, presumably because he had considered the scope of s.
    5.1(4) and felt that it only addressed “interest” and not any other head
    of damages that the Class could pursue by virtue of the Crown’s breach of
    its fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    that is so, it calls into question, as well, the motion judge’s second reason
    for not taking counsel’s remark at face value, namely, that “the issue of
    the interpretation of s.&nbsp;5.1(4) and its effect on the damages claim
    of the Class members had not been researched”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    we do not know how or from whom the motion judge obtained that information.
    But, as indicated, it cannot be correct if, as counsel now submits, his remarks
    were considered and calculated and meant only to address the validity of
    s.&nbsp;5.1(4), not its scope.  Accepting that to be the case, it is obvious
    that counsel must, at the very least, have considered the scope of s. 5.1(4)
    and its effect on the damage claim, even if he had not argued it to that
    point.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    that is so, we are left to wonder why counsel did not explain to the Supreme
    Court that his reason for wanting to preserve the “fiduciary finding” was
    so that he could continue the damage claim on behalf of the Class, even if
    the claim for interest was found to be barred by s. 5.1(4).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the truth lies in all of this is difficult to discern.  On balance, our review
    of the record leads us to conclude that counsel’s remark – “then these veterans
    will get nothing” – reflects the view he held at the time and that it encompassed
    not just the claim for interest but the claim for damages as a whole.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    be sure, in the context of the <i>Bill of Rights</i> argument, it served
    counsel’s purpose to have the Supreme Court consider s. 5.1(4) on an “all
    or nothing” basis.  The more “pernicious” it appeared to be, the better the
    chance of having it declared inoperative under the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.  Looked
    at differently, if s. 5.1(4) related only to interest and not damages as
    a whole, it could hardly be described as
    “pernicious”, especially when, as here, on the motion judge’s analysis, the
    interest component proved to be but a pittance of the damages owing to the
    Class by reason of the Crown’s failure to invest and accrue interest on their
    funds. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Just
    as counsel believed that s. 5.1(4) was an
    “all or nothing” provision, so too, in our view, did the motion judge, at
    least until the Supreme Court declared s. 5.1(4) to be valid.  Were it otherwise,
    surely he would have had no reason to describe s. 5.1(4) as a “pernicious
    subsection”. And yet, as discussed above, that is precisely how he characterized
    it in the 2000 liability decision when he concluded that s. 5.1(4) violated
    the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.  His remarks in that regard, found at para. 98,
    along with his concluding remarks at para. 101, provide a window into the
    motion judge’s understanding of the purpose and scope of the impugned provision.  As
    such, they bear repetition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Relating those
    principles to this case, I conclude that the <i>Bill of Rights</i> provides
    an effective remedy in this case. The general right to property is specifically
    recognized in s.&nbsp;1(a) of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.  The right to require
    a trustee or fiduciary to invest funds on hand, and/or pay interest, has
    existed since the 1700s. The omnibus Bill was certainly passed in pursuit
    of a valid federal legislative objective, but the Bill as a whole is not
    impugned – just s. 5.1(4).  <i>That subsection does not, on its face, have
    anything to do with improving the benefits, or the benefit system, of veterans – on
    its face, its only objective is to block legitimate potential claims by veterans.
    The Crown was well aware of those potential claims, both from its own studies
    and from the blunt reports of the Auditor General.  No evidence at all of
    any higher purpose for this pernicious subsection</i>, buried in the Bill,
    that could come even close to objectives of general good for veterans, or
    for the country, as a whole, has been put before this court, nor has any
    indication been given that s.&nbsp;5.1(4) was necessary for, or even related
    to, the objectives of the Bill. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I declare that
    s. 5.1(4) of the Department of Veterans Affairs Act is inoperative in <i>barring
    the claims</i> raised by the plaintiff class in this action. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>            In
    our respectful view, these passages make it abundantly clear that the motion
    judge viewed s. 5.1(4) as a complete bar to the “claims raised by the plaintiff
    class in this action”.  To repeat, that is why he called the provision “pernicious”.  Had
    he believed otherwise (i.e., that the Class could nonetheless pursue its
    damage claim and ultimately receive an award of $4.6 billion), surely he
    would have found a more charitable adjective to describe it.  Of equal significance
    is his reference to s. 5.1(4)’s objective being “to block legitimate potential
    claims” that “the Crown was well aware of … from the blunt reports of the
    Auditor General”.  As we saw at paras. 54 and 55, <i>supra</i>, the claim
    as pleaded by the Class was precisely the kind of damage claim that the Auditor
    General had foreseen, and that s. 5.1(4) was enacted to “block”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  More
    to the point, it is apparent to us that the Supreme Court also viewed s.
    5.1(4) as an “all or nothing” provision. Otherwise, we see no reason why
    this country’s highest court would have granted leave to appeal on what,
    in the end, according to the Class and the motion judge, turned out to be
    nothing more than an interlocutory ruling on one aspect (and a minor one
    at that) of the overall damage claim.  In any event, even if the Supreme
    Court was somehow alive to the fact that the constitutionality of s. 5.1(4)
    was just a small piece of the puzzle, it is inconceivable that the court
    would have evaluated its constitutionality without first ascertaining its
    purpose, meaning and scope.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    Class relies on a different exchange between the Supreme Court and counsel
    during the 2003 liability hearing in support of its position that the Supreme
    Court was aware it was only dealing with a portion of the Class’s overall
    claim.  In oral argument before the Supreme Court, Crown counsel advised
    that he could not ask the court to dismiss the case in its entirety “in view
    of the subsequent expansion of the claim.”  He therefore asked the court
    to dismiss the claim “for interest.”  </p>

    us, the Crown explained that the “expansion” to which counsel referred was
    a result of the motion judge’s ruling that the Crown was liable not just
    to living veterans, but also to deceased veterans who died after 1986.  As
    we explained above, this “phase two”
    decision was handed down just days before the Supreme Court hearing on the
    first phase of the action.  The Crown could no longer ask the Supreme Court
    to dismiss the <i>entire</i> action, since the litigation now encompassed
    the motion judge’s most recent ruling, and that ruling had to first be appealed
    to this court.  That appeal has now been heard and the remaining claim has
    been dismissed.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that Crown counsel’s answer
    before the Supreme Court has any bearing on the situation as it now stands.</p>

    intended to bar any and all claims against the Crown for breach of its fiduciary
    duty to invest or pay interest on DVA-administered funds.  We therefore agree

    is no dispute as to the context and the mischief that s. 5.1(4) was designed
    to address.  As discussed above, in the late 1980s, following the <i>Guerin</i> decision
    and the Auditor General’s report warning that the DVA was vulnerable to legal
    action, Parliament was confronted with the problem of what to do about a
    potentially large claim against the Crown for the failure to invest or pay
    interest on DVA-administered funds.  Parliament enacted a package of amendments
    to the <i>DVA Act</i> intended to solve that problem by providing for the
    payment of interest prospectively from 1990, and barring any payment of interest
    or claim “for or on account of interest” that accrued prior to 1990. </p>

    Class submits that s. 5.1(4) deals only with claims for interest and that
    the claim for failure to invest is not barred.  We disagree.  In our view,
    Parliament’s silence as to liability for failure to invest the funds does
    not undermine or limit the legal scope of s.&nbsp;5.1(4) as a complete bar
    on all claims for failure to invest or pay interest pre-1990.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    intention of Parliament in enacting s. 5.1(4) and using the words “claim…for
    or on account of interest” must be interpreted in light of the general legislative
    framework that governed the Crown and the DVA in relation to the administration
    of the funds of disabled veterans.  There are clear legislative limitations
    imposed on the Crown in the administration of the Consolidated Revenue Fund,
    where the DVA-administered funds were required by law to be held.  As we
    explain below, the governing legislative framework prevented the Crown from
    investing in external markets or from paying anything but interest as an
    investment return.  The Crown, even when acting as a fiduciary, cannot act
    contrary to the law.  Interest was the only form of investment return for
    which the government could in law have been liable during the relevant time
    period. When Parliament barred all claims “for or on account of interest” in
    s. 5.1(4), it intended to eliminate the only liability that could be imposed:
    to invest in interest-bearing assets such as savings bonds, and to pay interest
    on the veterans’ accounts. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    DVA-administered funds were properly held by the Crown in the Consolidated
    Revenue Fund.  Section 102 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> provides
    that public money “shall form One Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated
    for the Public Service of Canada” and s. 2 of the <i>FA Act</i> defines the
    Consolidated Revenue Fund as “the aggregate of all public moneys that are
    on deposit at the credit of the Receiver General”.  Section 15 of the <i>FA
    Act </i>provides that the Minister of Finance is given the “supervision,
    control and direction of all matters relating to the financial affairs of
    Canada”, including the “management of the Consolidated Revenue Fund”. </p>

    squarely within the definition of “public money”. The DVA-administered funds
    were “money that is paid to or received or collected by a public officer

    money.  As the DVA-administered funds could only be invested in certain interest-bearing

    this regard, the motion judge correctly interpreted s. 5.1(4) in the 2000
    liability decision when he found, at para. 43 that s. 5.1(4) “is on its face
    an absolute bar to this action.”  Regrettably, when faced with the adverse
    decision from the Supreme Court of Canada on the validity of s. 5.1(4), the
    motion judge adopted a different interpretation. No doubt motivated by a
    desire to right what he perceived to be a wrong to the disabled veterans,
    the motion judge’s re-interpretation of s. 5.1(4) appears to us to be an
    untenable attempt to overcome the statutory hurdle that the Supreme Court
    had held was a valid bar to the veterans’ claims. </p>

    reject the argument that s. 5.1(4) should be interpreted on the assumption
    that the DVA was obliged to manage the veterans’ money without regard to
    the statutory framework governing public funds or, as the motion judge put
    it, that the Crown somehow failed “to grasp” the nature of its fiduciary
    duty.  The issue of liability for failure to invest or pay interest in relation
    to the DVA-administered funds was placed squarely before Parliament, and
    the proposition that legislation should be interpreted on the basis that
    Parliament was ignorant of the law cannot be accepted. </p>

    Crown could not escape the legal framework imposed upon it as a public entity
    simply because it had undertaken a private law duty to the veterans.  Fiduciary
    duties, absent some constitutional underpinning, do not trump legislation
    that expressly dictates the scope of the Crown’s duties in relation to public
    funds.  The Crown’s fiduciary duty required the DVA to manage the veterans’ funds
    as a reasonably prudent trustee, and a prudent trustee cannot ignore the
    law governing the investment of trust funds.  In the case of the Crown, the <i>FA
    Act</i> prevented it from investing money held in the Consolidated Revenue
    Fund in external markets, and from paying anything but interest as an investment
    return.  </p>

    suggestion in the motion judge’s delivery decision that liability could be
    imposed for failure to enact legislation that fully met the Crown’s fiduciary
    obligation is, with respect, unsupported by authority and entirely without
    merit. There is no constitutional impediment to preclude the application
    of the limitations imposed by the <i>FA Act</i> on the investment of public
    money, and a private law fiduciary duty does not trigger a duty to enact
    legislation.  Similarly, the motion judge’s assertion in the delivery decision,
    at para. 35, that “having undertaken a fiduciary obligation, [the bureaucracy]
    should change the rules relating to the Government banking system, or if
    that was impossible, bank elsewhere” is fundamentally flawed.  The DVA did
    not have a “choice” of banking systems but was required by law to put the
    veterans’ funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to comply with the <i>FA
    Act</i>.</p>

    motion judge reasoned that as there was no definition of “interest” for the
    purposes of s. 5.1(4), it was appropriate to adopt the definition of interest
    used in s. 5.1(2)(b).  As explained above, that subsection, which was never
    proclaimed in force, provides for the payment of interest fixed by s. 21
    of the <i>FA Act</i>, namely 90% of the T-Bill rate.  This rate of interest
    amounts to approximately ten percent of the damages assessed by the motion
    judge. </p>

    we do not accept this interpretation.  We disagree with the motion judge’s
    view, expressed at para. 39, that “there is a symmetry and logic to treating
    the interest referred to in s. 5.1(4) as the same as the interest referred
    to, and specifically defined, in s. 5.1(2)(b).”  We see no logic whatsoever
    in paying a very low defined rate of interest post-1990 but leaving the pre-1990
    claim at large, limited only by the rate of interest to be paid in the future.  Why
    would Parliament provide for the payment of a very modest rate of interest
    post-1990, but allow veterans to claim massive damages for the pre-1990 period?  If
    Parliament intended to leave itself exposed to the pre-1990 claim, why would
    it limit the pre-1990 claim by the modest rate it was prepared to have the
    Crown pay post-1990?  We agree with the Crown’s submission that the Class
    has provided no credible explanation as to why Parliament would intend to
    prohibit the payment of $450 million of public money as interest, but willingly
    permit the payment of damages in a sum that is ten times larger.  The interpretation,
    in our view, is so completely implausible that it must be rejected.</p>

    that by enacting s. 5.1(4) of the <i>DVA Act</i>, Parliament intended to
    eliminate the Crown’s liability for failure to invest or pay interest on
    the veterans’ accounts before 1990 and that the effect of s. 5.1(4), now

    limitation period prescribed by statute in the province where the individual
    resided and the cause of action arose.  At worst – as the motion judge found
    to be the case – the Crown argued that the six-year limitation period provided
    for in s. 32 of the <i>CLPA </i>applied.  It submitted that the cause of
    action underlying the class proceeding was discoverable at least by 1985
    with the release of the Auditor General’s report, and, at the latest, by
    1990 with the passage of the <i>DVA Act </i>and specifically s. 5.1(4).   </p>

    principle of “equitable fraud” is aimed at preventing a limitation period
    from operating “as an instrument of injustice”: <i>M. (K.) v. M. (H.)</i>,
    [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 at para. 66. It has been described in many ways. Essentially,
    it involves some form of unconscionable conduct on the part of a wrongdoer
    who stands in a special relationship with another party, where the conduct
    conceals the existence of a claim by that party against the wrongdoer and
    is considered by equity to be sufficient to preclude the wrongdoer from relying
    on a limitation period defence.  See <i>Guerin, supra</i> at 390; <i>Kitchen

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is well established
    that where there has been a fraudulent concealment of the existence of a
    cause of action, the limitation period will not start to run until the plaintiff
    discovers the fraud, or until the time when, with reasonable diligence, he
    ought to have discovered it.  The fraudulent concealment necessary to toll
    or suspend the operation of the Statute need not amount to deceit or common
    law fraud.  Equitable fraud, defined in <i>Kitchen v. Royal Air Force Association</i>,
    [1958] 1 W.L.R. 563 [at p. 573], as, ‘conduct which, having regard to some
    special relationship between the two parties concerned, is an unconscionable

    not only the duty to invest, but generally the duty to act with the [utmost]
    good faith on behalf of the veterans, the duty to avoid any conflict with

    equitable fraud was not pleaded, in spite of several amendments to the pleadings.  Consequently,
    although the issue was argued, the Crown was deprived of the opportunity
    to challenge the allegations of equitable fraud or fraudulent concealment “in
    the evidence [on the motion]”: see <i>Kalkinis (Litigation Guardian of) v.
    Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.) at 534.  Parties

    the motion judge erred in law in relying upon the evidence which he noted
    that Austin J.A. had “gleaned” from the mass of materials before this court
    at the time of its 2002 liability decision in this action.  Many of those
    facts – outlined in subparagraphs (e) through (i) cited in para. 123 above – were
    taken from sources that were admitted into evidence as “legislative facts” or
    “constitutional evidence” in relation to the argument respecting the validity
    of s. 5.1(4) of the <i>DVA</i> <i>Act</i>.  They were not admitted as evidence
    for “adjudicative” purposes, and yet they were used by the motion judge to
    underpin a finding of unconscionable conduct on the part of unnamed servants
    of the Crown.  </p>

    Supreme Court of Canada has commented, however, that “courts should nevertheless
    proceed cautiously to take judicial notice even as ‘legislative facts’ of
    matters that are reasonably open to dispute, <i>particularly where they relate
    to an issue that could be dispositive</i>”
    [emphasis added]: <i>R v. Malmo-Levine</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571 at para.&nbsp;28.  In

    “legislative facts” and “social facts” in <i> R v. Spence</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R.
    458, Binnie J. emphasized at paras. 60-61 that the closer the facts in question
    approach the “dispositive issue” or “the centre of controversy between the
    parties (whether social, legislative or adjudicative) as distinguished from
    background facts at or near the periphery”, the more stringent the proof
    that may be called for.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the motion judge resorted to evidence that had been filed for the purpose
    of providing background with respect to the issue of the validity of s. 5.1(4),
    and used it to make findings on a central issue where the <i>lis</i> was
    directly between the Class and the Crown.  He should not have done so.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    there was no conduct on the part of the Crown that could be said to amount
    to
    “concealment” of the veterans’ rights to assert their fiduciary claim for
    failure to pay interest on or invest the funds under administration.  Parliament
    has been open in dealing with veterans’ pensions and benefits since 1916.  Departmental
    reports are recorded each year in the Public Accounts and are tabled in Parliament.  The
    fact that the Crown did not generally pay interest on the veterans’ funds,
    but did so in some cases, was a matter of public record.  Certainly, by 1985 – when
    the Report of the Auditor General specifically raised the issue of non-payment
    of interest and the Crown’s potential liability in that regard – the facts
    necessary to underpin the claims of the class members were openly in the
    public domain.  The Crown did nothing to hide these Reports or their implications.  At
    the very latest, the enactment of legislation in 1990 providing for the payment
    of interest on such funds from that point on, and including the s. 5.1(4)
    amendment barring claims for prior interest, was sufficient public notice
    of the basis for the claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Class relies – as did the motion judge – on certain policy discussions that
    took place at senior levels of government, following release of the <i>Guerin</i> decision,
    regarding the various options open to the Crown for addressing its potential
    liability as evidence of fraudulent concealment.  These discussions were
    not made public.  They included the consideration of options such as not
    saying anything about the problem and eliminating the old liability.  The
    Class also relies on the fact that the Minister of Justice made no specific
    reference to s. 5.1(4) – barring claims for or on account of retroactive
    interest – when he introduced the amending legislation providing for the
    payment of future interest in Parliament in 1990.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view none of this amounts to concealment of the sort that would give
    rise to the operation of the equitable fraud exception in the circumstances.  Public
    policy can only be set effectively if government officials are free to consider
    all lawful options in the course of wide-ranging and unrestricted discussion.  Courts
    should not infer impropriety on the part of government simply from the ebb
    and flow of legitimate policy discussions amongst public servants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the motion judge erred in imposing a reverse onus on the Crown, particularly
    where, as here, equitable fraud had not been pleaded and the Crown had no
    opportunity to meet the claim at the evidentiary level.  In concluding there
    is a reverse onus on discoverability where a fiduciary relationship exists,
    he relied upon the following passage from Michael Franks, <i>Limitation of
    Actions</i> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1959) at 237, cited by Southey
    J. in <i>Public Trustee v. Mortimer </i>(1985), 49 O.R. (2d) 741 (H.C.J.)
    at 755:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This principle
    that ignorance negatives laches underlies the rules governing fraud and mistake.  Thus
    where the plaintiff’s claim to relief rests upon the defendant’s fraud or
    where, being non-fraudulent, its existence has been fraudulently concealed
    from the plaintiff by the defendant, lapse of time cannot prejudice the plaintiff
    until he discovers the true situation or could, with the exercise of reasonable
    diligence, have discovered it.  <i>Where the parties stand in a fiduciary
    relationship to each other, it is insufficient for the defendant to show
    simply that the plaintiff had the means of discovering the fraud: he must
    prove that the plaintiff’s suspicions were aroused and that he determined
    not to investigate</i>.  This general rule that time does not count against
    the plaintiff until the fraud is or could be discovered applies, not only
    where the doctrine of laches is alone applicable, but also where the Statute
    is applied by analogy; and <i>semble</i> where it applies directly as well.
    [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on this passage, the motion judge concluded at para. 32 of the 2003 damages
    decision that “instead of … all the class members having to show that they
    exercised reasonable diligence, in inquiring why the were not receiving interest … the
    obligation would be on the Crown to prove that the suspicions of each class
    member [were] aroused and that he or she determined not to investigate”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    general, those who assert a proposition have the burden of establishing it
    and, in the context of the discoverability principle, the plaintiff bears
    the burden of demonstrating that the cause of action was not discoverable: <i>Mikisew
    Cree First Nation v. Canada</i>, [2002] A.J. No. 596 (C.A.) at para. 83.  We
    are not aware of any authority for the proposition that the onus is reversed
    where the discoverability issue arises within the framework of a fiduciary
    relationship.  To say that the standard of diligence required of a “defrauded” person
    may be attenuated in situations where that person is entitled to rely upon
    the other party – as Southey J. did in <i>Public Trustee v. Mortimer</i> – is
    not the same thing.  While it may make sense to be attuned to the level of
    proof that a plaintiff needs to put forward, depending on the circumstances,
    to meet the burden of discoverability, reversing the onus of proof is not
    justified.  On an issue like discoverability (what did the plaintiff know
    about the claim, and when, and what steps did the plaintiff take to pursue
    it) it would be at best difficult for the party who is the target of the
    reverse onus to establish these factors, and at worst unlikely that the party
    could do so.  The fact that a fiduciary has an obligation to keep the beneficiary
    of the relationship informed does not bear on this issue.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a class proceeding, such as this one, the burden imposed on the Crown “to
    prove that the suspicions of each class member [were] aroused and that he
    or she determined not to investigate” is an impossible one.  Here, it would
    be particularly unfair to saddle the Crown with a reverse onus when equitable
    fraud was not pleaded and the Crown therefore had no opportunity to lead
    any evidence on the issue.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Class argues that the Crown’s persistent denial of its fiduciary obligations
    to the veterans over the years, together with its failure to inform the veterans
    of their right to sue, constitutes equitable fraud.  We do not agree.  <i>Concealment </i>not <i>denial</i> is
    the gravamen of equitable fraud, and breach of the fiduciary obligation itself
    is not sufficient to trigger its application.</p>

    held that from 1916 forward the Crown should have invested the funds in a
    mixed portfolio of 60% bonds, 35% equity, and 5% cash.  In addition, in order
    to provide for flexibility in responding to changing market conditions, and
    in order to maximize the annual returns, he directed that variations be permitted
    in moving assets between categories, namely, 10% either way in both the bond
    and the equity portfolios and an upward variation of 15% in the cash portfolio.  In
    other words, the percentage of bonds in the mixed portfolio could vary from

    J. (as she then was) summarized the concept of judicial notice in this fashion
    in <i>R v. Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128 at para. 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>The law of
    evidence recognizes two ways in which facts can be established in the trial
    process. The first is by evidence.  The second is by judicial notice. … Judicial
    notice is the acceptance of a fact without proof.  It applies to two kinds
    of facts: (1) facts which are so notorious as not be the subject of dispute
    among reasonable persons; and (2) facts that are capable of immediate and
    accurate demonstration by resorting to readily accessible sources of indisputable
    accuracy: see Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (1992),
    at p. 976.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the motion judge noted, judicial notice may be taken of facts that are common
    knowledge within a community or a particular class of the community: <i>R
    v. Potts</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 219 (Ont. C.A.) at 228.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    a judge has jurisdiction to do so (see <i>R. v. Zundel</i> (1987), 31 C.C.C.
    (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) at 150, citing <i>McQuaker v. Goddard</i>, [1940] 1 K.B.
    687 (C.A.)), there is at least something slightly incongruous about having
    the trial of an issue to determine whether judicial notice can be taken of
    a fact.  If a matter is “so notorious as not to be the subject of dispute
    among reasonable persons” or is readily ascertainable by resort to reliable
    sources, one may be forgiven for asking why a trial is necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, we are not persuaded that the question of whether investment portfolio
    managers make use of asset-class swings in situations analogous to the administration
    of veterans’ pensions and allowances is so notorious as to be beyond dispute
    amongst reasonable persons.  Crown experts testified that such an investment
    strategy was not common in the industry and, in particular, that tactical
    asset allocation – varying asset mixes with a view to maximizing market return
    in a given time – was inappropriate for the veterans as it is an aggressive
    and risky investment strategy.  Experts called on behalf of the Class took
    a different view.  In short, there were differences of opinion.  The judicial
    notice issue cannot be resolved by choosing, and making findings, as between
    those differing opinions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that even the motion judge did not conclude that the fact that portfolio
    managers had the ability to shift asset allocations in a portfolio, within
    limits, met the <i>Williams</i> test.  Instead, he held that there was a “general
    acceptance”, although not a “universal acceptance” in the investment community
    of such a practice.  “General acceptance”
    will not suffice to ground judicial notice where, as here, there still remains
    a dispute amongst reasonable persons on the subject.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge concluded his reasons in this regard by holding (at para. 62):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While the general
    issue of judicial notice has been resolved in the affirmative, evidence and
    argument before me indicated more fully than the evidence and argument before
    my previous decision of December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2004, that <i>there are
    very real differences of opinion, and very real and cogent arguments over
    both the limits within which portfolio managers should be allowed to shift
    asset allocations,</i> and the reasons that a portfolio manager may validly
    have for making such shifts.  Underlying all of this is the obvious complete
    unfamiliarity in the financial community with the concept of applying hindsight
    to investment decisions, because of the obvious impossibility of being able
    to do so under the normal circumstances of financial decision making. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    leads us to another equally troubling problem in this case, and ultimately
    to the issue of the motion judge’s application of the hindsight principle
    to the assessment of damages.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    troubling problem is that it is not easy to determine where the taking of
    judicial notice ends and the resort to evidence before the motion judge on
    the issue of asset mix allocation begins.  If there is evidence it is not
    necessary to take judicial notice, which involves a judge relying upon his
    or her own knowledge or research.  Moreover, the range of permissible variations
    is as pivotal as the initial premise that such variations are allowed in
    the first place.  As the motion judge noted,
    “there are very real differences of opinion, and very real and cogent arguments
    over both the limits within which portfolio managers should be allowed to
    shift asset allocations and the reasons that a portfolio manager may validly
    have for making such shifts.”  But did he take judicial notice of these factors
    as well, since he had already decided upon the permissible range of asset
    mix variations before directing the trial of the issue?  Or, if not, did
    he adopt the permissible ranges from conflicting evidence before him on the
    summary judgment motion?  In either case, the procedure was flawed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s resort to judicial notice was unwarranted in the circumstances
    of this case.  And it made an enormous difference – $2.9 billion – in the
    damages assessed.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal;'>(b)       </span>The hindsight principle</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s central thesis on the assessment of damages was that the Crown
    ought to have invested the veterans’ funds in his model of a mixed portfolio,
    with a limited power to alter the asset mix, and with the full benefit of
    hindsight.  He pushed his hindsight analysis too far, however.  In effect,
    he imposed a standard of optimum maximization of gains on an annual basis
    for the entire period from 1916 to 1990.  No fiduciary or investment manager
    has ever achieved such perfection, and none ever will.  Even if the motion
    judge were correct in adopting his mixed asset portfolio theory, the Class
    was not entitled to expect such a high standard from the Crown.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has sanctioned the view that losses for breach of
    fiduciary duty may be assessed at the time of trial with the full benefit
    of hindsight: see <i>Guerin, supra </i>at 362; <i>Canson Enterprises Ltd.
    v. Boughton &amp;
    Co.,</i> [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534 at 554-55. <b> </b>However, the measure of damages
    for breach of fiduciary duty is <i>restitutionary</i>.  Plaintiffs are entitled
    to be placed in as good a position as they would have been in had the breach
    not occurred: <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377 at 440.  But
    they are not entitled to be placed in a <i>better</i> position, as the motion
    judge did here.  No authority has suggested that the hindsight principle
    may be used for such a purpose, and it would make no sense to do so because
    it would be inconsistent with the basis for recovery in a fiduciary obligation
    case.                                       </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet
    that is precisely what the motion judge did.  Based on the model he outlined,
    the Class had its expert, Professor Charette, formulate an algorithm to deal
    with the permitted swings as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(i) Pursuant to the simple terms of the algorithm, if an any given year:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) The return
    on bonds is greater than the return on equity and if the return on bonds
    is greater than the return on cash, then the asset mix would be 70% bonds,
    25% equities and 5% cash;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(ii) If the return on equity is greater than the return on bonds, and the return
    on equity is greater than the return on cash, then the asset mix would be
    50% bonds, 45% equities and 5% cash;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(iii) If the return on cash is greater than the return on bonds, and the return
    of bonds is greater than the return on equities, then the asset mix would
    be 55% bonds, 25% equities and 20% cash;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(iv) If the return on cash is greater than the return on equity, and the return
    on equity is greater than the return of bonds, then the asset mix would be
    50% bonds, 30% equities, and 20% cash.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown led evidence to show the probabilities of any investment manager generating
    the perfect hindsight returns envisaged by the motion judge.  The probability
    of doing so over a 10-year period was 1 in 595,000; over a 25-year period,
    1 in 273 trillion; and over an 85-year period, 1 in 12 followed by 48 zeros. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s approach to hindsight fails the reality test.  It is inconsistent
    with the restitutionary principle on which damages are awarded in fiduciary
    cases.  He should not have adopted it.</p>
