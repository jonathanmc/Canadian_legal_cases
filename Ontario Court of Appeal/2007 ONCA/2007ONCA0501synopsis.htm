<h1>Synopsis of <EM> Authorson Estate v. Canada (Attorney General) </EM></h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>In 1999, a large number of disabled World War I and II veterans brought a
  class action against the federal Crown. The Class claimed that the Crown had
  breached its fiduciary duty by failing to invest or pay interest on funds administered
  by the Crown for the veterans’ benefit. The Crown argued that the Class’s claim
  was barred by virtue of s. 5.1(4) of the <EM>Department of Veterans Affairs
  Act </EM>, which provides that no claim shall lie “for or on account of interest” on
  monies held by the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to 1990. </P>
<P>The action was divided into a liability phase and a damages phase. In 2000
  the motion judge, Justice John H. Brockenshire, held that the Crown was liable
  for breach of fiduciary duty and that s. 5.1(4) of the Act was inoperative
  because it conflicted with the <EM>Canadian Bill of Rights</EM>. The Court
  of Appeal for Ontario affirmed that decision in 2002. The motion judge proceeded
  to hear the damages phase of the action, but reserved his decision pending
  the Crown’s appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the liability issue. In
  2003 the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the Crown’s appeal, finding that s.
  5.1(4) was valid legislation and concluding that the Class had no claim for
  interest. </P>
<P>Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, the Class appeared
  before the motion judge and requested that he deliver his judgment on damages.
  The Class argued that the motion judge’s initial declaration that the Crown
  had breached its fiduciary duty had not been disturbed, and that the reach
  of both s. 5.1(4) of the Act and of the Supreme Court’s decision were limited
  to “interest” as distinct from damages for failure to invest. The motion judge
  agreed and directed further hearings to determine the quantum of damages for
  failure to invest. In 2005, the motion judge released the final damages decision,
  in which he assessed the Class’s damages at more than $4.6 billion. The Crown
  appealed this decision and a number of related judgments to this court. </P>
<P>In a judgment released today, the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Justices Moldaver,
  Sharpe and Blair) (“the Court”) unanimously allowed the Crown’s appeal. </P>
<H3>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</H3>
<P>The issues on appeal were: </P>
<OL>
  <LI> Did the motion judge err in failing to find that the Supreme Court’s liability
    judgment finally ended the litigation? </LI>
  <LI> Did the motion judge err in his interpretation of s. 5.1(4) as only a
    partial bar to the Class’s claim? </LI>
  <LI></LI>
  Did the motion judge err in finding that the Class’s claim was not time-barred?
  <LI> Did the motion judge err in his assessment of damages? </LI>
</OL>
<P>The Court answered each of these questions in the affirmative.
<P>First, the Court held that the judgment of the Supreme Court was final and
  binding and that there was no basis in fact or law for the Class to pursue
  its claim, or any aspect of it, once that judgment had been rendered. The Court
  reviewed the history of the proceeding and concluded that it had clearly been
  litigated on an “all or nothing” basis: either s. 5.1(4) of the Act barred
  the action in its entirety or it did not. The Court concluded that the motion
  judge should have recognized the Class motion for delivery of the judgment
  on damages following the Supreme Court’s ruling as a case of revisionism and
  dismissed it out of hand. </P>
<P>Second, the Court held that by enacting s. 5.1(4) of the <EM>Department of
    Veterans Affairs Act</EM>, Parliament clearly intended to bar any and all
    claims against the Crown for breach of its fiduciary duty to invest or pay
    interest on funds under its administration. The legislative framework which
    governed the Crown’s conduct during the relevant time period prevented it
    from investing public money in external markets or from paying anything but
    interest as an investment return. The words “for or on account of interest” in
    s. 5.1(4) were therefore all that was required to achieve a complete bar
    to any claim for failure to invest or pay interest. The Court concluded that
    the motion judge erred in interpreting s. 5.1(4) as only a partial bar to
    the Class’s claim. </P>
<P>Third, the Court held that the Crown was entitled to rely on the six-year
  limitation period set out in s. 32 of the <EM>Crown Liability and Proceedings
  Act </EM>, and that the Class’s cause of action was discoverable at least since
  s. 5.1(4) was enacted in 1990. The Court also held that the motion judge erred
  in finding that the Class’s claim was not time-barred by virtue of the doctrine
  of equitable fraud, which prevents a limitation period from operating as an “instrument
  of injustice”. The Court concluded that equitable fraud did not apply in this
  case for a number of reasons, including that there was no conduct on the part
  of the Crown that could be said to amount to “concealment” of the veterans’ rights
  to assert their fiduciary claims. </P>
<P>Finally, the Court held that the motion judge erred in the assessment of damages
  in at least two ways. First, the motion judge improperly took judicial notice
  of a disputed investment concept which resulted in an increase of $2.9 billion
  in the damage award to the Class. Second, the motion judge applied a standard
  of optimum maximization of gains on an annual basis for the entire period from
  1916 to 1990, which put the Class in a better position than they would have
  been in had the breach of fiduciary duty not occurred. This was inconsistent
  with the basis for recovery in a fiduciary obligation case, which is to put
  a plaintiff in as good a position as he or she would have been in but for the
  breach. </P>
