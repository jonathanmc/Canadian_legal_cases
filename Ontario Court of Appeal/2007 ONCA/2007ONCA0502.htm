    City of

w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oshawa replaced its licensing by-law for second-hand goods dealers on April
    24, 2004. The new by-law requires dealers of second-hand goods to submit
    electronically to police daily reports of all transactions, including detailed
    personal information about the vendors of each item. The by-law also requires
    dealers to pay an administrative fee for each report submitted. The application
    judge held that the by-law was validly enacted and did not contravene provincial
    privacy legislation. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>

    City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oshawa has been licensing dealers of second-hand goods since 1974. The original
    licensing by-law required every licensed dealer to maintain at the store
    a register of daily transactions. The record included particulars of each
    item purchased as well as the name, address and description of the person
    from whom the purchase was made. Between 1974 and 1983, these records were
    open to police inspection and the dealer was also required to deliver the
    information to the local police by 9 a.m. each day. In 1983 the by-law was
    amended to require dealers simply to maintain the register, which was subject
    to inspection by police. The purposes of the record inspection system were
    to help monitor by-law compliance and to assist police in the investigation
    and recovery of stolen property.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oshawa. In order to improve enforcement of the by law, it was recommended
    that the City eliminate both the manual recording of information and the
    need for police officers to attend the second-hand stores to review the records
    by replacing those procedures with a system of electronic collection and
    reporting of information by the dealers.</p>

    2001, c.&nbsp;25, which provides that a municipality may license, regulate
    and govern any business wholly or partly carried on within the municipality.

    the by-law sets out the City’s explanation of its reasons for licensing.
    Although the City makes reference to health and safety and nuisance control,
    it relies primarily on the consumer protection purpose as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The City of Oshawa
    has chosen to licence [<i>sic</i>], regulate and govern owners of second
    hand goods and salvage yard to enhance and encourage equal, fair and courteous
    treatment of customers, protect the property of customers, ensure products
    made available for resale are not stolen, promote accountability, and support
    proper and good business practices.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This reason relates
    to consumer protection as licensing and regulation aim to prevent, mitigate
    or redress losses to, or practices which might negatively impact on second
    hand goods and salvage yard owners and members of the public.</p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Cash Converters Canada Inc. is the Canadian franchisor or the Cash
    Converters chain of second-hand stores. The appellant 1151245 is a Cash Converters
    franchisee and carries on business as a licensed dealer of second-hand goods
    in the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Oshawa. The appellants brought an application to quash the provisions of
    the by-law set out above on the ground that they exceed the statutory and
    constitutional authority of the municipality. The appellants also argued
    that the impugned provisions conflict with both federal and provincial privacy
    legislation and that they are discriminatory insofar as they apply only to
    some dealers of second-hand goods. Finally, the appellants submitted that
    the transaction fee is invalid because it exceeds the cost of administering
    and enforcing the by-law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected all of the appellants’
    arguments. He held that the by-law was properly rooted in the province’s
    property and civil rights power and was not in relation to criminal law;
    that it was authorized under s. 150 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>; and
    that it was not discriminatory. He further held that the by-law did not conflict
    with federal or provincial privacy laws, and that the challenge to the transaction
    fee was premature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to this court, the appellants maintain that the by-law exceeds the
    city’s legislative competence and violates provincial privacy legislation.

    nature and effect and are aimed at the suppression of conditions that may
    lead to the commission of crimes. Specifically, the identification of the
    person from whom a second hand dealer acquires a second hand good, the matching
    of that information to particulars of the second hand good acquired and the
    collection of the record on behalf of the city are intended to discourage
    unscrupulous individuals from transacting business with second hand dealers.

    related to the consumer protection objective of the by-law because vendors
    of second-hand goods “are less likely to be unscrupulous if they know the
    records are being collected in a timely and effective fashion.” She identifies
    paragraph 22.(a) of the impugned by-law, which is the paragraph that allows
    the city clerk to require a dealer to transmit the records to the police
    daily or in some circumstances, in real time, as a provision directly aimed

    other words, the city justifies the new by-law on the same basis as the one
    it replaced, as consumer protection legislation that protects dealers and
    their customers by collecting information about the vendors of second-hand
    goods. It is the collection of this information that deters those who deal
    in stolen property from trying to sell such goods to licensed dealers. The
    new features of the by-law enhance or improve the information collection

    the second-hand goods, including a photograph and three pieces of official
    identification that many people would not ordinarily carry, and to transmit
    that information electronically to the police at least daily if not in real
    time. The appellants states that in this way, “the by-law gives the police
    access to sensitive profiling information on a targeted, partly low-income
    group of consumers, for unlimited uses including criminal investigation and
    prosecution, without search warrant protection, judicial supervision or any
    legal safeguards whatsoever.” </p>

    the system described in the by-law for use by the city and the local police.
    Its system allows the police to collect for their own use the data required
    by the by-law about each person who sells any second-hand good to a dealer.

    of the system to the city.</p>

    proper approach to the interpretation of municipal powers has recently been
    discussed by the Supreme Court and followed by this court in such cases as <i>114957
    Canada Ltee (Spraytech, Societe d’arrosage) v. Hudson (Town)</i>, [2001]
    2 S.C.R. 241; <i>Croplife Canada v. Toronto</i>, (2005) 75 O.R. (3d) 357

    of Southern Alberta v. Calgary (City)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 485. The question
    whether a by-law is <i>ultra vires</i> the jurisdiction of the enacting municipality
    is a question of law which is reviewed on the standard of correctness. However,
    in determining the question, courts are to take a broad and purposive approach
    to the construction and interpretation of municipal powers. See <i>United
    Taxi </i>at para 6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that under the 2001 version of the <i>Municipal Act</i> pursuant
    to which this by-law was passed, the municipality’s licensing power can be
    exercised only for the three purposes set out in s. 150(2). In <i>Toronto
    Taxi</i>, the application judge had concluded that the city had not shown
    that Toronto’s new taxi cab licensing by law was enacted for the purposes
    of health and safety and consumer protection as asserted by the city and
    that the real purpose was to “re-engineer the taxi-cab industry in order
    to eliminate middlemen and to redistribute revenues generated by the industry
    in favour of active participants.” This court disagreed with the narrow approach
    taken by the application judge. The court reviewed the Task Force Report
    that led to the enactment of the by-law and concluded that the report provided
    both a factual basis and a rational connection between the means chosen to
    overhaul the taxi licensing system and the health and safety and consumer
    protection objectives of the city. The court acknowledged that these objectives
    would only be indirect effects of the new system but deferred to the municipality
    on the issue of the potential effectiveness of its legislative initiatives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a similar approach should be taken in this case. I agree with the
    applicants that there is no suggestion that the former licensing by-law was
    ineffective or that the new and much more onerous provisions regarding the
    collection and transmittal to the police of personal information about vendors
    of second-hand goods is a necessary addition to the by-law for the consumer
    protection purpose. It appears that what drove the adoption of this new licensing
    by-law was the initiative of the BWI software vendor together with the desire
    of the police to be able to obtain this information for their database electronically
    without attending personally at the dealers’ premises.</p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the fundamental premise that collection of information about the goods and
    the vendors may deter unscrupulous vendors from attempting to sell stolen
    goods can be seen as a form of consumer protection by helping to keep stolen
    goods out of the marketplace and possibly thereby deterring those who may
    be inclined to steal goods for that purpose. As this court stated in <i>Toronto
    Taxi</i>, referring to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>Nanaimo
    (City) v. Rascal Trucking Ltd</i>. [200] 1 S.C.R. 342, “A reviewing court
    should not second-guess the municipality as to whether the by-law will be
    more or less effective in achieving the intended purpose or purposes” (para.

    protection” a broad and generous interpretation that allows the municipality
    to achieve its legitimate interests (see <i>Croplife </i>at para. 37), I
    am satisfied that the enactment of this by-law fell within the municipality’s
    authority and is not <i>ultra vires</i>. I would therefore not give effect

    exceptions from the rights set out in the act should be interpreted narrowly,
    with any doubt resolved in favour of preserving the right and with the burden

    specific concerns respecting government data banks: (1) where government
    collects personal information, the individual is unlikely to have an effective
    choice to refuse to supply the information; (2) because its activity is so
    broad, government holds very extensive personal information about individuals;
    (3) there is public anxiety about government agencies sharing their holdings
    of personal information and building comprehensive personal files on individuals
    (<i>Public Government for Private People: The Report of the Commission on
    Freedom of Information and Protection of Individual Privacy/1980</i>, Vol.
    3 (Toronto: Queen’s Printer, 1980) at<i> </i>pp. 504-505). The commission
    concluded that </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>a privacy protection

      (1) can a person simultaneously comply with both provisions (the “impossibility
      of dual compliance” test), and (2) does the provincial provision frustrate
      Parliament’s purpose in enacting the federal provision? In <i>Croplife</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>this

    that test, the application judge found that the by-law does not conflict
    with s. 28(2) of <i>MFIPPA</i>. He cited three rationales for his conclusion.
    He first found that the first prong of the test is met so long as the information
    is collected on consent. He also concluded, based on s. 22(e) of Schedule “A” to
    the by law, which provides that the City Clerk may prescribe procedures “to
    ensure compliance with <i>MFIPPA</i> …”, that the by-law expressly anticipates
    and provides for compliance with privacy laws. He found that the second prong
    of the test was met because there was no evidence that the information transmission
    requirements of the by-law frustrated the legislative purpose of MFIPPA.
    Finally he concluded that the collection of personal information by licensed
    second-hand dealers complies with s. 28(2) on the basis that it is “expressly
    authorized by statute”, because the by-law is authorized by s. 150(2) of

    Consent is not one of the three conditions set out in s. 28(2) that allow
    the collection of personal information by or on behalf of a municipality.
    This was observed by the Commissioner in Investigation I94-068P,<i> Ministry
    of Community and Social Services</i>, [1995] O.I.P.C. No. 534. In contrast,
    where the legislature wishes any aspect of the act to operate based on consent
    it has so provided. See, for instance, the provisions regarding disclosure
    of certain information under s. 10(2), 14(1)(a) and 32(b), the manner of
    collection under s.&nbsp;29(1) or the use of certain information under s.
    31(a). I also agree with the appellants that contrary to the observation
    of the application judge, there is evidence in the record that some people
    who sell second-hand goods require the proceeds to meet their daily needs
    and therefore, when faced with the choice of providing the information or
    not selling the goods, cannot confidently be said to be giving their consent

    example, s. 9 of the <i>Pawnbrokers Act</i> specifically obliges a pawnbroker
    to keep a book with the full name, address and description of the person
    who pawns an article sufficient to identify the person as well as details
    of the person’s identification or a note that the person did not produce
    identification, and s. 13 requires pawnbrokers to make a daily report of
    the information to the chief of police or the person designated by by-law.
    There is no similar provision in the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>. The structure
    of the Act indicates that it was not the intention of the legislature to
    allow municipalities, simply by virtue of their power to enact by-laws, to
    determine the type of personal information that can be collected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    28(2) also allows personal information to be collected on behalf of an institution
    if the information is “used for the purposes of law enforcement.” Of significant
    concern in this case is the wholesale transmission to the police of a significant
    amount of personal information about individuals. This transmission occurs
    before there is any basis to suspect that the goods that were sold to the
    second-hand dealer were stolen and is made with no limit as to its use by
    the police or by those to whom the police may share the information. Although
    some of the information collected may ultimately be used for law enforcement,
    the purpose of the by-law and its intent in obliging vendors of second-hand
    goods to disclose so much personal information and transmitting all of it
    to the police is for consumer protection and not law enforcement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    City’s main position on the appeal is that the reason the by-law does not
    conflict with s. 28(2) of the <i>MFIPPA</i> is because it meets the third
    criterion of the section: the collection of the personal information under
    the by-law is “necessary to the proper administration of a lawfully authorized
    activity”, that is, the administration of the licensing of second-hand goods
    dealers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    the jurisprudence developed by the Privacy Commissioner interpreting this
    provision is both helpful and persuasive of the proper approach to be taken
    by the courts as well. In cases decided by the Commissioner’s office, it
    has required that in order to meet the necessity condition, the institution
    must show that each item or class of personal information that is to be collected
    is necessary to properly administer the lawfully authorized activity. Consequently,
    where the personal information would merely be helpful to the activity, it
    is not “necessary” within the meaning of the Act. Similarly, where the purpose
    can be accomplished another way, the institution is obliged to choose the
    other route. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner’s approach in complaints that come before her office is to examine
    in detail the types of information being collected and to determine whether
    each type is necessary for the collecting institution’s activity. For example,
    in <i>Re Toronto Community Housing Corp.</i>, [2004] O.I.P.C. No. 196, the
    Commissioner received a complaint from a tenant that the housing corporation
    was requiring tenants who wanted parking stickers to provide copies of vehicle
    insurance and ownership papers which the tenant said was not authorized by
    the lease. The corporation justified its action because it wanted to address
    problems of break-ins, vandalism and illegally parked cars. These problems
    were caused by tenants who abused the parking system by renting out spaces
    to non-residents who then gained access to the building and parked in other
    residents’ allocated parking spots. Also people were vandalizing the entry
    system mechanism, which then required costly repairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner considered individually the requirements to provide vehicle
    ownership documentation and vehicle insurance verification. The Commissioner
    determined that the ownership documents were necessary so that corporation
    staff could see that cars parked in the garage were owned by the tenants
    themselves. However, the Commissioner was not satisfied that the corporation
    needed the insurance information to properly administer the parking program
    and found that collection of the insurance information was not in compliance
    with s. 28(2) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same approach is taken by other provincial privacy commissions. For example,
    in <i>Re</i> <i>Rick Arsenault Enterprises</i>, [2005] A.I.P.C.D. No. 45,
    the Alberta Information and Privacy Commissioner received a complaint that
    a Canadian Tire store, a provincially regulated organization under the jurisdiction
    of the Commissioner, had refused to complete a return of goods without obtaining
    certain personal information including the driver’s licence number of the
    person returning the goods.  As in the case on appeal, the stated purpose
    of collecting the information was to deter fraud. The evidence was that the
    store acknowledged that simply authenticating and confirming the identity
    of the individual returning the goods was sufficient for their purposes.
    The commission viewed this as a concession that the collection and retention
    of driver’s licence numbers was not necessary for deterring fraud and therefore
    was not permitted under the Act. See also <i>Re K.E. Gostlin Enterprises</i> <i>Ltd</i>,
    [2005] B.C.I.P.C.D. No. 18 (British Columbia Information and Privacy Commissioner).</p>

line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    intervener provided the court with many examples of decisions of the Ontario
    Commissioner under the necessity criterion where the Commissioner examined
    each piece or category of personal information being collected by the public
    institution and the reason for collecting it, and determined for each whether
    that collection was necessary in order to properly administer the activity
    that the institution was carrying on. If it was not, the institution was
    prohibited from collecting the information. See for example: A Public School
    Board, [1994] O.I.P.C. No. 457; A College of Applied Arts and Technology,
    [1995] O.I.P.C. No. 546; A Board of Education, [1996] O.I.P.C. No. 449; Ministry
    of Natural Resources, [1994] O.I.P.C. No. 447; Re Sarnia Police Service,
    [2005] O.I.P.C. No. 28; Ministry of Housing, [1995] O.I.P.C. No. 315; A Municipality,

line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this same approach to the interpretation and application of the
    necessity criterion in s. 28(2) ought to be employed by the court. The Commissioner’s
    approach is both logical and effective in implementing the purposes of the
    privacy legislation. By using the same approach, the effect is to apply the
    Act in the same way whether an issue arises by complaint to the commission
    or in this context, where the court is asked to determine a conflict between,
    in this case, a by-law and <i>MFIPPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using
    that approach, the issue is whether the city has satisfied its onus to demonstrate
    that both the collection of all of the information and identification required
    by the by-law, as well as the daily transmission of that information to the
    police for storage in their data bank, is necessary for an effective consumer
    protection regime to license second-hand dealers that deters people from
    dealing in stolen goods. Both must be justified because it is clear that
    the by-law is structured to operate as a co-ordinated scheme that includes
    both the collection and the daily transmission of all the information to
    the police for storage in their data bank.</p>

    her affidavit filed on behalf of the city, the Deputy City Clerk deposes
    that in a 2003 report for the city by its commissioner of corporate services,
    the commissioner identified two issues, manual record- keeping and the burden
    on the police, as reasons to consider electronic-computerized procedures
    to improve the enforcement of the by-law then in existence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Deputy City Clerk states that the collection of identity information from
    vendors of second-hand goods is aimed at suppressing crime and is intended
    to discourage unscrupulous people from transacting business with second-hand
    dealers. If such people know that the records are being collected in a timely
    and effective fashion, they are less likely to be unscrupulous.</p>

line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of this evidence is that the new provisions are intended to improve
    the old system by modernizing the recording of the information using computers
    and by making the system easier for the police to administer because they
    receive the information electronically on a daily basis without travelling
    to the second-hand stores. However, it is clear that there is no attempt
    to say that the new provisions are necessary for administering the licensing
    system or for its effectiveness. In contrast, in the <i>Toronto Taxi Alliance
    v. City of Toronto</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 5460 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) the city had two task force reports that discussed the problem with taxi
    licenses and how the new by-law would address the problem.</p>

    appellants point out that there is no evidence to suggest that there is a
    growing problem in the municipality regarding the sale of stolen goods to
    second-hand dealers. On the contrary, there were only 30 suspected stolen

    the

line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the new by-law is to facilitate the collection and electronic recording
    of detailed, identifying information about persons, mostly innocent but some
    unscrupulous, including their photograph and details of three pieces of identification
    as well as the time of their visit to the store and the nature of the goods
    offered for sale. This information is then transmitted and stored in a police
    database and available for use and transmission by the police without any
    restriction and without any judicial oversight. The intent of <i>MFIPPA</i> is
    to ensure that the collection and retention of private information is strictly
    controlled and justified.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the evidence in this application, the city has not demonstrated that the
    impugned provisions of the new by-law that mandate the collection and electronic
    transmission to police of detailed personal information about vendors of
    second-hand goods, is necessary for an effective consumer protection regime
    to license second-hand dealers. Given my conclusions that the impugned provisions
    in the new by-law do not come within the exceptions in s. 28(2) of <i>MFIPPA</i>,
    I am of the view that the application judge erred in law in his application
    of the <i>Rothman</i>’s test.<i></i></p>

    this application, the city effectively took an “all or nothing approach” to
    the by-law, and did not seek to justify the provisions clause by clause.
    As a result, I would declare the challenged sections of Schedule A to the
    by-law: ss.10(c), (d), 15, 20, 22 (a), and  (b) to be “of no effect” under
    s. 14 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>.<i></i></p>

    conclusion does not preclude the city from enacting a new second-hand goods
    dealers’ licensing by-law with provisions regarding the collection and transmission
    of some personal information that it may well be able to justify under s.
    28(2). I would note that s. 46(a) of <i>MFIPPA</i> allows the Commissioner
    to “offer comment on the privacy protection implications of proposed programs
    of institutions.” There is much merit, in my view, for a city to make use
    of this provision to have any proposed new by-law vetted through a detailed
    examination of each provision and the necessity for it by the Commissioner
    at first instance, rather than by a court. The Commissioner has both the
    expertise and the experience in addressing these types of issues and can
    do so in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than a court.<i></i></p>

    on s. 150(9) that restricts the total fees that can be charged for a license
    to the “costs directly related to the administration and enforcement of the
    by-law….” The appellants challenge s 22(f) on the basis that it does not
    specifically authorize a volumetric fee as required by the Supreme Court

    it will do so under the new <i>Municipal Act</i> that came into effect on
