style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This saga began when the appellant police
    officer used a small amount of force, later found to be unauthorized, to escort
    the respondent, Mr. Bapoo, into a courthouse.  Initially, Mr. Bapoo swore a private information charging the officers
    with assault and public mischief.  The
    Crown took carriage of those proceedings but subsequently withdrew the public
    mischief charges.  Ultimately the charges
    of assault were stayed for delay pursuant to the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants then brought a claim for damages
    for, <i>inter alia</i>, malicious
    prosecution against Mr. Bapoo, the Ontario Crown, the Attorney General and two
    individual Crown attorneys.  Mr. Bapoo
    counterclaimed against the appellants for assault and breach of his <i>Charter</i> rights under s. 7.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge dismissed the appellants’
    malicious prosecution action.  He allowed
    Mr. Bapoo’s counterclaim for breach of his <i>Charter</i> rights and awarded damages.  The
    appellants appeal both the dismissal of their claims and the awards of damages
    in favour of Mr. Bapoo to this court.</p>
  <h4>Malicious Prosecution</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal against the trial judge’s dismissal
    of the appellants’ claims for malicious prosecution is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution,
    a plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with malice:  <i>Nelles
    v. Ontario</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170.  The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence carefully and found that none of the
    defendants were actuated by malice.  There was substantial evidence to support those findings.  None of the errors that the appellants submit
    the trial judge made relate to his finding that there was no malice. </p>
  <h4>Section 24(1) Damages</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next, we turn to the appeal against the trial
    judge’s awards of damages in favour of Mr. Bapoo under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  That appeal is allowed and the awards of damages are set aside.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that Mr. Bapoo had been
    assaulted, but that his claim based on common law assault was time-barred under
    s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38.  As to the <i>Charter</i> claim, the trial judge found
    that the appellants did not have the authority to apply force to Mr. Bapoo when
    they brought him into the courthouse and, as such, they breached his s. 7 right
    to security of the person.  The trial
    judge ordered that each appellant pay Mr. Bapoo $2,500 in damages pursuant to
    s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  While the trial judge concluded that the
    appellants believed that they had authority to use force to escort Mr. Bapoo,
    he found that they did not have that authority.  Thus, on the trial judge’s findings, the appellants did not act with <i>mala fides</i> nor did they wilfully breach
    Mr. Bapoo’s <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge went on to hold that <i>mala fides</i> or wilfulness to breach the <i>Charter</i> were not essential prerequisites
    to awarding damages as a remedy under s. 24(1).  Subsequent to the release of the trial judge’s reasons, this court
    delivered judgment in <i>Ferri v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney
    General)</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 397.  At
    para. 108, LaForme J.A., writing for the majority, held that liability for a
    constitutional tort under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> requires proof of wilfulness or <i>mala
    fides</i>.  He said the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Liability for a
    constitutional tort, such as under ss. 6 and 7 of the <i>Charter</i> as claimed here by Ferri<i> </i>and Mammoliti, requires wilfulness or <i>mala
    fides</i> in the creation of a risk or course of conduct that leads to
    damages.  Proof of simple negligence is
    not sufficient for an award of damages in an action under the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>McGillivary v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i> (1994), 116 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    104 at 108 (N.B.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 408.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Juriansz J.A., who dissented on other points, concurred
    with the majority on the need for <i>mala
    fides</i> or wilfulness as a prerequisite for an award of damages for a
    constitutional tort under the <i>Charter</i> (para. 167).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the basis of this court’s decision in <i>Ferri</i>, we conclude that the trial judge erred
    in awarding damages to Mr. Bapoo for his <i>Charter</i> claim.  We therefore allow the appeal
    against the counterclaim and quash the awards of damages made below.</p>
  <h4>Notice of Constitutional Claim</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given our conclusion in the preceding paragraph,
    it is not necessary to deal with the appellants’ other arguments attacking the
    awards of damages except for one.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants submit that Mr. Bapoo’s
    counterclaim should have been dismissed because he failed to give notice to the
    Attorney General for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    of a constitutional claim as required by s. 109(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  They argue that had the Attorney General been
    given notice, that would have fundamentally altered the way the Attorney
    General conducted the litigation both with respect to the counterclaim and the
    main proceeding relating to malicious prosecution.  Thus, they say that the failure to give notice
    under s. 109(1) must result in a new trial on both the counterclaim and the
    malicious prosecution claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept this argument.  The Attorney General was present throughout
    the trial and had effective notice of the <i>Charter</i> claim and the counterclaim.  On this
    appeal, the Attorney General accepts that he received adequate notice of the <i>Charter</i> claim.  Assuming, however, for the sake of the
    argument that the Attorney General did not receive notice as required by s. 109(1),
    we see no merit to the appellants’ argument that there must be a new
    trial.  The submission that the course of
    the trial may have been altered is premised on the notion that the Attorney
    General would have taken a different position at trial with respect to the
    alleged assault upon Mr. Bapoo.  This
    notion is entirely speculative.  Indeed,
    as counsel for the Attorney General points out, the Attorney General’s position
    at trial was based on the evidence as counsel assessed it.  There is no reason to think that the same
    position would not have been advanced even if Mr. Bapoo had given a s. 109(1)
    notice.</p>
  <h4>Costs </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, we deal with the issue of the trial
    judge’s award of costs.  The trial judge
    awarded costs to all of the defendants at trial on the malicious prosecution
    claim on a substantial indemnity basis.  In addition, he awarded costs in favour of Mr. Bapoo on the counterclaim
    on a substantial indemnity basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants challenge the award in favour of
    Mr. Bapoo arguing that it was based primarily on an unfair and inappropriate
    finding by the trial judge that they had perjured themselves when giving
    evidence at trial.  They argue that they
    should have only been required to pay Mr. Bapoo’s costs on a partial indemnity
    scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree with the appellants’ submission that
    the trial judge’s characterization of the appellants’ testimony as perjury was
    too strong.  The trial judge found that
    the appellants committed perjury in his reasons for judgment.  However, the parties had not clearly raised
    the issue of perjury either during the course of evidence or in closing submissions.  When cross-examined, the appellants were not
    challenged on the basis that they were perjuring themselves.  In closing submissions, counsel for Mr. Bapoo
    submitted that the trial judge should reject or disbelieve the evidence of the
    appellants but he did not go so far as to ask the trial judge to make a finding
    of perjury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the trial judge set out his
    basis for rejecting the appellants’ evidence and for preferring the evidence of
    others in several instances.  We think,
    however, that in the circumstances, it was not appropriate for the trial judge
    to go further and to affix the criminal label “perjury” to the appellants’
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, we are not satisfied that the trial
    judge’s award of substantial indemnity costs in favour of Mr. Bapoo in relation
    to the malicious prosecution claim should be set aside.  The finding of perjury was one of the factors
    that led the trial judge to award costs on the higher scale.  Our reading of the trial judge’s reasons
    indicates that even without the finding of perjury, he would have made the same
    order.  A trial judge has a broad
    discretion as to the scale of costs to be applied.  We see no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s award in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given that the appellants have succeeded on the
    counterclaim in this court, it is necessary to address the award of costs at
    trial in favour of Mr. Bapoo.  A
    reasonable estimate is that the counterclaim consumed approximately 25 per cent
    of the trial time.  The appellants should
    receive their costs at trial on the counterclaim on a partial indemnity
    scale.  Accordingly, we reduce the costs award
    in favour of Mr. Bapoo at trial by 40 per cent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to costs of the appeal, we deal first with Mr.
    Bapoo’s unsuccessful motion to quash the appeal.  We direct that Mr. Bapoo pay the appellants
    costs fixed in the amount of $3,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  As to the appeal proper, we have now
    considered the written material filed by the parties in a sealed envelope,
    which included the appellants’ offers to settle the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Attorney General was entirely successful on
    the appeal.  The appellants are directed
    to pay the Attorney General’s costs on a partial indemnity scale fixed in the
    amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As between the appellants and Mr. Bapoo, there
    has been divided success.  Accordingly,
    we make no order as to costs with respect to the appeal.</p>
