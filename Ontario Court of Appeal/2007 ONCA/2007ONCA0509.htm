    is an appeal from the decision of Blenus Wright J., which dismissed the appellants’ action

    four appellant onion growers, who farmed in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bradford region, applied Dyfonate when they planted their onion crops in
    the spring of 1995.  In the trial judge’s view, the unusually cool and dry
    spring that year delayed the life cycle of the onion maggot.  By the time
    the maggots emerged to feast on the onion crops, Dyfonate was not successful
    in protecting the appellants’
    onion crops from infestation.  The appellants lost thirty to sixty percent
    of their crops.  </p>

    the trial judge’s view, the appellants, all of whom were hard-working, experienced
    and sophisticated onion growers, were aware that damage could result in the
    face of unusual weather conditions.  However, that same season, onion crops
    in the region planted with Lorsban<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial, which lasted fourteen days and was followed by extensive written argument,
    included evidence from the appellant onion growers, Zeneca representatives,
    individuals involved in the investigation of the crop failure, and the parties’ respective
    experts.  Based on this evidence, the trial judge concluded that the cause
    of the crop failure was environmental conditions.  On this basis, the trial
    judge referred to the appellants’ legal arguments, which were based on the <i>Sale
    of Goods Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. S-1 (SGA) and negligence, but did not analyze
    those arguments because he held that this case rested not on “a determination
    of legal issues but on findings of fact.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    finding that the crop failure was not caused by any defect in Dyfonate, but
    predominantly by an unusually cool and dry spring, the trial judge accepted
    the evidence of the respondents’ expert entomologist, Dr. Grafius.  The trial
    judge found Dr. Grafius to have “extensive knowledge and experience with
    the onion maggot problem” and described him as “probably
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North America’s foremost expert” on onion maggots.  He noted that Dr. Grafius
    had “extensive experience over many, many years, since he was 15 years old,
    with respect to onions and onion maggots and the insecticides that apply
    to try to control the onion maggot.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    Grafius explained that the unusual climate affected the soil conditions,
    causing a delayed development and emergence of the onion maggot.  As a result,
    the first generation onion maggot egg-laying pressure in the Holland/Bradford
    Marsh region peaked<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>.  Significantly, the scientific and expert evidence
    also indicated that, in contrast to the typical week-long fly peak in 1994,
    the 1995 peak extended for ten to fourteen days in the area generally.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also relied upon the similar conclusion of an <i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i> committee
    (the Committee), which was struck in the summer of 1995 to determine the
    cause of the crop failures.  The Committee was comprised of Jim Chaput (an
    entomologist and the Pest Management Advisor at Ontario Ministry of Agriculture
    and Food (OMAF)), Dr. Mary Ruth McDonald (manager of OMAF’s Muck Research
    Station (Research Station) in the region and the holder of a doctorate that
    emphasized plant pathology), Gwen Ritcey (a University of Guelph research
    associate), and Jim Anderson (Zeneca’s Product Service Supervisor).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Committee reached its conclusion after eliminating other potential factors,
    such as an insufficient quantity of the active ingredient, fonofos, in the
    Dyfonate sold to the appellants.  The Committee also determined that no unusual
    resistance developed to Dyfonate that season and there was no unusual microbial
    degradation.  The Committee thus determined that the unusual 1995 environmental
    climate was the “predominate factor”
    explaining the crop failure. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> At
    para. 36 of his reasons, the trial judge quoted the Committee report on causation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This leaves only environmental conditions as the
    predominate factor to consider. Dry, cool conditions are known to reduce
    the activity of Dyfonate in soils. Weather records for 1995 do indicate our
    area was significantly cooler than average and slightly drier than previous
    years. We also had a dry fall and winter in 1994-95. The cool temperatures
    meant a delayed germination pattern and a delayed onion maggot emergence
    pattern. In 1995 onion maggot egg laying pressure peaked near the end of
    June, almost 60 days from seeding time (May 1). In 1994 peak egg laying occurred
    around June 10 only 40 days from seeding time.  Based on rates of degradation
    from previous years, it is believed that by the time onion maggot pressure
    was at a peak in 1995 the product had degraded to low levels. This is a normal
    process for granular materials. Dyfonate normally degrades slightly faster
    than Lorsban, but has been a very active insecticide until this year.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants called a qualified chemist as their expert, but his opinion that
    Dyfonate was defective was rejected by the trial judge because the chemist
    had no experience either with onion growing or with the use of insecticides
    to control the onion maggot.  In addition, even though the chemist testified
    that Dyfonate was an inadequate insecticide, his analysis showed it to be
    superior to Lorsban in certain tests.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  In any event, the appellants’ expert opinion
    was necessarily limited to the quality of Dyfonate; he was not qualified
    to give evidence about other factors causing the crop failure.  The appellants
    called no other expert evidence.  As the trial judge concluded at para. 32
    of his reasons, the appellants’ expert evidence “was of no assistance to
    the [appellants]” and a “major failure of the [appellants’] case is the lack
    of expert evidence to support their position.”</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    soil in which the onion crops are planted contain pupae that remain dormant
    over the winter and emerge, usually in May, as an adult fly.  Five to seven
    days after emergence, the fly mates.  Three to four days after that, the
    fly lays its eggs, usually around the base of the onion plant.  The eggs
    hatch in three to five days, or a little later if the soil is cold, and the
    larvae descend to the onion root.  If the maggot comes into contact with
    an effective application of insecticide, it dies.  If it does not, the maggot
    proceeds to feast on the onion root.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Feasting
    on the onion root can kill the onion plant.  Accordingly, treatment of the
    onion maggots, which were a persistent and challenging pest, was important
    to prevent significant damage to onion crops.  Only two insecticides, Lorsban
    and Dyfonate, were available at the time to control the important first generation
    of onion maggots.  Normally, both provided effective control.  However, to
    the knowledge of everyone, neither insecticide was perfect.  Even if the
    insecticide was applied properly, growers generally experienced an overall
    crop loss of five per cent, and sometimes up to ten per cent, with different
    fields experiencing different ranges of damage well in excess of those amounts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    recommended by the manufacturers, growers applied Dyfonate or Lorsban at
    the same time as they planted their onions seeds.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  The amount of insecticide recommended by the
    manufacturer must be in an amount that controls the maggots, but does not
    damage the seeds and yet ensures that no residue remains at harvest time
    in either the crop or the soil.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    1993, growers used Lorsban, which was the only available viable insecticide.  However,
    to be effective, the growers had to apply Lorsban in quantities that significantly
    exceeded those recommended on its label.  Furthermore, using the same insecticide
    each year increased the chance that the maggots would develop resistance
    to the product.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dyfonate,
    which had been reformulated from earlier versions, became available in the
    early 1990’s.  It presented an attractive alternative to Lorsban because
    it allowed farmers to rotate which insecticide they used from year to year
    and from plot to plot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1992, OMAF’s integrated pest management program (IPM program) conducted studies
    on growers’ fields, which showed that onion crops treated with Lorsban suffered
    overall damage of 2.9 per cent, with a range of damage of between zero to
    thirty-three per cent.  Although Dyfonate was not yet commercially available,
    1992 tests conducted at the Research Station showed Dyfonate to be more effective
    than Lorsban in controlling first generation onion maggots.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    1993, although Lorsban-treated fields suffered overall damage of 7.7 per
    cent, damage in some fields was as high as twenty-five percent.  In the same
    year, Dyfonate-treated fields suffered overall damage of 4.75 per cent, with
    a range that showed damage up to 11.25 per cent in some fields.  Dr. McDonald
    testified that these results represented typical ranges for treated fields.  This
    season, in contrast, the Research Station experimental tests showed Lorsban
    to be more effective than Dyfonate. </p>

    appellants contend that the expert evidence about environmental causes of
    the crop failure was contradicted by the four appellant growers, who testified
    to visible crop damage in their fields as early as late May and early to
    mid-June, damage that they contend is inconsistent with the delayed emergence
    explanation that anchored the opinions of Dr. Grafius and the Committee.  </p>

    as the appellants argue, damage was visible in late May and early June, delayed
    emergence was irrelevant to the crop failure.  On the other hand, if the
    damage was not visible until the end of June or early July, the weather conditions
    could explain the crop failure.  The date damage was first visible is significant
    because it is an indication of when the damage to the onion plants actually
    occurred, which in turn could signal whether Dyfonate was effective at the
    particular time.</p>

    trial judge did not explicitly deal with the growers’ evidence about the
    timing of crop damage to the appellants’

    the growers’ evidence is implicit in his acceptance of the expert evidence.  I
    agree for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    Mr. Anderson of Zeneca and Dr. McDonald of the Research Station gave evidence
    that damage would be visible ten to fifteen days after the maggots attacked
    the onion root.  However, Dr. McDonald said visibility varies over a wide
    time frame depending on a number of factors, including the size of the onion
    and the number of maggots feeding on any individual onion.  Dr. Grafius,
    who gave the expert opinion preferred by the trial judge, disagreed with
    the ten-day figure as a general statement and testified that damage could
    be apparent “much sooner”, depending on a number of factors, including the
    size of the plant, the number of maggots involved, and the soil temperature.  Wilting,
    he testified, will be apparent in a small onion plant within a short time;
    however, if a very large plant is attacked by only one maggot, damage will
    be visible as late as ten or, at most, fifteen days after the attack. Dr.
    Grafius’
    opinion was consistent with the OMAF fact sheet that describes first generation
    onion maggot damage being visible from “mid-to-late June as wilted onion
    seedlings.”  The appellants called no expert evidence that contradicted the
    opinion of Dr. Grafius on this issue.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants recalled visible damage in late May and early June.  On
    this point, Dr. Grafius testified that evidence of <i>some</i> early damage
    was not inconsistent with his opinion.  Even with the application of either
    insecticide, damage to fifteen percent of the early crop might be visible
    in any given field, even if overall damage during the season totalled no
    more than five percent.  Accordingly, on the evidence presented at trial,
    the fact of some damage in late May and early June did not indicate an early
    failure of Dyfonate in advance of the delayed emergence.  On this issue,
    Dr. Grafius testified that damage this early in the season would raise questions
    primarily about application methods and resistance problems. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the appellants’ recollections at trial about the visibility of damage were
    not consistent with their 1995 reports of damage.  For example, although
    Mr. Horodynsky gave evidence about early and extensive damage, he only reported
    “more onion maggot than normal” to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bradford in mid-to-late June.  He did not report damage to his insurer until

    was either serious or extensive.  Further, only on June 22 did Mr. Horodynsky
    purchase and apply Lorsban spray to his fields.  Mr. Horodynsky’s lack of
    action until June 22 conflicts with his recollection of extensive visible
    damage in late May and early June.<span

    Mr. Conceicao purchased Lorsban spray on June 27 and Mr. Smith on June 26,
    indicating that, only at that point, did they consider the damage to be extensive.  As
    well, while Mr. Dyriw gave evidence that he first noticed damage to his crop
    in mid-to-late June, he did not report that damage to his insurer on June
    13, when he was making a claim for wind damage.</p>

    first documented evidence of extensive damage was contained in a June 26
    Zeneca email, written immediately after seven growers reported damage to
    Zeneca and Zeneca’s representative attended at their farms.  The email described
    the damage to the Horodynsky crop as “overall poor, very bad spots”, the
    Dyriw crop as “a fair amount of damage” and the Smith crop as losing eighty
    acres.  The email reported that “the book will remain open” because “the

    to the onion crop was extensive in some fields.  On the other hand, some
    growers who used Dyfonate found it to be effective in 1995.  </p>

    would be visible within a very few days.  In my view, it is implicit in the
    trial judge’s acceptance of the Grafius opinion and the Committee report
    that extensive damage did not appear until later in June 1995.  That finding
    was open to him on the evidence and I am not persuaded that he misapprehended
    the evidence or made any reviewable error in accepting that the expert evidence
    was not compromised by the appellants’ evidence about crop damage visibility. </p>

    that the Committee specifically compared the 1995 temperatures to 1992 temperatures;
    1992 was a particularly cold spring. As well, the 1995 onion crop suffered
    significant smut damage, which was consistent with cooler temperatures that
    season.  Finally, the July 12, 1995 Weekly Horticultural Report, published

    involved in examining some of the crop damage when it was reported, she relied
    on damage assessments provided by pest management scouts.  Moreover, the

    she did not recall the Committee considering a 1994 test that showed, in
    a single plot, Dyfonate had a dissipation rate of twenty to one parts per
    million in sixty days.  While she said that information would have raised
    questions and changed the Committee’s memo, she did not say that it would
    have affected its conclusions.  Her testimony was clear that she understood
    the implication of dissipation rates on onion maggot control; that dissipation
    rates could vary from field to field and from year to year; that Dyfonate
    could not have dissipated at an unusually fast rate in 1995 in the test plots
    at the Research Station because it was effective; that Dyfonate had succeeded
    in protecting onions from maggots in 1993 and 1994; and in any event, there
    was no evidence to establish that Dyfonate lost its effectiveness even when
    it dissipated to low levels.  </p>

    rates.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    regarding the Dyfonate-Lorsban effectiveness comparison in both brochures,
    the impugned charts illustrate the percentage of damage for both insecticides
    as measured by the Research Station and in Bradford Co-Operative Field Trials
    (grower trials), both of which were conducted independently of Zeneca.  The
    charts could not be seen as a performance-based warranty, but only as making
    a representation about Dyfonate’s past performance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    test results showed Dyfonate to be effective in each of 1991, 1992 and 1993.  All
    these results were substantiated at trial, except for the Dyfonate results
    for the 1992 grower trials.  The documentation for those trials simply could
    not be found.  However, the trial evidence established that the 1992 results
    were available in 1994.  Moreover, the author of the brochure testified that
    he incorporated those results accurately in the brochure.  Since the appellants
    were unsuccessful in challenging this evidence, - and called no evidence
    to show that any of the test results were flawed in any manner - I do not
    see these charts as misrepresenting Dyfonate’s effectiveness in the past
    nor as purporting to represent Dyfonate’s effectiveness in the future nor
    as amounting to warranties of performance.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellants argue that the underlying data in the brochures was unreliable
    because, in 1993, Lorsban was tested in fifty sites, while Dyfonate was only
    tested in three, a fact not set out in the brochure.  However, the evidence
    established that the number of Dyfonate test sites was necessarily small
    because the growers were not prepared to risk testing a new product widely
    until its reliability had been established.  In contrast, since growers already
    used Lorsban widely, Lorsban tests could be conducted on more sites.  Again,
    the appellants provided no expert opinion that the small number of Dyfonate
    sites compromised the results in any way and the only expert evidence accepted
    at trial was to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the appellants submit that the 1993 brochure represented Dyfonate to be more
    effective than Lorsban, even when Lorsban was applied at the higher rate.  This
    submission is founded on that part of the 1993 brochure representing Dyfonate’s
    price to be about half that of Lorsban, based on prices provided by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bradford.  Unbeknownst to the respondents, however,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Bradford calculated the Lorsban price based on an application rate well in
    excess of the recommended label rate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, while the cost comparison was in error, it could not be taken as
    a warranty or representation that Dyfonate was as effective as Lorsban applied
    at the higher rate, at least without more.  I say this for two reasons.  First,
    the relevant paragraph in the brochure is only about pricing; it makes no
    reference to the quantities of insecticide to be applied.  Second, the brochure
    explicitly says the pricing came from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bradford so that the reader would have understood this information to be
    only about pricing and not about effectiveness.  In any event, the appellants’ complaint
    in this action is not about Dyfonate’s pricing, but about its effectiveness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    the 1994 brochure contained the rates at which the different active ingredients
    of Dyfonate and Lorsban persisted in the soil.  These persistence rates,
    which were taken from a 1984 published article of Dr. Kuhlman, an entomologist,
    were not successfully challenged at trial.  While the 1984 article was ten
    years old by the time of the brochure, and while the article relied on findings
    from as early as 1971, there was no evidence to show that the test results
    were faulty or that any subsequent test should, or would, have shown different
    persistence rates.  Moreover, the persistence rates quoted in the brochure
    would have been understood by the sophisticated commercial growers to reflect
    persistence rates in normal environmental conditions.  Indeed, the 1994 brochure
    set out the factors that would affect Dyfonate’s effectiveness, including
    soil moisture, soil type, soil Ph and soil temperature. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    while the 1994 brochure also stated that an “ideal” insecticide would give
    effective control from mid-April to mid-June
    “when onion maggot egg hatch of the first generation is almost complete”;  it
    did not represent that Dyfonate would be effective for sixty days, that it
    was the “ideal” pesticide, or that it would persist to prevent all maggot
    egg hatching.  It only represented that it had long soil persistence rates
    in normal conditions as substantiated by the Kuhlman article.  Even Mr. Horodynsky
    testified that he did not expect sixty days control, but that “we’d like
    it to work for 30 or 40 days.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, there was no evidence about the amount of active ingredient in
    the soil necessary to control onion maggots.  Indeed, the only evidence was
    that any such testing would not be reliable due to the variable conditions
    in the many different environments.  While the Committee recognized there
    were clearly insufficient quantities of fonofos in the soil by mid-to-late
    June of 1995, this retrospective information does not mean that Zeneca could
    or should have anticipated this result.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    accepting for the moment, the appellants’ expectation that Dyfonate would
    control onion maggots for the first generation, and accepting for the sake
    of that argument that the first generation endures for forty-five to sixty
    days, neither Zeneca nor Bradford provided any express guarantee or representation
    that Dyfonate would succeed in meeting these expectations irrespective of
    unusual climate conditions or other such variables.  Indeed, the evidence
    established that the appellants, who were knowledgeable and informed growers,
    knew about the inherent challenges of maggot control and that results could
    vary considerably from year to year and from field to field, depending upon
    a number of factors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    in the 1994 Muck Crop News, which recommended Dyfonate, OMAF specifically
    cautioned about the many factors that affect effectiveness and advised growers
    to weigh the merits of each product from a number of viewpoints before exercising
    their judgment.  Moreover, the appellants had all used Dyfonate in 1994,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a> in at least some of their fields, with favourable
    results.  While this indicated Dyfonate’s reliability, it did not amount
    to a representation or guarantee of similar results in the future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the appellants knew that insecticides dissipate in the soil at variable rates
    depending on the circumstances.  The one test that indicated Dyfonate dissipated
    at a concerning rate was acknowledged by the experts to be scientifically
    insignificant.  There was no evidence or opinion that the dissipation rates
    given in the brochure were inaccurate or misleading.  The only warranty provided
    was that Dyfonate contained ten percent of its active ingredient, and the
    evidence established that the product sold to the appellants met and exceeded
    that standard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I would conclude that Zeneca and Bradford gave no express performance-based
    warranties or representation regarding Dyfonate. </p>

'>Apart from the brochures, the appellants rely on an implied warranty under

      this court endorsed the view of Lord Diplock in <i>Ashington Piggeries

      it was stated that the key to s. 15(1) is “reasonable reliance of the buyer

    an obligation to warn the appellants that Dyfonate was “dangerous” or that
    it would not work in colder weather conditions or that it would not perform
    in accordance with the express warranties or representations discussed above.  For
    the reasons I have given regarding warranties and representations, the appellants
    have failed to establish any negligence on the part of the respondents in
    this respect.  More particularly, the appellants failed to establish on the
