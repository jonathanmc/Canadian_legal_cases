    appellant was convicted of robbery, possession of stolen property, fail to
    stop for the police, possession of a prohibited weapon, point firearm, and
    possession of a firearm arising from the armed robbery of Annis Jewellers
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Scarborough on February 12, 2002. The appellant, one of three people involved
    in the robbery, was the driver of the get away car and did not enter the
    jewellery store. She was tried with Stuart Brown and found guilty on all
    counts. The main proponent, Collin Burke, pled guilty and admitted robbing
    the jewellery store with the firearm. The appellant appeals her conviction
    on all counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant conceded that she drove Stuart Brown and Collin Burke
    to the jewellery store in her car and picked them up afterwards. There was
    no dispute that the front licence plates had been taken off her car and the
    back plate replaced by a yellow dealer plate. The appellant’s story was that
    she did not know the two people she was driving were going to commit robbery.
    This was arguably inconsistent with the fact that she did not pull her car
    over when followed by police but instead engaged them on a 1.3 km high speed
    chase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s central argument on this appeal is that the trial judge erred
    by admitting hearsay evidence provided by Mrs. Annis, the proprietor of the
    jewellery store. Mrs. Annis had testified at Burke’s sentencing hearing and
    identified the appellant as being in her store the day before the robbery.
    Mrs. Annis died before the appellant’s trial. She did not testify at the
    appellant’s preliminary hearing even though she was present at court that
    day. One of the reasons she was not called as a witness was because she was
    feeling ill. That information was not communicated by the Crown to defence
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    following the robbery, the police took statements from both Mr. and Mrs.
    Annis. Later that day Mrs. Annis went to the hospital for head injuries she
    suffered during the robbery. As a result of these injuries as well as a pre-existing
    heart condition that appeared to have been aggravated by the trauma of the
    robbery, Mrs. Annis remained in hospital for two weeks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Stewart testified that approximately five and a half weeks after the robbery,
    on March 22, 2002, Mrs. Annis spoke to him for the first time since the robbery.
    He visited Mrs. Annis at her home to return the jewellery taken during the
    robbery. According to Detective Stewart, during their meeting Mrs. Annis
    told him that she remembered a black female being in the store the day before
    the robbery and she thought it was odd. Mrs. Annis told him that the woman
    had come in and had looked at a diamond and asked if she could pay for it
    over time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    days later Detective Stewart returned to the store to show Mrs. Annis a photo
    line-up. According to Detective Stewart, Mrs. Annis identified the appellant
    as the person who was in her store. She commented that the woman was beautiful
    and had her hair tied back when she came into the store, not as shown in
    the photograph.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, Mrs. Annis was not called at the preliminary inquiry. She died
    around December 25, 2002. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown sought to introduce the evidence given by Mrs. Annis at
    Burke’s sentencing hearing. The portion of her testimony relating to the
    appellant is reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the llth of the month, at 5:30, she came into the store, the beautiful girl
    looked for diamonds. I showed her diamonds …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    there was a beautiful girl who came into the store looking for diamonds?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.
    She tried the diamond. She liked it and she asked me: Do you take payments?
    I said: “Yes, give me a little money and I’ll keep it for you”. She told
    me: “I don’t have now but I’ll come tomorrow or the day after and I’ll give
    some money down to get it”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Okay.
    Now I understand that you didn’t see this woman the day of the robbery?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
    no. The police showed me pictures in the book. And I saw that girl, and I
    put my hand there. I pointed … And I learned that this girl was driving the
    two others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge held that the Crown could read
    Mrs.&nbsp;Annis’
    testimony at the sentencing hearing of Collin Burke on September 24, 2002
    into the trial record in this case. The trial judge ruled the evidence admissible.
    He stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mrs. Annis said
    that the day before the robbery a beautiful girl came into the store looking
    for a diamond. That description was obviously generic, but nonetheless accurate.
    According to Mrs. Annis the girl tried on a diamond, liked it, and discussed
    putting down a down-payment. The girl then left, promising to return in a
    day or two to make a deposit. In her examination Mrs. Annis was not asked
    how long it took but obviously it was not a matter of seconds. Mrs. Annis
    made no pretense of ever seeing that person the day of the robbery. She later
    picked Yasmin Mohammed’s picture out of a photo line-up as the girl who had
    visited her store the day before the robbery.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mrs. Annis gave
    her testimony on the 24th of September 2002, shortly before the preliminary
    inquiry which began on October 8th. In order to admit her testimony, I must
    be satisfied that it meets the tests of necessity and reliability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mrs. Annis is
    dead and there is no other source for her evidence. She was not called to
    testify at the preliminary inquiry because the Crown felt that her health
    was frail.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I shall consider
    some of the factors to be considered in reaching a decision. No one factor
    is <i>sine qua non</i> of admissibility, nor must all factors be present.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(1)  the evidence was given under oath in a court of law before a judge
    with the solemnity of court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(2)    The testimony was recorded by an official court reporter, thus
    ensuring as much as humanly possible its accuracy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(3)    Mrs. Annis had no reason to lie. Her attacker had hit her at least
    once, but he had pled guilty; there was no need to exaggerate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(4)    As to likelihood of accuracy, Mrs. Annis’ evidence was neither
    complex nor lengthy, she told a simple story fairly simply.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(5)    This is not the evidence of someone who has caught just a fleeting
    glimpse of someone in passing. Mrs. Annis spent a not inconsequential amount
    of time with the woman close up enough to discuss the diamond ring and a
    possible down-payment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(6)    The sentence hearing of Burke was not an occasion on which defence
    counsel for the present accused could cross-examine Mrs. Annis. Crown counsel
    admitted that the cross-examination of Mrs. Annis by Burke’s counsel was
    no substitute for cross-examination by present counsel for Yasmin Mohammed
    and Stuart Brown.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Lack of opportunity to cross-exmaine is important but not definitive.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Balancing all these considerations, I hold that Mrs. Maria Annis’ testimony
    may be admitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Annis’ statement was read in as part of the Crown’s case. After Mrs. Annis’ evidence
    was read in, the judge stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Ladies and Gentleman,
    what I usually do after evidence tendered by the Crown, I turn to Ms. Von
    Achten and ask if she will cross-examine … but there is nobody for them to
    cross-examine. Maria Annis is dead, and that is why there is no further cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Stewart testified about this identification and was extensively cross-examined
    on all aspects of it, including the procedures pertinent to the integrity
    of Mrs.&nbsp;Annis’ identification</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      primary issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting Ms.&nbsp;Annis’
    testimony from the Burke sentencing hearing as original evidence. In particular,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in holding that it passed
    the requisite tests of necessity and reliability. Secondarily, the appellant
    submits that if the impugned evidence was admissible, the trial judge erred
    in failing to properly instruct the jury on its frailties as untested identification
    evidence.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Issue
      One: Admissibility of Mrs. Annis’ Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that Mrs. Annis’
    testimony was necessary. She submits that the Crown should have taken steps
    to preserve Mrs. Annis’ evidence, knowing that she had a pre-existing heart
    condition and had been affected by the robbery. We disagree. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mrs.
      Annis was only age 65 at the time of her death. While the Crown knew that
      she was infirm, there was no reason to anticipate that she would die before
      the trial. As such, this case does not come within the type of situation
      contemplated by Charron J. in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C.
      (3d) 161 at para. 104.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the issue of reliability, we see no error in the trial judge’s analysis.
      Importantly, in addition to the reasons given by the trial judge, at the
      time of the photo line-up there was no evidence (apart from speculation)
      that Mrs. Annis’ ability to identify the appellant had been tainted by
      external sources such as media coverage. Indeed, the evidence on this subject
      was to the contrary. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      for possible tainting by Detective Stewart, as noted, the Detective was
      extensively cross-examined about the circumstances surrounding the line-up
      procedure and no evidence of impropriety was revealed. That went some way
      to alleviating the concern about the inability to cross-examine Mrs. Annis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Absent
      tainting, apart from sheer good luck, Mrs. Annis’ ability to select the
      appellant as the person who was in her store on the evening before the
      robbery was powerful evidence. It strongly supported the reliability of
      her identification.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore,
      we note Detective Stewart’s evidence that Mrs. Annis was able to recognize
      the appellant’s face even though she told him “that her hair was not hanging
      down”
    as it appeared in the photograph. Mrs. Annis’ ability to recognize the appellant
    despite the change in her hairstyle adds further weight to the fifth factor
    mentioned by the trial judge, that Mrs. Annis had ample opportunity and ability
    to observe the woman in her store on the evening before the robbery</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      all of the relevant factors are taken into account, we are satisfied that
      the trial judge did not err in holding that the requisite test for reliability
      had been satisfied. It follows that Mrs. Annis’ evidence was properly received.
      Accordingly, the appellant’s first submission fails. </span></p>

      trial judge warned the jury that there was no effective cross-examination
      of Mrs. Annis and that this was a factor they should take into account
      in assessing her evidence. Furthermore, as noted, when her evidence was
      received, the trial judge told the jury that normally, Mrs. Annis would
      have been cross-examined but that this could not occur because she was
      deceased. </span></p>
