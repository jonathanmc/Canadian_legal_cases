    3000’s aircraft were leased.  The respondents in this appeal (collectively,
    the Authorities) applied under various statutes for court orders authorizing
    the seizure and detention of the aircraft on account of unpaid airport or
    air navigation charges.  These applications were vigorously opposed by the
    aircraft lessors, including the appellants, who claimed the right to repossess
    the leased aircraft based on legal title or perfected security interests
    in the aircraft. </p>

    parties then entered into negotiations concerning the terms on which the
    aircraft might be released to the lessors pending the determination of the
    Authorities’ seizure and detention applications.  By order dated December
    3, 2001, Ground J. of the Superior Court of Justice approved three protocols
    settled by the parties (the Release Order), which provided for the interim
    release of the aircraft to the lessors on condition that they post security
    for 110 per cent of the charges owing to the Authorities (the Release Fund).  When
    the Release Fund was in place, the aircraft were returned to the lessors.</p>

    the Aircraft claimed by such Lessor and declaring that the Airport Authorities’ right
    of seizure pursuant to such order has priority over and is enforceable against
    the right, title, interest and claims of such Lessor in and to such Aircraft

    the Authorities’ seizure and detention applications were dismissed by Ground
    J. on the basis that the statutory detention remedy sought by them did not
    take precedence over the rights of the lessors to terminate the leases and
    repossess the aircraft: <i>Re Canada 3000 Inc.</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 1775
    (S.C.J.).  This decision was subsequently upheld by a majority of this court,
    Juriansz J. (as he then was), sitting <i>ad hoc</i>, dissenting in part:
    (2004), 69 O.R. (3d) 1.</p>

    further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, these decisions were reversed
    in part: [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865 (the Supreme Court Decision).  The Supreme Court
    agreed with the applications judge and this court that the lessors were not
    liable for the unpaid charges owed to the Authorities.  However, the Supreme
    Court also held that the Authorities were entitled to obtain judicially-authorized
    seize and detain orders “to be exercised against the security posted in substitution
    for the aircraft”.  This statutory detention remedy, if granted by the courts,
    was limited to possession.  It did not confer any interest in the beneficial
    ownership of the aircraft, nor was it tantamount to the “airborne equivalent
    of a maritime lien”.  Moreover, it did not encompass any power to sell the
    aircraft once detained.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    the Supreme Court Decision, the applications judge granted seizure and detention
    orders in favour of the Authorities.  These orders, dated November 21 and
    29, 2006 as confirmed on January 12, 2007, authorized the Authorities to
    draw on the Release Fund in satisfaction of the debts owed to them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants, however, moved before Ground J. for various relief, including
    declarations: (i) that the Authorities had not satisfied the preconditions
    under the protocols in order to call or realize on the Release Fund; (ii)
    that the Authorities were not entitled to call or realize on the Release
    Fund in payment of any charges owed or owing to them; and (iii) that, except
    for “the right of detention until further order of the court”, the Authorities
    had no right or interest in the Release Fund.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ motion was not supported by the other aircraft lessors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    order dated January 12, 2007, the motion judge dismissed the appellants’ motion
    for declaratory relief, holding that the Authorities were entitled to collect
    the unpaid charges owed to them from the Release Fund.  Subsequently, by
    order dated March 9, 2007, he awarded the costs of the motion to the Authorities.  The
    appellants now appeal these orders.  They also appeal the November 2006 seizure
    and detention orders.  </p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants contend that the motion judge erred in his interpretation of both
    the judicially-approved protocols and the Supreme Court Decision.  In particular,
    contrary to the motion judge’s decision, the appellants maintain that the
    Authorities have not satisfied the call provisions under the protocols, with
    the result that resort by them to the Release Fund for payment of the debts
    owed to them is precluded.  The appellants further assert that because the
    Supreme Court Decision confines the nature and scope of the Authorities’ seizure
    and detention rights to the limited right to detain the aircraft, if so ordered
    by the courts, the Authorities’ detention remedy does not extend to a right
    to call on the money comprising the Release Fund to satisfy the unpaid charges
    owed to the Authorities.</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, this appeal turns on the proper interpretation of the purpose
    of the Release Order and associated protocols and the meaning of the call
    provisions contained in the protocols, construed in the context of the Supreme
    Court’s determination of the rights of the parties.  My consideration of
    these factors compels the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed.  I
    say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    by negotiating and settling the terms of the protocols, and thereafter obtaining
    the Release Order that incorporated the protocols, the parties effected a
    voluntary compromise of their rights and interests in respect of the aircraft,
    in exchange for mutual commercial benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    purpose of the protocols and the Release Order was to facilitate the interim
    return of the aircraft to the lessors –
    including the appellants – pending the adjudication of the Authorities’ seizure
    and detention applications, on terms designed to permit the continued use
    of the aircraft by the lessors while also protecting the rights of the Authorities
    in respect of the aircraft if they were eventually found to be entitled to
    exercise their statutory detention remedy.  This is confirmed by the following
    provisions of the protocols:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>9.         In advance of the hearing, the Lessors
    wish to obtain the release of the Aircraft by posting bonds or other security
    with the … Authorities in substitution for the Aircraft subject to the seizure
    claims, if any, which the … Authorities have against the Aircraft.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>B.        Purpose and Goals</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>10.       The purpose of this Release Protocol is
    to provide for the release of the Aircraft to the Lessors prior to the final
    determination of the Seizure Motions and to provide alternative security
    for the charges claimed by the … Authorities to be owing to them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    accomplish these goals, the protocols provided at para. 14 that the security
    posted in respect of an aircraft “shall stand in lieu of and in place of
    that Aircraft”.  Thus, the Release Fund was substituted for the security
    potentially afforded to the Authorities by the aircraft themselves
    – assets valued at approximately U.S. $1.1 billion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the compromise reflected in the protocols, the lessors gained the return
    of their aircraft – prior to any determination of their claimed right to
    terminate the leases in question and to regain possession of the aircraft – and
    the right to operate those aircraft, with attendant revenue generation, for
    their own account.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    economic value to the lessors of these benefits should not be minimized.  The
    motion judge put it this way when, at para. 14 of his reasons, he adopted
    the following submission made by the Authorities:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   The [appellants] obtained a significant commercial
    benefit under the Release Protocols; they received the right, but not the
    obligation, to get their aircraft back in service and generating revenue.  In
    return, they were required to post a fraction of the value of their aircraft
    as surety and bond.  In fact, the Release Protocol Order as a whole enabled
    the release of Aircraft worth approximately U.S. $1.1 billion in exchange
    for sureties of approximately 3% of that amount.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;'>I agree with this description of
    the effect of the protocols and the Release Order on the position of the
    lessors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conversely,
    the Authorities surrendered a powerful commercial advantage under the protocols.  So
    long as the Authorities retained their seizure and detention rights regarding
    the aircraft, they were positioned to
    ‘tie-up’ the aircraft, thus preventing their use by the lessors indefinitely,
    until arrangements satisfactory to the Authorities were made for payment
    of the charges owed to them.  The relinquishment of these rights by the Authorities
    was a significant compromise of their bargaining position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the Authorities also obtained an important advantage under the ‘deal’ made
    by the parties.  The benefit to the Authorities of the surrender of the negotiation
    leverage that arose from their ability to detain the aircraft indefinitely
    was security of future payment of the amounts owed to them from the funds
    posted as security in lieu of the aircraft.  In effect, the Authorities “traded” the
    leverage arising from their seizure and detention rights in favour of security
    of future payment, on the contingency that they would ultimately prevail
    on the determination of their seizure and detention applications.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    commercial implications of the protocols for the Authorities were not lost
    on the motion judge.  In his reasons in support of the Release Order, he
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The subject aircraft obviously have an aggregate
    value far in excess of the total fees in respect of which the [A]uthorities
    claim detention rights and <i>the release of the aircraft will result in
    the [A]uthorities losing their only potential security for the fees owing</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    negotiated compromise achieved under the protocols also advanced the public
    interest.  As the motion judge stated in his reasons in support of the Release
    Order:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is accordingly essential that pending such final
    disposition [of the seizure and detention applications], some procedure be
    put in place quickly whereby the aircraft can be released to the lessors
    and put back into service for the benefit not only of the lessors but also
    for the benefit of the airline and travel industries and the traveling public.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Relying
    on para. 16(i) of the protocols, however, the appellants contend that the
    negotiated bargain between the parties does not permit resort to the Release
    Fund by the Authorities absent a prior judicial determination that the Authorities’ seizure
    and detention rights afforded them a “priority” interest over the aircraft
    ahead of that of the lessors.  To hold otherwise, the appellants submit,
    would allow the Authorities to “expropriate” the lessors’
    money – the Release Fund – to retire the debts owed to the Authorities by
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    3000 when, as confirmed by the Supreme Court Decision, the lessors have no
    responsibility in law for those debts.  I would reject this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    16(i) of the protocols establishes two preconditions to the Authorities’ right
    to call on the Release Fund to satisfy the outstanding charges owed to them.  First,
    the Authorities are obliged to obtain a final court order, from which all
    appeal rights have been spent, lifting any applicable stay of proceedings
    and granting the Authorities seizure orders against the aircraft claimed
    by the lessors.  As I have indicated, these orders were made by the motion
    judge in November 2006 and confirmed on January 12, 2007.  Accordingly, once
    all appeal rights from these orders have been exhausted – including this
    appeal – this precondition will have been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    para. 16(i) of the protocols requires that a final court order be in place,
    declaring that the Authorities’ right of seizure “has priority over and is
    enforceable against the right, title, interest and claims of [the lessor
    in question] in and to such Aircraft”.  In their factum filed on this appeal,
    the appellants argued that this requirement obliges the Authorities to establish
    that a detention order in their favour “creates a secured lien so that [the
    Authorities] had superior title to the [Release Fund] to the extent of their
    unpaid debt than would the [lessor] as [the] mere owner [of the aircraft
    in question]”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In my view, this argument ignores the heart of the bargain struck
    by the parties under the protocols.  As I have said, from the perspective
    of the Authorities, the essence of the protocols was a trade of the negotiating
    leverage arising from their seizure and detention rights in exchange for
    security of future payment of the debts owed to them.  This did not depend
    on a holding that the Authorities’ detention remedy was the equivalent in
    law of a secured lien.  Rather, it arose from the negotiations between the
    parties and from the resulting agreement embodied in the protocols and the
    Release Order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the interpretation of para. 16(i) urged by the appellants is inconsistent
    with the language and context of the protocols.  The motion judge was of
    the view that the appellants’ interpretation of para. 16(i) would require
    a court order declaring that the Authorities’ detention rights have priority
    over the title of the aircraft lessors “in the sense of priority of one creditor’s
    claim over that of another creditor to an asset of the debtor”.  The motion
    judge, who drafted the protocols and oversaw the proceedings that led to
    the Release Order, rejected this interpretation, holding at para. 11 of his
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not agree that the word “priority” was used
    in that sense in the Release Protocols.  The whole purpose of the Release
    Protocols was to provide a mechanism whereby the aircraft could be released
    into service and the Authorities granted some security for the unpaid Charges
    pending a determination of the conflicting rights of the Authorities to detain
    the aircraft and the Lessors to possess the aircraft.  <i>It was not a question
    of competing security interests of two creditors in the same asset of the
    debtor</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  At the time of the Release Order, the Authorities had sought, but
    had not yet obtained, seizure and detention orders.  Their entitlement to
    such orders remained to be determined by the courts.  Consequently, the accord
    struck under the protocols was not in the nature of a “bond-off” of a seizure
    order.  Rather, from the Authorities’
    perspective, the core of the protocols was the creation of a right to call
    on the Release Fund in the future, contingent upon the Authorities’ success
    on their detention app-lications.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was not a typical priorities contest between competing creditors.  It was
    a deal struck between the titleholders to the aircraft and the unpaid creditors
    of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    3000 for reasons particular to their respective interests.  Were it otherwise,
    it is difficult to conceive that the Authorities voluntarily would have surrendered
    the bargaining power arising from their prospective indefinite detention
    of aircraft valued at about U.S. $1.1 billion for the uncertain benefit of
    possession – but not the use – of money posted in substitution for the aircraft.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the Supreme Court Decision, the court held that the Authorities were entitled
    to seize and detain the aircraft notwithstanding the lessors’ property rights
    in the aircraft.  In effect, therefore, the Supreme Court Decision provides
    the legal basis for a declaration concerning priority and enforceability,
    in satisfaction of the second precondition contem-plated by para. 16(i) of
    the protocols.  As observed by the Supreme Court at para. 76 of the Supreme
    Court Decision: “In the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario case, there was considerable debate about whether the detention remedy
    created a lien. … Whether or not a lien could be said to arise by operation
    of law is perhaps of theoretical interest but it has no practical bearing
    on the result in these appeals.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I do not accept the appellants’
    submission that the seizure and detention order issued by the motion judge
    in respect of the appellants “directly contradicts the instructions given
    by the Supreme Court as to the permissible scope of that order”, by permitting
    the Authorities recourse against the Release Fund.  To the contrary, in my
    opinion, the decision of the motion judge is entirely consistent with the
    Supreme Court Decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Binnie, writing for the Supreme Court, stated at paras. 8-10 of the Supreme
    Court Decision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   I agree with the courts below that the respondent
    legal titleholders are not subject to personal or corporate liability to
    pay the unpaid charges under s. 55 <i>CANSCA</i>.  But that is not to say
    that the aircraft are similarly unburdened.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   In my view, the appellants are entitled to obtain
    judicially-authorized seize and detain orders (hereinafter sometimes collectively
    referred to as the detention remedy) to be exercised against the security
    posted in substitution for the aircraft.  The matters should be remitted
    to the motions judges to work out the details of the orders.  Considered
    in the context in which the detention remedy was intended by Parliament to
    operate, the detention remedy cannot be circumvented as suggested by the
    respondents by the expedient of leasing arrangements made between the airlines
    and the aircraft lessors.  The detention remedy is purely statutory and Parliament’s
    intention to create an effective collection mechanism against <i>the aircraft</i> itself
    owned or operated by the person liable to pay the amount or charge must be
    given full effect. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   On the other hand, the appellants’ remedy, if
    an order is granted, is limited to possession.  Simple possession under the
    statutes does not confer any interest in the beneficial ownership of the
    aircraft.  I do not think the appellants’ further claim to the airborne equivalent
    of a maritime lien is well founded, nor do they have any “implied” power
    to sell the aircraft once detained.  They get what the statute says they
    get – a right to apply for a judicial order to seize and detain the aircraft
    until payment – no more, and no less.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I read these key passages, the Supreme Court held that the Authorities’ statutory
    detention remedy, if granted by the courts, as occurred here, takes priority
    over the rights of the lessors to repossess the aircraft, but the Authorities
    could not look to the aircraft itself to obtain payment of the outstanding
    charges owed to them.  As Binnie J. put it, “[T]he appellants’
    remedy, if an order is granted, is limited to possession.  Simple possession
    under the statutes does not confer any interest in the beneficial ownership
    of the aircraft.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the same time, however, as set out above, the Supreme Court accepted that
    the detention remedy – if granted – can be
    “exercised against the security posted in sub-stitution for the aircraft”,
    in accordance with Parliament’s intention “to create an effective collection
    mechanism against the aircraft itself”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    the detention remedy afforded the Authorities under the applicable federal
    statutes contemplates the ultimate payment of the debts owed to the Authorities
    was recognized throughout the Supreme Court Decision.  Justice Binnie observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>83.       The only claim that the [A]uthorities
    have under federal aeronautics law is the claim to possession of the aircraft <u>until
    their user charges are paid</u>.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>86.       [T]he statute says that an aircraft operated
    by the person liable to pay the amount can be seized and, absent further
    court order, need not be released until the entire amount owed by that <i>operator</i> <u>has
    been paid. … The [A]uthorities must only release the aircraft if “the amount
    in respect of which the seizure was made is paid</u>”.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>92.       Parliament has left the door open for
    the motions judge to work out an arrangement that is fair and reasonable
    to all concerned, <u>provided that the object and purpose of the remedy (to
    ensure the unpaid user fees are paid) is fulfilled</u>. … The judge need
    not make each aircraft hostage for the full amount of the unpaid charges, <u>provided
    the result is that the authority is paid in full</u>.  [Italicized emphasis
    in original; underlined emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    practical terms, the Authorities’ detention remedy is a statutory device
    intended to drive all interested parties to the bargaining table to negotiate
    the payment of the debts owed to the Authorities, against the prospect of
    the release of the detained aircraft.  Justice Binnie described this “collection
    mechanism” in these terms at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is more likely that Parliament fully appreciated
    that in dealing with aircraft flown in and out of jurisdictions under complex
    leasing arrangements, the only effective collection scheme is to render the
    aircraft themselves available for seizure, and thereafter to let those interested
    in them, including legal titleholders, registered owners, sublessors and
    operators, to resolve their dispute about where the money is to come from
    to pay the debts due to the service providers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    while the scope of the detention remedy, once engaged, is limited to the
    right to detain the aircraft, the <i>purpose</i> of the remedy is to promote
    payment of the debts owed to the Authorities through negotiated dispute resolution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the parties did “resolve their dispute about where the money is
    to come from to pay the debts due” to the Authorities.  Although not legally
    required to do so, they negotiated the creation of a Release Fund – in substitution
    for the aircraft and in consideration of the release of the aircraft to the
    lessors.  Having so elected, the Authorities’ entitlement to detain the aircraft
    was in issue thereafter only to the extent that the judicial grant of their
    detention remedy was the trigger for the invocation of the call provisions
    under the protocols and the Release Order.  This occurred here when, in accordance
    with the Supreme Court Decision, the motion judge determined to grant the
    requested detention remedy.  Nothing more was required to satisfy the call
    provisions under the protocols.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in the end, the protocols facilitated Parliament’s intention in creating
    the detention remedy, by generating a negotiation process that produced a
    fund from which the Authorities might be paid in full.  In my opinion, this
    conforms with the Supreme Court’s conclusion that Parliament’s objective
    in respect of the remedy was to create an effective collection mechanism,
    enforceable against the aircraft, for the eventual payment in full of the
    unpaid charges owed to the Authorities. </p>
  <h2>IV.       Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude, therefore, that the protocols and the Release Order reflect a voluntary
    commercial arrangement entered into by highly sophisticated parties for their
    mutual benefit.  Under this arrangement, the appellants, like the other lessors,
    accepted that if the Authorities succeeded on their seizure and detention
    applications, recourse by the Authorities to the Release Fund would follow.  This
    was the risk knowingly undertaken by the lessors to achieve a pressing commercial
    objective at the time of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    3000’s demise – the immediate return of their aircraft.  I agree with the
    following submission by the Authorities, adopted by the motion judge at para.
    14 of his reasons: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Lessors posted this security [the Release Fund]
    without prejudice to their abilities to make legal and factual argu-ments
    on the issues that were litigated to the [Supreme Court of Canada].  The
    Lessors did not retain the right to argue that they could have full use of
    their Aircraft for five years, with no attendant payment obligation if they
    lost the legal arguments. </p>
