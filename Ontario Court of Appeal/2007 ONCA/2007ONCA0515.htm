    appellant, Oliver Haufe, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by Justice
    B.J. Frazer following the appellant’s guilty plea for robbery.  The sentence
    imposed was 18 months in custody (in addition to credit given for 48 days
    spent in pre-trial detention) followed by two years probation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    robbery occurred on December 29, 1995.  It was a home robbery in which two
    intruders were surprised by the returning home owner.  An altercation followed
    and the home owner was beaten, injured and taken to hospital.  A fingerprint
    left at the scene led to the arrest of the appellant more than ten years
    later on April 1, 2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s principal ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by rejecting
    the joint submission for sentence of counsel (namely, six months in custody)
    and imposing a sentence that tripled the proposed sentence (18 months).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge did warn defence counsel that he was considering the imposition
    of a sentence higher than the joint submission.  He also afforded defence
    counsel an opportunity to make further submissions after he issued his warning.  However,
    in our view, the sentencing judge did not comply with the legal principles
    that apply to the rejection of a joint submission relating to sentence.  In
    the leading case, <i>R. v. Cerasuolo</i> (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 at 447-8
    (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Finlayson J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This court has repeatedly held that trial judges
    should not reject joint submissions <u>unless the joint submission is contrary
    to the public interest and the sentence would bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute</u>: <i>e.g. R. v. Dorsey</i> (1999), 123 O.A.C. 342
    at 345.  <u>This is a high threshold and is intended to foster confidence
    in an accused, who has given up his right to a trial, that the joint submission
    he obtained in return for a plea of guilty will be respected by the sentencing
    judge</u>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown and the defence bar have cooperated in
    fostering an atmosphere where the parties are encouraged to discuss the issues
    in a criminal trial with a view to shortening the trial process.  This includes
    bringing issues to a final resolution through plea bargaining.  <u>This laudable
    initiative cannot succeed unless the accused has some assurance that the
    trial judge will in most instances honour agreements entered into by the
    Crown.</u>  While we cannot overemphasize that these agreements are not to
    fetter the independent evaluation of the sentences proposed, <u>there is
    no interference with the judicial independence of the sentencing judge in
    requiring him or her to explain in what way a particular joint submission
    is contrary to the public interest and would bring the adminis-tration of
    justice into disrepute</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, the sentencing judge’s reasons in this case do not meet the requirements
    of <i>Cerasuolo</i>.  The sentencing judge said nothing about the joint submission
    that counsel placed before him.  This was particularly regrettable given
    that the Crown position on sentence had been the subject of a litigation
    conference in the Crown office which led to a formal letter to defence counsel
    setting out the Crown position.  In these circumstances, the sentencing judge’s
    silence about the joint submission does not “explain in what way a particular
    joint submission is contrary to the public interest and would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in our view, it cannot be said that the sentence proposed in the joint submission
    (six months) was so clearly unreasonable as to make the imposition of an
    18 month more or less self-evident.  The sentencing judge himself identified
    several factors – the fact that the offence was committed in 1995, the guilty
    plea, and the appellant’s good conduct including employment, overcoming addiction,
    and non-commission of crimes in the two years before being sentenced for
    the 1995 robbery.  In our view, these factors called out for an explanation
    of why the sentencing judge rejected the joint submission and imposed a custodial
    sentence three times higher than the joint submission.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leave
    to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and a custodial sentence
    of six months is imposed.  The other components of the sentence (credit for
    pre-trial custody and probation) are affirmed.</p>
