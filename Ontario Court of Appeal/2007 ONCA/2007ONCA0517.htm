style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Tommy Waugh, appeals his
    conviction, by Hockin J. sitting with a jury, for robbery, wearing a disguise,
    and possession of property obtained by crime.  He also seeks leave to appeal his sentence of three years (two years
    plus one year credit for pre-trial custody).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 4, 2005, someone robbed Belinda
    Austin, an employee working at the Canadian Legion branch in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    London.  The key issue at the trial was the identity of the robber – was it the
    appellant or his friend, Darcy Woodruff.  At the preliminary inquiry, Woodruff testified that he committed the
    robbery.  However, he did not testify at
    the trial although he was subpoenaed and available to testify.  The appellant did not testify but his brother
    was called by the defence and testified that Woodruff was the robber.</p>
  <h2><u>Conviction Appeal</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge told the jury that it could
    infer from the defence failure to call Woodruff that his evidence would not
    have been helpful to the defence.  In
    oral argument, counsel for the appellant accepted that the trial judge could
    give that instruction in the circumstances of this case.  He argued, however, that the jury should have
    been told to proceed cautiously before drawing that inference.  The trial judge could have added this caution
    to his instruction.  However, it was not
    mandatory and the failure to give it does not amount to reversible
    non-direction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also submits that the jury should
    have been told that there may have been perfectly valid reasons for the defence
    not to call Woodruff.  We agree that it
    would have been better had the trial judge added this to his instruction.  However, we agree with the Crown’s submission
    that in the circumstances it would have been obvious to everyone that the
    defence did not call Woodruff because he would not have taken sole
    responsibility for the robbery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge erred by limiting defence counsel’s cross-examination of Officer Hicks
    with respect to the potential identification evidence of Eleanor McLaughlin.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  At the time he made his ruling, there was no foundation for any
    questions to any witness about Ms. McLaughlin.  As the trial judge said, the accused could have called her as a witness
    and, if she testified, “if it becomes important, the officer may return.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the appellant submits that the trial
    Crown engaged in misconduct during the trial in three respects – issuing a
    subpoena to a witness (Woodruff) he did not intend to call, commenting in his
    closing address on the defence’s failure to call Woodruff as a witness, and
    overstating the strength of the eyewitness evidence of Ms. Austin.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  The issuance of a subpoena to Woodruff was an obvious precautionary step
    relating to an obvious potential witness.  Furthermore, it can in no way be seen as a
    misuse of the subpoena power in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  We also observe that the
    defence also subpoenaed, but did not call, Woodruff.  The Crown comment about the failure to call
    Woodruff as a witness was a reasonable comment, especially in light of the
    defence position throughout the trial that Woodruff was the robber.  The Crown submission about Ms. Austin’s
    identification evidence did not overstep the bounds of proper advocacy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing to apply the principles from <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) to all of the
    exculpatory evidence led by the defence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  The trial judge may not have followed the precise formula used in <i>W.(D.)</i>.  However, his instruction achieved the same effect.  He carefully and fairly reviewed all of the
    defence evidence, including the appellant’s denial of any involvement in the
    robbery in his videotaped police interview, as well as the exculpatory
    evidence.  It is an overly technical
    reading of his jury charge to say that the <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction was divorced from the broad context of all the evidence in the
    case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge erred in allowing Crown counsel to lead hearsay information through
    Officer Hicks to the effect that Woodruff denied involvement in the
    robbery.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent concedes that Woodruff’s denial
    should not have been admitted for the purpose sought by the Crown.  The Crown sought to give context to the
    appellant’s response to the police when they advised him that Woodruff had
    denied involvement in the offence.  However, based on the evidence given by Officer Hicks, it does not
    appear that the appellant gave a response when advised by the police of
    Woodruff’s denial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, this one error in this case –
    relating to Officer Hicks’ testimony about Woodruff denying involvement in the
    robbery – did not occasion a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  No emphasis was placed on it after it was
    admitted – by anyone, including the defence.  Counsel did not ask for a limiting instruction, nor did she object to
    the jury charge on the basis of a limiting instruction.  The reality is that the admission of
    Woodruff’s denial through Officer Hicks’ testimony was largely eclipsed by the
    inference that could be drawn from the defence’s failure to call Woodruff at
    trial, which the trial judge properly instructed the jury was open to them. </p>
  <h2><u>Sentence Appeal</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant contends that the sentence imposed
    on him was too high for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge did not take sufficient account of his youth (nineteen when the offence
    was committed).  We disagree.  The trial judge referred to the appellant’s
    age as a mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the appellant contends that a three-year
    sentence was outside the appropriate range.  We disagree.  The robbery
    committed by the appellant was a serious one with a substantial negative impact
    on the victim.  We also observe that
    defence counsel’s position at trial was that a two-year sentence was
    appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge did not properly take account of the fact that he was of aboriginal
    heritage.  It is true that no one in this
    case – defence counsel, Crown counsel or the trial judge – did anything other
    than make a glancing reference to this important fact.  It is essential that all actors in the
    justice system address this factor in a careful and balanced way: see <i>R. v. Wells</i> (1998), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 368
    (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Kakekagamick</i> (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the latter decision
    admittedly being released after the sentence in this case was imposed.  Having said that, the trial judge’s brief
    reference to this factor – namely, that it did not apply to this serious and
    violent offence by a man with a significant record, including for other crimes
    of violence – was, in our view, a reasonable conclusion expressly recognized by
    the analyses in <i>Wells</i> and <i>Kakekagamick</i>.  In short, a sentence of three years in custody
    for this offender committing this offence was not an unfit sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do note that in preparation for this appeal,
    defence and Crown counsel co-operated in obtaining a report from the
    appellant’s parole officer to assist in dealing with the appellant’s aboriginal
    background.  That report provides positive
    information about the appellant’s progress in custody.  The report advises that the appellant is
    doing very well in the institution and he is participating in aboriginal
    cultural activities and ceremonies.  This
    information supports the conclusion that the sentence for this young man was an
    appropriate one.</p>
