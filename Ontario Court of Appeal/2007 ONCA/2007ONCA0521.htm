line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three issues on her appeal from an
    order finding that she wrongfully removed her child from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida
    and directing that she return the child to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida. In addition, the appellant seeks to
    introduce fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>Grounds of Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant submits that the application judge
    erred in admitting the evidence of Michael C. Berry on the issue of proof of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida law by failing
    to ensure that Mr. Berry was a properly qualified expert. Apart from indicating
    that Mr. Berry is a licensed attorney in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida,
    the affidavit of Mr.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Berry filed before the
    application judge includes no particulars of Mr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Berry’s experience or qualifications. The
    appellant contends that, in these circumstances, Mr.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Berry’s
    affidavit did not demonstrate that Mr. Berry had the necessary expertise to
    provide an opinion about the state of Florida family law and that the
    application judge erred by failing to exclude his evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The appellant did not file any expert
    evidence concerning
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida
    law on the application nor did she in any way challenge either Mr.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Berry’s qualifications or his evidence. While it no doubt
    would have been preferable for Mr. Berry to have appended a copy of his
    curriculum vitae to his affidavit and to have provided particulars of the
    nature of his practice, in the absence of any challenge to his expertise or his
    evidence, the fact of his status as an attorney licensed to practise in Florida
    was sufficient to justify the admission of his evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the application
    judge erred by failing to apply the proper standard of proof for proving
    foreign law. In essence, the appellant contends that the application judge
    erred by relying on bald statements by Mr.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Berry
    concerning the state of family law in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. As already noted,
    before the application judge the appellant did not contest either Mr.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Berry’s qualifications
    or his evidence. In these circumstances, it was open to the application judge to
    accept Mr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Berry’s
    evidence even in the absence of further elaboration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant submits that, in determining that
    the child was wrongfully removed from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida,
    the application judge erred by considering events that occurred subsequent to
    the date of removal. In particular, the appellant points out that as of the
    date of removal, the respondent had not acknowledged that he was the father of
    the child but rather was seeking paternity testing. Relying on a plain reading
    of s. 744.301 of the <i>Domestic Relations
    Act</i>, Fla. Stat. tit. XLIII, the appellant contends that the application
    judge could only have reached the conclusion that the respondent was a parent
    with custody rights by relying on the paternity tests that occurred after the
    date of removal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. The appellant did not
    raise any issue before the application judge that the respondent’s custody
    rights might be different depending on whether he was a “wondering” father as
    compared to a father so declared or so found. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence before the application judge confirmed
    that, as of the date of removal, the appellant asserted that the respondent was
    the father of the child and further, that although the respondent was seeking
    confirmation of that fact, he had had ongoing involvement with the child. The
    expert evidence was to the effect that, in the state of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida, an unmarried father of a child is
    entitled to equal custody rights, including the right to determine the child’s
    place of residence. As we read his reasons, it was this evidence that led the
    application judge to conclude that the respondent was a parent with custody
    rights as of the date of removal. In particular, we note that the excerpts from
    certain authorities quoted by the application judge in the analysis section of
    his reasons make it clear that the application judge was alive to the
    requirement to determine the issues of whether the removal was in breach of
    custody rights that existed and were being exercised as of the date of the
    removal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, although the application judge referred to
    the paternity testing that occurred after the date of removal in the facts
    section of his reasons, he did so for the purpose of completing the narrative
    and not for the purpose of determining the respondent’s status as a parent with
    custody rights as of the date of removal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>The Fresh Evidence
    Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant applies to file expert
    evidence in response to Mr.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Berry’s
    affidavit. The appellant submits that even when considered in the light of the
    further evidence the respondent seeks to file, at a minimum, the fresh evidence
    raises a triable issue concerning whether wondering fathers have custody rights
    under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida
    law. Depending on this court’s view of the totality of the new evidence, the
    appellant asks that the fresh evidence be admitted and that this court either
    make a finding that the respondent had no custody rights as of the date of
    removal or order a new hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We decline to admit the fresh evidence. We acknowledge
    that there are various conflicts in the expert evidence that has now been
    filed. However, a core assertion in the respondent’s evidence is that even if
    the appellant had presumptive rights to primary custody as of the date of
    removal because of the respondent’s status as a wondering father, the
    appellant’s entitlement did not leave the respondent without any custody rights
    under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida
    law as of the date of removal. On our review of the fresh evidence filed by
    both parties, the appellant’s evidence does not undermine this assertion. In
    the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the fresh evidence might
    reasonably have affected the application judge’s decision. It should not
    therefore be admitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although not determinative, we also conclude that the
    appellant has failed to meet the due diligence criterion for the admission of
    fresh evidence. Simply put, the appellant has not provided a reasonable
    explanation for the failure to file expert evidence on the application or to in
    any way contest the respondent’s expert evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs to the
    respondent on a partial indemnity scale fixed in the amount of $7500.00
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable G.S.T.</p>
