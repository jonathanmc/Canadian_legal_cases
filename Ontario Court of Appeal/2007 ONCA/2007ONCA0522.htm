style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>V.G. appeals his convictions on two grounds: first,
    the trial judge erred in ruling the proposed opinion evidence of a
    psychologist, Dr. Moore, inadmissible; and second, the trial judge erred in
    admitting the child’s out of court statement.</p>
  <h2>1)        Dr. Moore’s evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled that Dr. Moore’s proposed
    testimony did not meet the necessity criterion in <i>Mohan</i>.  V.G. contends that
    the trial judge misunderstood the purpose of Dr. Moore’s testimony.  He says that Dr. Moore was not going to give
    an opinion on the threshold reliability of the child’s evidence, but on the
    methodology for making that determination.  In our view, the trial judge’s reasons show that he understood the
    purpose of Dr. Moore’s testimony.  He did
    not err in concluding that Dr. Moore’s evidence was not outside the experience
    or knowledge of a trial judge and thus was unnecessary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s conclusion is entirely
    consistent with the reasons of Rosenberg J.A. in <i>R. v. C.T</i>., where this court also upheld a trial judge’s decision
    to hold Dr. Moore’s evidence inadmissible.  We therefore do not accept the appellant’s submission that the trial
    judge erred in refusing to admit Dr. Moore’s testimony.</p>
  <h2>2)        Admissibility of the out of
    court statement</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>V.G. submits that because of the numerous
    contradictions in the child’s evidence, the trial judge erred in holding that
    the test of threshold reliability had been met.  As part of this submission, V.G. argues that the trial judge did not
    determine whether the child knew the meaning of truth and falsehood.  We do not accept the appellant’s
    submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reading the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, we
    are satisfied that he was alert to the hearsay dangers present in this
    case.  His reasons also show that he was
    satisfied that these dangers were overcome by the following considerations: the
    appellant had an opportunity for full contemporaneous cross-examination at the
    preliminary inquiry; the videotape provided evidence of the child’s demeanour;
    and the trial judge himself was persuaded that there was sufficient evidence
    the child knew the difference between truth and falsehood, the nature of a
    promise and the need to tell the truth in court.  In the light of these considerations, we see
    no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the out-of-court statement met
    the test of threshold reliability.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly the conviction appeal is dismissed. </p>
