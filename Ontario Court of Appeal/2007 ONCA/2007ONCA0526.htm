    Southern District of Illinois, a search warrant was obtained by the Royal
    Canadian Mounted Police to search the appellants’ business premises and seize
    business records relating to an alleged fraudulent telemarketing scheme.  The search warrant was facially overbroad and
    when the search was executed, the seizure exceeded the terms of the warrant.  On the application to send the materials
    seized to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>

    the application judge found that despite the overbreadth of the warrant and the
    over-seizure in its execution, the Act gave him the discretion to send to the
    requesting state those materials that could properly have been seized under a
    valid warrant.  The appellants contend
    that the application judge erred and that he should have ordered that the
    seized materials be returned. </p>

  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the request of the U.S. Attorney for the
    Southern District of Illinois, approved by the Minister of Justice of Canada,
    an RCMP officer applied for and obtained a search warrant in relation to a U.S.
    investigation into a fraudulent telemarketing scheme allegedly operated by a
    number of entities, including those known as “Prime One” and “Veritech”, under
    the direction of the appellants.  The
    premises of Prime One were identified in the letter of request as being
    <st1:address
w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    60 St. Clair Avenue East,
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Prior to the issuance of the search warrant, but after the RCMP had
    determined that Prime One was no longer at 60 St. Clair, a subsequent letter
    from the U.S.Attorney “update[ing] our request for an MLAT search warrant
    previously approved by [the Minister]” asked for the search to be conducted at
    274 Eglinton Avenue West.  The RCMP
    officer swore that he had attended at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    60
    St. Clair Avenue and found that Prime One was not
    a tenant at that building.  He further
    swore that he had received information from Bell Security that Prime One’s
    telephone number had been redirected to another location, namely to 274
    Eglinton Avenue West.  His affidavit also
    contained certain observations he made upon visiting the Eglinton premises
    which tended to show that the appellants were using those premises.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the list of items contained in the
    affidavit was broad, the application judge found that it “provided a basis for
    the limitation of the search within reasonable bounds.”  <span class=MsoCommentReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>However, the</span></span> search warrant, granted <i>ex parte</i> by a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice, identified only general categories and did not restrict or
    limit the scope of the search to the timeframe or nature of the alleged fraud.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The search warrant was executed and
    approximately twenty bankers’ boxes of materials were seized from the premises
    at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    274 Eglinton Avenue West. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Proceedings before the Superior Court of Justice</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants initially brought applications to
    quash the search warrant and secure the return of the seized materials.  These applications were withdrawn when the
    respondent quite properly took the position that <i>certiorari </i>does not lie as against the order of a justice of the
    Superior Court. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The matter subsequently proceeded before the
    Superior Court on the respondent’s s. 15 application for an order to send the
    seized material to the requesting state.  Counsel for the respondent conceded that the search warrant was overbroad.  He also conceded that there had been an
    over-seizure in that some items seized were not identified in the warrant, although
    he took the position that most of this material was insignificant detritus, having
    no informational significance, collected because it was entwined with material
    that did fall within the terms of the warrant.  The respondent further conceded that all but
    one and one-half of the twenty boxes of seized documents should be returned to
    the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge found that despite the overbreadth
    of the warrant and the over-seizure arising from its execution, he had the
    discretion to make a sending order for the material for which a judge issuing a
    search warrant could properly conclude that warrant should issue.  His reasons for this decision were released
    on September 19, 2006, and reported at [2006] O.J. No. 3726 (“the September
    reasons”).  At the end of those reasons,
    the application judge directed counsel to review the one and one-half boxes to
    ensure that they were evidence of the offences in question.  Counsel for the appellants refused to
    participate in this review to preserve their position for appeal purposes.  A second hearing then took place and on
    November 24, 2006, the application judge released reasons, reported at [2006]
    O.J. No. 5507 (“the November reasons”), in which he reviewed the material, on
    an item-by-item basis, to determine what could properly be sent to the United
    States.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span

  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the application judge err by finding that
    the evidence filed in support of the warrant was sufficient to provide a

    at the Eglinton location?</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the application judge err by concluding that

  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the application judge err by concluding that
    he could make a sending order despite his finding that had this been a domestic
    search warrant it would have been quashed because it was overly broad? </p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Did the application judge err by reviewing each
    of the seized items seized under the overbroad warrant to determine which items
    could properly have been seized under a validly drawn warrant and making a
    sending order with respect to those items?</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(1) Did the
    application judge err by finding that the evidence filed in support of the
    warrant was sufficient to provide a reasonable conclusion that materials found
    by the search warrant would be found at the Eglinton location?<u></u></span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the affidavit evidence
    supporting the search at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    274
    Eglinton Avenue West was insufficient to support
    an inference that evidence of the alleged foreign offences would be found
    there.  Although this argument was not at
    the forefront of the appellants’ attack on the sending order, I deal with it
    first as it stands apart from the other three related issues. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge dismissed this argument at
    para. 17 of his September reasons: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>I am satisfied that there was material upon
    which the issuing judge could conclude that the warrant should issue.  In particular, I am of the view that he was
    entitled to conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the items
    sought were evidence of the offences described in the affidavit, and were in
    the named premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no basis to interfere with this finding.  A search warrant will be quashed when there
    were no reasonable grounds for the issuing judge to believe that the items
    sought were evidence of the offences described in the affidavit or when there
    were no reasonable grounds to believe that a search of the identified location
    would find evidence of those offences.  However, the standard is not an exacting one: see Scott C. Hutchison,
    James C. Morton &amp; Michael P. Bury, <i>Search
    and Seizure Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf, vol. 1 (Scarborough: Thomson
    Carswell, 2005) at 16—18.  “A practical,
    reasonable and non-technical probability that evidence is available, is all

    that the warrant was not executed according to its terms and conditions, the
    judge must order that all materials seized be returned to the owner; the judge
    has no discretion to order that any materials be sent to the requesting state.  The appellants rely on a passage from <i>R. v. Gladwin</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d)
    471 at para. 8 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1997] S.C.C.A.
    No. 325, for the proposition that there is no discretion to make a sending
    order in the face of a determination that the warrant was not executed
    according to its terms.  In <i>Gladwin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 8, Finlayson J.A. noted “the awkward language of
    this section, couched as it is in negatives and coupled with the disjunctive
    ‘or’ instead of the conjunctive ‘and’” and made the following observation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]his section
    imposes a double burden upon the judge called upon to make an order under s.
    15(1)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Act</i> sending the material seized to the foreign state.  He or she is obliged under s. 15(1)(<i>a</i>) to review what has transpired to the
    date of the return of the application.  <i>Before he can order that the record or thing
    seized be sent to the foreign state, the reviewing judge must be satisfied,
    first, that the warrant was executed according to its terms and conditions and,
    second, that he is satisfied that there is no reason why the order should not be
    made</i>. … [T]he inherent nature of this second condition necessarily bestows
    discretion on the reviewing judge to consider all relevant factors bearing on
    the application. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his September reasons, at para. 22, the
    application judge rejected the proposition that s. 15(1) should be interpreted
    in the manner suggested by the appellants.  He found that the use of the word “may”
    imported a discretion and that the interpretation advocated by the appellants
    would make little sense as a matter of policy as it would preclude a sending
    order even in the case of a minor or inadvertent failure to comply with the
    terms of the warrant.  As for <i>Gladwin</i>, the application judge pointed
    out that Finlayson J.A.’s comments were <i>obiter</i> as the issue under consideration here did not arise on the facts of that case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the application judge’s reasoning.  In my view, the passage quoted above from <i>Gladwin </i>should not be read as
    conclusively determining that on a s. 15 application, the judge has no
    discretion to make a sending order even where the departure from the terms of
    the warrant was minor or insignificant.  That
    was not the point at issue in <i>Gladwin</i> and Finalyson J.A.’s comment must be read in that light.  While the wording of s. 15(1) is not a model
    of clarity, I fail to see how one can ignore Parliament’s use of the word “may”
    as the preface to the description of the powers of the judge charged with the
    responsibility to determine whether it is appropriate to make a sending order.  The word “may” suggests the existence of a
    discretion.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also agree that it would be inappropriate, as
    a matter of policy, to adopt an interpretation of s. 15(1) that would require
    the judge to take a purely mechanical approach and refuse a sending order for
    every minor or trivial failure in the execution of the warrant.  In the domestic context, we do not take that
    approach when deciding whether or not to exclude evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  To apply a higher standard under the Act would
    hardly advance its purpose and object.  That
    purpose was described by Doherty J.A. in <i>Russian
    Federation v. Pokidyshev</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at para. 15 (Ont.

    is able to assist in
    combating the problem of international crime and to fulfil our “international
    obligations under various treaties and conventions to assist other states in
    the investigation and detection of [international] crime”.  This assessment of the purpose of the Act was
    reiterated by Rosenberg J.A. in <i>R. v.
    Budd</i> (2000), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 108 at para. 28 (Ont.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, a judge hearing the application for a
    sending order does not, in my view, have an unlimited or untrammelled
    discretion.  The discretion must be
    exercised in a manner that comports with the language and the overall purpose
    of the Act.  The language of s. 15(1)(<i>a</i>) clearly indicates that the lawful
    execution of the warrant is of primary concern.  The judge must rigorously scrutinize the
    manner in which the warrant was executed to determine whether there was any
    significant or meaningful failure to execute the warrant according to its
    terms.  If there was, the wording of the
    section requires the judge to refuse to make a sending order. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, I am satisfied that the
    application judge fulfilled that duty and that his decision to make a sending
    order fell within the limits of the discretion allowed under the statute.  While there was what the application judge
    described as “a significant over-seizure”, he concluded that the over-seizure
    “flowed largely from the overbreadth of the warrant,” not the failure to follow
    the terms and conditions of the warrant.  I agree with that assessment. </p>

    discretion to make a sending order despite the failure of the authorities to
    execute the warrant according to its precise terms.  I now turn to the issue of overbreadth, the
    real cause of the over-seizure. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(3) Did the application judge err by concluding that he could make a

    assumes that the role of the judge on a s. 15 application is the same as that
    of a judge asked to quash a search warrant before trial.  At that stage, the issue is simply the
    validity of the search warrant.  If the
    warrant is not valid, the applicant is legally entitled to have the warrant quashed
    and his property returned.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The proper analogy for a s. 15 application is to
    that of a trial judge asked to consider the admissibility into evidence of
    materials seized or their exclusion pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In <i>Gladwin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 9, this court
    analogized the role of a judge in a s. 15 hearing as “akin to that of a trial
    judge considering the admissibility into evidence of the things seized pursuant
    to a search warrant.”  Similarly in <i>Budd</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 26, this court held that “the impact of alleged <i>Charter </i>violations should be considered
    on the s. 15 hearing, <i>where the judge is
    exercising a jurisdiction akin to that of a trial judge</i>”. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The concern of a trial judge is with the use of
    the evidence at the trial.  The validity
    of the warrant is a relevant factor, but there is no automatic exclusion of
    evidence obtained pursuant to an invalid search warrant; the issue falls to be
    resolved under the broad discretion of the trial judge.  The role performed by a judge conducting a
    hearing under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter </i>is
    not precisely congruent to the role of a judge under s. 15. The matter is still
    at the investigative stage and the s. 15 judge is not in a position to assess
    the impugned evidence in terms of its importance or impact on the fairness of
    the trial.  However, it remains that just
    as at trial, the central focus and concern on a s. 15 review is on the <i>use of the evidence</i> against the
    respondent by the requesting state, rather than the narrower issue of the
    validity of the warrant and whether or not improperly seized evidence ought to
    be returned to the respondent.</p>

    apparent from an examination of the information and its appendices) did not
    preclude the sending judge from ordering the materials sent to the requesting

    By doing the detailed work of identifying the material that could have been properly

    application is certainly not required to take a mechanical approach and refuse
    to make a sending order simply because the search warrant was defective.  The core question under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> is “whether in a particular
    situation the public’s interest in being left alone by government must give way
    to the government’s interest in intruding on the individual’s privacy in order
    to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement” (<i>Hunter v. Southam</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145 at 159-60).  The issue under s.&nbsp;24(2) is whether
    allowing the authorities to use improperly seized items would “bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute”.  As I read his reasons, the application judge
    in this case carefully identified and weighed the appropriate competing
    concerns and concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, a sending order
    of selected items was appropriate despite the defective warrant.  Another judge might well have reached a
