    discloses that the two companies carry on business together in the nature of a

    the same person pursuant to s. 3(9) of the <i>Land
    Transfer Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.6 (<i>LTTA</i>)
    which provides:</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (<u>9</u>)  If the disposition of a beneficial interest
    in land is from one corporation to another corporation, each of which is an
    affiliate of the other immediately before and at the time of the disposition,
    the Minister may defer the payment of the tax payable by virtue of this section
    by the corporation acquiring the beneficial interest …</p>

    one looks to the language of s. 3(14) which, at the relevant time, read:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>3(14) Affiliate</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=clause-e><span lang=EN>&nbsp;
    (a)&nbsp; a corporation shall be deemed to be an affiliate of another
    corporation if one of them is the subsidiary of the other or if both are

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 apply in determining whether one corporation is an
    affiliate of another. Section 1(3) deals with control. It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            1(3)  A company shall be deemed to be controlled by another person or company
    or by two or more companies if,</p>

    held, otherwise than by way of security only, by or for the benefit of the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clearly, on the evidence here, the corporations
    are not controlled, as that term is defined, by the same person or persons. David
    holds all the voting shares of DAM, while his father holds the majority of the
    voting shares of MFHL.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue boils down to whether, as a matter of
    statutory interpretation, the deeming definition of “affiliate” in subsection
    3(14) is exhaustive. If it is, then it does not include <i>de facto</i> control and deferment is not available; if it is not, deferment
    may be available. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The modern approach to  statutory interpretation is simply stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he words of an
    Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the
    intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>See <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>, [1998]
    1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21, quoting Elmer A. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at
    p. 87.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further this approach has been held to apply to
    taxation statutes no less than it does to other statutes:  <i>Stubart</i> <i>Investments Ltd. v. The Queen</i>, [1984]
    1 S.C.R. 536 at 578. As LeBel J., writing for a unanimous court, noted in <i>Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario (Minister of Finance)</i>, [2006] 1
    S.C.R. 715 at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… because of the
    degree of precision and detail characteristic of many tax provisions, a greater
    emphasis has often been placed on textual interpretation where taxation
    statutes are concerned:  <i>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada</i>,
    [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, 2005 S.C.C. 54, at para. 11. Taxpayers are entitled to
    rely on the clear meaning of taxation provisions in structuring their affairs.
    Where the words of a statute are precise and unequivocal, those words will play
    a dominant role in the interpretive process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>and at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The interpretive
    approach is thus informed by the level of precision and clarity with which a
    taxing provision is drafted. Where such a provision admits of no ambiguity in
    its meaning or in its application to the facts, it must simply be applied.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>and
    at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although there is
    a residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer, it is residual only and
    applies in the exceptional case where application of the ordinary principles of
    interpretation does not resolve the issue. Any doubt about the meaning of a
    taxation statute must be reasonable, and no recourse to the presumption lies
    unless the usual rules of interpretation have been applied, to no avail, in an
    attempt to discern the meaning of the provision at issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue to be determined is whether s. 1(3) of
    the <i>Securities Act </i>effectively
    defines the term “control” or just sets out two examples of the circumstances
    that constitute control for the purpose of determining whether companies are
    affiliates and entitled to deferment of tax. More particularly, do the words
    “shall be deemed to be controlled…if” indicate that the conditions listed are
    exclusive? A useful comparison can be made to the language of s. 1(6) of the <i>Securities Act</i> which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>1(6) A company
    shall be deemed to own beneficially securities beneficially owned by its
    affiliates.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defining language in this section is “shall
    be deemed to”. This language indicates that without this section, one company
    does not beneficially own securities actually owned by another company. But for
    the purpose of determining whether one company controls another and is
    therefore an affiliate of the other within the definition in this section and
    for the purposes of the Act, s. 1(6) deems something to be the case, which is otherwise
    in fact not the case. It is a section that deems a thing to fall within a
    definition or category for the purpose of the section or the Act, when it would
    not otherwise be so characterized. In contrast, the use of the conditional word
    “if” in conjunction with “shall be deemed to be”, signifies an exclusive
    definition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It may have been more helpful had the
    legislature included a phrase such as was included in the legislation
    considered in <i>Regulvar Canada Inc. v.
    Ontario </i>(2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 641. That language read: “a body corporate shall
    be deemed to be controlled by another person or by two or more bodies corporate
    if, <u>but only if</u>…”. Although the latter words are not present in s. 3(14),
    nevertheless, in our view, the effect of the language is the same. The words “but
    only if” would be mere surplusage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The deeming provision in subsection 1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> states how ‘control’ is
    defined for the purposes of the <i>LTTA</i> – on the basis of majority voting rights. It says nothing of <i>de facto</i> control. Had the legislature
    intended that ‘control’ would include <i>de
    facto</i> control in addition to <i>de jure</i> control, as defined in subsection 1(3), it would have said so and not made
    specific reference to subsection 1(3) of the <i>Securities Act</i> which references only <i>de jure</i> control. See <i>Regulvar
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 14. The
    language is clear and admits of no ambiguity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also observe that in <i>Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795, the
    Supreme Court affirmed that under the <i>Income
    Tax Act</i>, “control” of a corporation normally refers to <i>de jure</i> and not <i>de facto </i>control.
    Writing for a unanimous court, Iacobucci J. noted that <i>“de jure </i>control has emerged as the Canadian standard, with the
    test for such control generally accepted to be whether the controlling party
    enjoys, by virtue of its shareholdings, the ability to elect the majority of
    the board of directors” (at para. 36). Both the <i>Income Tax Act </i>and the <i>LTTA</i> deal with the same general subject – tax – and are therefore presumed to
    operate together harmoniously. See Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto:
    Butterworths, 2002) at p. 328. In our view, it would be undesirable for a
    different standard to apply to “control” under the <i>LTTA </i>than to “control” under the <i>Income Tax Act</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span

    legal consequences, some of which accord rights while others impose
    obligations. It is essential that the definition of the term “affiliate” be
    clear and unambiguous so that a company may look to the definition and be able
    to know whether it has an obligation arising out of its affiliate status. It
    would be unworkable if the definition were to be applicable on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</p>

    Minister on a substantial indemnity scale. The respondent concedes in this
    court that there was no conduct on the part of the Ministry that would justify
    an award on that scale. That said, this
    case raised a novel point of statutory interpretation. When awarding costs, the
    novelty of an <span style='"Times New Roman";'>issue is a proper consideration
    both at first instance and on appeal. See

  <p style='text-autospace:none'>(2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 766 at paras. 9 - 10. In
    addition to the novelty of the issue, we note that the positions of both
    parties were reasonable and there is a public interest in having the relevant
    statutory provisions clarified. In these circumstances, in our view, it is
    appropriate that each side bear its own costs. Accordingly, we make no order as
    to costs, here or below. </p>
