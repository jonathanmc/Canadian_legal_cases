  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Zekrollah Walizadah, was tried before Ewaschuk&nbsp;J. and a jury
    at the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto for the first degree murder of
    Mohammadulah Saighani on December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1999.  The trial commenced
    on November&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2002.  On April&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2003, he was convicted
    as charged.  The appellant appeals his conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issue at trial was the identity of the killer.  There were no eyewitnesses
    to the murder and no forensic evidence linking the appellant to the crime.  The
    crucial Crown evidence was the testimony of the deceased’s wife, Nafisa Saighani,
    that the appellant had confessed to her that he had killed the deceased.  Ms.&nbsp;Saighani
    and the appellant had an extramarital affair both before and after the deceased
    was killed.  In the spring of 2000, the police began surveillance of the
    appellant and Ms.&nbsp;Saighani.  They were observed going to the Bolton
    Inn.  Their telephone conversations were intercepted.  The Crown argued that
    the evidence demonstrated that the appellant was passionately in love with
    Ms.&nbsp;Saighani and that he had murdered her husband to have her for himself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not testify or call a defence.  The defence position was that
    the surveillance and intercepted telephone conversations proved only that
    the appellant and Ms.&nbsp;Saighani were in the midst of a sexual affair.  The
    defence suggested that Ms.&nbsp;Saighani was an unstable woman who lied to
    police about the appellant’s confession in order to prevent her family from
    ostracizing her for her numerous affairs.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>B.        </span>FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the morning of December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1999, the body of Mohammadulah Saighani,
    a taxi driver, was discovered in a parking lot behind a warehouse at 37 Iron
    Street in the west end of Toronto.  Mr.&nbsp;Saighani had suffered about
    fifty stab wounds.  His spinal cord was severed and he was nearly decapitated.  Later
    that day, the deceased’s Beck taxicab was found four kilometres away at the
    Kipling Heights Plaza.  The deceased’s wife, Nafisa Saighani, told police
    that she had last seen her husband when he left for work at approximately
    6:30 that morning.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Video
    footage taken the morning of the homicide from a security camera located
    in the parking lot of the Kipling Heights Plaza depicted a minivan, presumably
    that of the deceased’s assailant, arriving in the parking lot at 4:50 a.m.  Two
    hours later, at 6:56 a.m., the deceased’s taxi entered the parking lot and
    parked next to the minivan.  Seconds later, the minivan left the parking
    lot.  Thus, the deceased’s taxi, having been driven by his assailant back
    to his own van at the Kipling Heights Plaza after the murder, was left at
    the plaza. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.&nbsp;Saighani
    was the Crown’s main witness.  In spite of overwhelming evidence from telephone
    records that she and the appellant had been having an affair for many months
    before the homicide, Ms.&nbsp;Saighani claimed that the affair began after
    her husband’s death.  She testified that nine months after the homicide,
    on September&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2000, she and the appellant had an argument during
    which he confessed to murdering her husband:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Then I said, “What do you want to do for me?”  He <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> I
    don’t know myself he hit me in the concrete or not, but I was like in shock.  I
    don’t know, but that time he told me, “Nafisa, the way I kill your husband
    I kill you too.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    cross&#8209;examination, Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s testimony was not as certain:</p>

    re&#8209;examination, Ms.&nbsp;Saighani was again asked about the appellant’s
    confession and testified that she was, after all, sure that the appellant
    had confessed to her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant knew that he was a suspect in the homicide at least two months
    before he was arrested.  In a statement given to the police prior to his
    arrest, the appellant acknowledged that he knew the deceased and his wife,
    who were regular customers at the Afghan grocery store where he worked, but
    denied that he had an affair with Ms.&nbsp;Saighani.  After his arrest, he
    gave another statement in which he admitted to the affair. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown
    counsel at trial objected to this component of the defence closing address.  She
    pointed out that the defence could have requested forensic testing of the
    four items.  The trial judge agreed and charged the jury in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, let me comment on Mr.&nbsp;Orr’s repeated
    refrain that the Crown failed to test significant items of evidence, particularly
    the two cigarette butts found in the rear of the public taxi.  Johanne Almer
    and Daryl Mayers from the Centre of Forensic Sciences both testified that
    the Centre does testing of submissions made by defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Had Mr.&nbsp;Orr really believed that the two items
    would have exculpated his client it was open to him to have submitted the
    item for scientific testing.  His failure to have done so may be telling.  However,
    it is nonetheless important to keep in mind that there is no onus on an accused
    whatsoever to prove his or her innocence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant objects to the instruction, especially the words “His failure to
    have done so may be telling.”  He contends that the trial judge implicitly
    suggested that defence counsel had not taken advantage of the opportunity
    to test the evidence because he did not believe in his client’s case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In light of the strong, highly critical language used by defence
    counsel in his closing address, it was certainly open to the trial judge
    to point out to the jury that the defence could have obtained forensic testing
    of evidence it deemed to be relevant.  Moreover, in my view the language
    employed by the trial judge in this component of his charge was appropriate.  Crucially,
    he emphasized that there was no onus on the defence to seek such testing.  Finally,
    the interpretation of the trial judge’s instruction advanced by the appellant <span style='"Times New Roman"'>– that
    the trial judge was telling the jury that defence counsel thought his client
    was probably guilty and that forensic testing of items found in the taxi
    might inculpate him – is not, in my view, a realistic one.  The more likely
    message in the instruction was that forensic testing of the four untested
    items would probably yield the same results as the extensive forensic testing
    of many other items –
    nothing to incriminate anyone.  Indeed, in his oral argument on this issue
    counsel for the appellant prefaced his legal submissions with the observation
    that forensic testing of the untested items would have been “pretty much
    a longshot”.  I agree and suspect that trial counsel saw it the same way. </span></p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>(2)       Intercepted telephone conversations between the
      appellant and his children</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early July 2000, six months after the homicide, the appellant left his family
    home and moved into an apartment above the store where he worked.  He was
    in the midst of his affair with Ms.&nbsp;Saighani.  On July 9 and 10, the
    appellant engaged in three telephone conversations with his children who
    begged him to return.  On July 12, the police informed the appellant that
    he was a suspect in the murder of the deceased.  On July 13, the appellant
    moved back into his home with his family.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence sought to exclude the intercepts of the three telephone conversations
    between the appellant and his children.  The trial judge ruled in favour
    of admission:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The accused Zekrollah Walizadah applies to exclude
    evidence obtained from two wiretaps Tape 67, Sides “A” and “B”.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The evidence consists of three phone calls by the
    accused’s children entreating him to return home.  The accused rejected their
    entreaties.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The evidence is undoubtedly highly probative as
    to motive and the depth of the accused’s passion for Nafisa Saighani, the
    deceased’s wife.  Furthermore, I am not satisfied that the accused’s rejection
    of his children entreaties to return home, constitutes disreputable conduct,
    particularly in light of the high rate of separation in Canadian families.  Spousal
    separation from children is a common feature in Canadian society and cannot
    be regarded as constituting disreputable conduct.  In fact, the jury has
    already heard that the accused prior to the three phone calls, had left his
    wife and children to live above his place of employment.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the end, the intercepts will be admitted, because
    their probative value clearly exceeds their minimal prejudicial effect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in making this ruling because
    it constituted evidence of bad character with a prejudicial effect that outweighed
    its probative value, especially since the defence was prepared to admit that
    the appellant  and Ms.&nbsp;Saighani were having an affair in July&nbsp;2000.</p>

    disagree.  The defence position throughout the trial was that the relationship
    between the appellant and Mr.&nbsp;Saighani was, in Mr.&nbsp;Orr’s words, “just
    another affair”.  The Crown, on the other hand, contended that the affair
    was utterly consuming for the appellant who was completely obsessed with
    Ms.&nbsp;Saighani and that this obsession served as the motive for murdering
    her husband.  In this context, the telephone conversations with his children,
    during which he rejected their entreaties to come home, were relevant evidence
    to support the Crown’s position.  I agree.</p>

    the telephone conversations were also relevant to understand the appellant’s
    thinking and conduct in mid&#8209;July when he was formally told by the police
    that he was a suspect.  On July&nbsp;10, he was so much in love with Ms.&nbsp;Saighani
    that he refused to come home.  On July&nbsp;13, one day after he was told
    that he was a suspect, he returned to his home.</p>

    did not seek such an instruction after the ruling or object to its absence
    in the jury charge.  Moreover, I agree with the trial judge's observation
    that the appellant’s conversations with his children did not really constitute
    disreputable conduct in the context of a society with a high rate of marital
    separation.  Finally, even if the appellant’s words in his conversations
    with his children were evidence of disreputable conduct, when that conduct
    is relevant to the issue of the accused’s motive a limiting instruction is
    not required: see <i>R. v. Merz</i> (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d)  259 at paras.

    King was an important witness called by the Crown.  The deceased’s taxi was
    driven back to Kipling Heights Plaza (almost certainly by the killer) shortly
    before 7:00 a.m. on December 30, 1999.  The driver (who cannot be seen on
    the security video) parked the taxi next to the van that had been parked
    there at 4:50 a.m., entered the van, and started to back out of the parking
    space.  Ms.&nbsp;King, an employee at a store in the plaza, was arriving
    for work.  She entered the parking lot and needed to brake to avoid the van.  Several
    days later, after seeing the security video on a newscast, Ms.&nbsp;King

    dark&#8209;blue GMC Safari with double rear doors and a licence in the middle
    of the door.  She had worked with and knew cars.  The police re&#8209;enactments
    were a futile and flawed attempt to refute her evidence.  In the end, her
    evidence withstood scrutiny and proves beyond doubt that the murderer’s vehicle
    was not the accused’s vehicle.  Thus, the accused was not Mr.&nbsp;Saighani’s
    killer.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his instructions to the jury, the trial judge again referred to Ms.&nbsp;King’s
    evidence, this time under a separate heading:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>DENICE KING</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Denice King testified that on December 30, 1999,
    she was in a hurry to get to work on time.  She was cutting it close.  On
    her arrival at the Kipling Heights Plaza a van backed out in front of her
    forcing her to apply her brakes.  At that time it was still dark and she
    did not pay particular attention to the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On January 6, 2000, Ms. King heard a police broadcast
    or at least a broadcast asking for assistance in finding the van.  She thought
    back about the van.  Her best recollection is that it was a square&#8209;back,
    dark&#8209;blue GMC Safari with double rear doors and the licence plate in
    the middle of one of the doors.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Obviously, you should carefully assess the reliability
    of Ms.&nbsp;King’s evidence, having regard to the inherent frailties of identification
    evidence.  Simply put, honest and sincere witnesses are often mistaken when
    it comes to later identifying persons or things of which they have only a
    fleeting glance.  That is referred to as the
    “inherent frailties of identification evidence.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown submits that Ms.&nbsp;King is an honest
    and sincere witness but that her evidence is unreliable.  The Crown relies
    on the surveillance tape itself, the re&#8209;enactment tapes, and the still
    photos of the suspect van as establishing that Ms.&nbsp;King is mistaken.  The
    suspect vehicle was round&#8209;shaped at the back and light in colour.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>By contrast, the accused submits that Ms.&nbsp;King
    has no reason to lie, and that her evidence is reliable because she knows
    cars and vans.  She used to work at a lube shop.  Defence counsel commends
    Ms.&nbsp;King’s evidence and submits that her evidence proves that it was
    not Mr.&nbsp;Walizadah’s round&#8209;shaped Voyageur van at the Kipling Heights
    Plaza on the morning of December 30th,&nbsp;1999.</p>

    and balanced.  He described her testimony accurately <span style='"Times New Roman"'>– she
    thought she saw “a square&#8209;back, dark&#8209;blue GMC Safari with double
    rear doors”.  He then reviewed in an even&#8209;handed fashion the factors
    supporting and calling into question the reliability of this testimony.  Against
    this background, and bearing in mind that Ms. King went to the police about
    a week after the murder, that it was dark when she saw the van, that she
    saw it only briefly, and that there was no reason at the time for her to
    concentrate on the model and colour of the van, there was nothing wrong with
    the trial judge giving the jury what I would call a common sense caution
    about the frailties of identification evidence.</span></p>

    42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In our view, the preferable approach recognizes
    the dangers of video re-enactments but adopts a case-by-case analysis. As
    with the admissibility of other kinds of evidence, the overriding principle
    should be whether the prejudicial effect of the video re-enactment outweighs
    its probative value. If it does, the video re-enactment should not be admitted.
    In balancing the prejudicial and probative value of a video re-enactment,
    trial judges should at least consider the video’s relevance, its accuracy,
    its fairness, and whether what it portrays can be verified under oath. [Citation
    omitted.] Other considerations may be material depending on the case. And
    as with rulings on admissibility of other kinds of evidence, the trial judge’s
    decision to admit or exclude a video re-enactment is entitled to deference
    on appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    the court in <i>MacDonald</i> held that the trial judge erred in admitting
    the video re-enactment in question.  First, the video lacked probative value
    due to its many inaccuracies.  The re-enactment entailed recreating a failed
    ‘takedown’ of the accused.  The re-enactment was shot at a different time
    of day and year, at a different location (the takedown occurred at a city
    intersection, but the video was filmed at a deserted sand quarry), at a different
    speed and used a different vehicle.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the video in <i>MacDonald</i> was highly prejudicial because it portrayed
    only the police officers’ version of events.  The court stated at para. 48: “Courts
    must be sensitive to how a video re-enactment that depicts only the Crown’s
    version of disputed facts may distort the jury’s decision-making and thus
    prejudice an accused’s right to a fair trial.”</p>

    slightly different situation presented itself before this court in <i>R.
    v. Collins</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85.  In that case, the police conducted
    an experiment to determine if a target would be hit when shots were fired
    in a way described by a witness in the case.  A video was made of the experiment
    and played for the jury.  In addition, the sergeant responsible for the experiment
    testified at the trial.  The appeal concerned the admissibility of experiment
    evidence.  Charron J.A. said at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In a nutshell, experiment evidence, if it is relevant
    to an issue in the case, should generally be admitted, subject to the trial
    judge’s residuary discretion to exclude the evidence where the prejudice
    that would flow from its admission clearly outweighs its value. </p>

    at para. 22, Charron J.A. stated that
    “[i]n most cases, the relevance of the experiment evidence will depend on
    the degree of similarity between the replication and the original event.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Collins</i>,

    relevant and material and no prejudice had been demonstrated.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court had a further opportunity to consider experiment and re-enactment evidence
    in <i>R. v. Nikitin</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 225.  In that case, the accused
    failed to stop for a school bus and a young boy was killed.  The police tried
    to re-enact the scenario to determine when the school bus would have been
    perceptible and a video of the re-enactment was played for the jury.  Relying
    on <i>Collins</i>, the court held that the evidence was admissible despite
    some differences between the actual event and the re-enactment.  The court
    said, at para. 14, that the differences did not render the evidence sufficiently
    unreliable to be inadmissible: “It is impossible for a pre-trial experiment
    to replicate the original event perfectly.”  An important factor for the
    court in that case was that the “trial judge was comprehensive and scrupulous
    in his charge to the jury on this issue. He identified all of the factors
    that the defence suggested should diminish the weight to be given to the
    experiment evidence” (para. 15). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Nikitin</i>,
    the court noted, at para. 11, that the evidence in question was at once a
    re-enactment and an experiment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I begin with the observation that the words
    “re-enactment” and “experiment” are both apt descriptors of the police evidence. “Re-enactment” is
    accurate because the police sought to replicate the conditions (location,
    vehicles, time of day, weather) and some, but not all, of the relevant events
    (driving until the bus was seen, but not to the point of impact). “Experiment” is
    also accurate because the purpose of the partial re-enactment was to identify
    the potential “point of first perception” of the school bus by a driver.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this accurately describes the evidence in the present appeal.  On
    the one hand, the videos were replications of the point when Ms. King’s vehicle
    passed the van.  On the other hand, the videos were an experiment to determine
    how vans of different shades and shapes would appear when illuminated by
    another vehicle.  Therefore, the principles enunciated in both <i>MacDonald</i> (concerning
    video re-enactments) and <i>Collins </i>(concerning experiment evidence)
    are relevant to the present case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    overriding principle from both <i>MacDonald </i>and <i>Collins</i> is that,
    as with all evidence, re-enactment and experiment evidence should not be
    admissible where the prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  While
    the parties referred the trial judge to these cases in their submissions,
    the trial judge did not expressly advert to this balancing process in his
    brief rulings on the admissibility of the videos in this case.  Nevertheless,
    when this balancing process is conducted, it becomes apparent that the trial
    judge did not err in admitting the re-enactment videos.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the videos were relevant and material to the issue of the reliability of
    Ms. King’s identification of the van.  The evidence was led to establish
    that Ms. King mistakenly identified the van as a dark GMC Safari, as opposed
    to a light, round-backed minivan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the re-enactments were fairly accurate.  The appellant points to a number
    of discrepancies between the original surveillance video and the re-enactments,
    including differences in film quality and lighting.  The trial judge was
    alive to these issues and fairly held that the differences were not so great
    so as to diminish the probative value of the evidence.  It is clear from
    the jurisprudence that a standard of perfection is not expected in the creation
    of video re-enactments.  In this case, the police shot the re-enactments
    from the same view as the original tape and with the same camera, the same
    location was used, and they tried to emulate the darkness of the original
    tape.  </p>

    unlike <i>MacDonald</i>, the videos in this case did not portray a one-sided
    account of disputed facts.  Rather, the videos presented several different
    scenarios in order to allow the jury to draw their own conclusions about
    what actually occurred in the surveillance footage.  </p>

    sum, it is my view that the trial judge did not err in admitting the two
    video re-enactments.  While there were some differences between the original
    surveillance video and the re-enactments, the differences were not so great
    so as to deprive the evidence of its probative value.  The appellant has
    not established that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its
    probative value. </p>

    trial judge permitted Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson, the officer in
    charge of preparing the video re-enactment evidence, to give his opinion
    about what he saw on the two re-enactment videos and on the original plaza
    surveillance video.  His ruling on this issue was: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is my conclusion that the witness will be permitted
    to testify as to what he purportedly sees on the films.  In other words,
    he will be permitted, for example, to say whether the particular vehicle
    in question appears to be round or square in shape, and whether the particular
    vehicle appears to be light or dark in colour.  However, the witness will
    not be permitted to say that the van on the surveillance film appears to
    be similar to that driven by the accused….</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant
    to this ruling, Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson testified about both
    the original plaza surveillance video and the two re-enactment videos.  He
    said that the suspect vehicle in the surveillance video of December 30, 1999
    appeared “very light in colour”
    when it was lit up by Ms. King’s vehicle.  He was then asked about the four
    vans that appeared in the March 23, 2000 re-enactment.  He testified that
    the first Plymouth Voyager, which was maroon, remained dark in colour when
    the second vehicle illuminated the area.  Regarding the black Ford Aerostar,
    Detective Sergeant Sanson stated:
    “This one, as well as the first one, despite all the light that hit it, still
    seems to me as represented by being dark on the video.”  Similarly, Detective
    Sergeant Sanson testified that the GMC Safari “remained dark [in] colour” and
    that “more defined edging” could be seen.  The Crown then asked him to compare
    the GMC Safari to the van shown in the surveillance video of December 30,
    1999.  Detective Sergeant Sanson stated that the van had “a rounded back
    to it, which is about all you can see.”  He further stated, “I can see it
    is a light colour, in my opinion.”  Next, the detective testified that the
    dark blue Ford Windstar remained dark when it was illuminated by other vehicles.
    Finally, Detective Sergeant Sanson provided testimony regarding the second
    re-enactment video of April 12, 2000.  He stated that like the van in the
    original surveillance video, the light green Plymouth Voyager used in the
    second re-enactment “seem[ed] to light up” when the other vehicle illuminated
    it.</p>

    is no doubt that Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson’s testimony was a combination
    of fact and opinion.  Indeed, counsel for the respondent acknowledged, fairly,
    this point in his oral argument.  The question then becomes: was the officer’s
    opinion evidence admissible?</p>

    leading case dealing with admission of non&#8209;expert opinion evidence
    is <i>R. v. Graat</i> (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 365 (S.C.C.).  In that case,
    Dickson&nbsp;J. said at p. &nbsp;378:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To resolve the question before the court, I would
    like to return to broad principles.  Admissibility is determined, first,
    by asking whether the evidence sought to be admitted is relevant.  This is
    a matter of applying logic and experience to the circumstances of the particular
    case.  The question which must then be asked is whether, though probative,
    the evidence must be excluded by a clear ground of law or policy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Detective&nbsp;Sergeant
    Sanson’s non&#8209;expert opinion evidence was clearly relevant and potentially
    probative on two central and related issues at the trial <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> what
    type of van did the plaza’s surveillance video show and was Ms.&nbsp;King’s
    testimony about the van she saw reliable?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In<i> Graat</i>,
    Dickson&nbsp;J. identified a number of policy considerations that might outweigh
    probative value <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> the danger of confusing
    the issues or misleading the jury, unfair surprise, and undue consumption
    of time (p.&nbsp;378).  None of these policy considerations arises in this
    case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Dickson also noted another important consideration, namely, “there may be
    a tendency for judges and juries to let the opinion of police witnesses overwhelm
    the opinion evidence of other witnesses” (p.&nbsp;381).  The appellant submits
    that this is the danger or prejudice here, that the jury might have attached
    too much weight to Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson’s opinion and used
    it improperly to reject or diminish Ms.&nbsp;King’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The especially important point here, in my view, is that Ms.&nbsp;King’s
    testimony and Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson’s testimony, although clearly
    significant, were not the most important evidence before the jury concerning
    the van parked in the plaza.  The key evidence before the jury was the plaza’s
    surveillance video.  Crucially, this is precisely what the trial judge told
    the jury, both in his mid&#8209;trial instruction before the officer testified
    and in his jury charge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his mid&#8209;trial instruction, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Insofar as Detective Sergeant Sanson’s evidence
    is concerned, ultimately it will be for you to decide what is shown on the
    films.  It is your duty and your responsibility to determine, if you can,
    the shape of the van on the surveillance film and whether it is light or
    dark in colour.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Graat</i>,
    Dickson&nbsp;J. observed, at p.&nbsp;381, that “in every case, in determining
    whether an opinion is admissible, the trial judge must necessarily exercise
    a large measure of discretion.”  I cannot say that the trial judge in this
    case erred by admitting the non&#8209;expert opinion of Detective&nbsp;Sergeant&nbsp;Sanson.  In
    his ruling, he set out the relevant case law and assessed the competing arguments
    before reaching his decision.  In his mid&#8209;trial instruction and his
    jury charge, he properly focussed the jury’s attention on their independent
    assessment of the crucial piece of evidence on this issue <span

  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(5)       Caution
      re Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s testimony</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no doubt that the most important component of the Crown case was the appellant’s
    alleged confession to Ms.&nbsp;Saighani.  In pre&#8209;charge submissions,
    the appellant sought a <i>Vetrovec</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> warning with respect to Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s testimony.  The
    trial judge refused to do so on the basis that she was not an unsavoury witness.  However,
    he indicated that he would give a strong caution about Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his jury charge, the trial judge said this about Ms.&nbsp;Saighani:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='page-break-after:avoid'><u>NAFISA SAIGHANI</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Nafisa Saighani, the deceased’s wife and the accused’s
    lover, testified initially during cross&#8209;examination by Crown counsel
    that the accused Zekrollah Walizadah threatened to kill her the way he had
    killed her husband.  This alleged confession by the outrage accused followed
    his discovery of Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani with her new boyfriend, Flash Daoud.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, during cross&#8209;examination by defence
    counsel, Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani conceded that she was not sure that the accused
    had admitted to her that he had killed her husband.  She conceded that he
    might not have said that.  Yet, during recross&#8209;examination by Crown
    counsel, Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani burst into tears and testified that she was indeed
    sure that the accused had told her that he had killed her husband.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Obviously, the witness Nafisa Saighani has given
    contradictory versions of the alleged confession under oath.  Either she
    is sure that the accused confessed to her or she is not sure.  Given Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani’s
    inconsistency under oath on this most material matter, I warn you to be most
    circumspect in assessing her evidence as to the alleged confession.  Also
    keep in mind that she likely lied under oath in her denials of having sex
    with the accused and Ajay Sharma before her husband’s death. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the end, it is open to you to find that the accused
    had indeed confessed to her that he had killed her husband, though you may
    do so only after keeping in mind the need for extreme caution, and only after
    assessing her evidence on this matter in the context of all of the other
    evidence including the accused’s alleged confession to Javid Wali on the
    same day, that is September 17th, the year 2000.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You should carefully assess the evidence of Ramin
    Saighani, Flash Daoud, and particularly Javid Wali.  You must decide whether
    their evidence, particularly as to the accused’s emotional condition, and
    his statements tends to confirm Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani’s evidence as to the accused’s
    threat to her and his alleged confession.  Please look for confirmatory evidence
    before you feel it is safe to accept her evidence as to the alleged confession.  However,
    in the end it is open to you to find as fact after keeping in mind the need
    for caution, and even in the absence of confirmatory evidence that the accused
    indeed had confessed to her that he had killed her husband.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that this caution was inadequate because Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s
    evidence was fraught with inconsistencies and blatant lies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that something akin to a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was required,
    but submits that the warning set out above falls four&#8209;square into this
    category.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    begin with the observation that there is a good deal of discretion in the
    formulation of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning and that a trial judge’s formulation
    is entitled to substantial deference from an appellate court.  As expressed
    by Moldaver and LaForme JJ.A. in <i>R. v. Zebedee</i> (2006), 211 C.C.C.
    (3d) 199 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 83 and 84:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Hence, in a case like this, where the issue on appeal
    is not whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction should have been given, but
    whether the instruction given was adequate, appellate courts will not test
    the adequacy of the instruction against some pre-formulated format or prescribed
    terminology, but will decide whether the instruction, read in the context
    of the case and the rest of the charge, serves the purpose intended by a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution.  If
    the instruction meets that criterion, there is no misdirection.  Trial judges
    are owed considerable deference in determining how best to frame the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution.  They
    are much better situated than appellate courts to determine how to provide
    a particular jury with an effective and balanced <i>Vetrovec</i> caution
    tailored to the circumstances of the particular case. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In sum, where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning has been
    given, appellate intervention will be justified only where the appellant
    can show that in all of the circumstances, the warning as framed clearly
    failed to convey to the jury the appropriate degree of caution required for
    the particular witness or witnesses to whom the caution was addressed.  [Footnotes

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       the evidence of certain witnesses is identified

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)       the jury is cautioned that although it
    is entitled to act on the unconfirmed evidence of such a witness, it is dangerous
    to do so; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)       the jury is cautioned to look for other
    independent evidence which tends to confirm material parts of the evidence

    my view, the trial judge's warning in this case complied with all four of
    these points.  Ms. Saighani was singled out as requiring special scrutiny;
    reasons for this special scrutiny were explicitly identified <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> her
    inconsistent accounts under oath of the appellant’s confession and her lies
    under oath about not having sex with other men, including the appellant,
    before her husband’s murder; the jury was warned to be “most circumspect” and
    reminded of the need for “extreme caution” in assessing her evidence; and
    the jury was cautioned to look for independent confirmatory evidence, of
    which the trial judge gave possible examples.</p>

    short, although the trial judge said that he was not going to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning

    appellant contends that the trial judge committed two errors in his treatment
    of the evidence of Javid Wali, Ms.&nbsp;Saighani’s estranged son&#8209;in&#8209;law.  Mr.
    Wali testified that on September 17, 2000, the same day Ms.&nbsp;Saighani
    testified that the appellant confessed to her, the appellant said to him,
    referring to Flash Daoud, another man with whom Ms.&nbsp;Saighani had an
    affair: “If she had sex with that guy she is the killer of her husband.  If
    she did not have sex with that guy, they can catch me.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge charged the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The statement is not absolutely clear in meaning.  However,
    assuming you find as fact that the accused made this statement, it would
    be open to you, though you need not so infer, that the accused was stating
    implicitly that he had killed Mr.&nbsp;Saighani.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I repeat: You need not infer that the statement
    constitutes a confession as opposed to false braggadocio, though it is open
    to you to do so.  Please assess the statement in the context of the accused’s
    outrage at finding Mrs.&nbsp;Saighani with Flash Daoud.  In the end, you
    must be satisfied that the words constitute an unequivocal confession before
    you may use them in that fashion against the accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the statement made to Mr. Wali was, at best, ambiguous
    and, in reality, devoid of meaning and therefore could not amount to an explicit
    or implicit confession.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The position of the defence at trial was not that the statement
    was devoid of meaning, but rather that Mr.&nbsp;Wali had fabricated it.  Moreover,
    for the trial judge to tell the jury that the statement was meaningless would
    have amounted to an improper interference with the fact&#8209;finding of
    the jury.  Finally, the trial judge’s charge on this issue struck a strong
    and appropriate note of caution.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s second submission on this issue is that the trial judge made
    an improper comment in his charge about Mr.&nbsp;Wali’s evidence.  Near the
    end of his charge, the trial judge corrected a small number of statements
    made very vigorously (if not in an inflammatory fashion) by defence counsel
    in his closing address.  One of the corrections related to the testimony
    of Mr.&nbsp;Wali:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Orr submitted that Javid Wali is not to be believed
    as to the accused’s implicit confession.  In other words, he fabricated that
    statement.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please ask yourselves the following question:  Why
    would the witness Javid Wali fabricate the accused’s words in such oblique
    language?  Would not have Mr. Wali testified that the accused expressly told
    him that he had killed Dr.&nbsp;Saighani had the witness really wanted to
    fabricate a false confession against the accused?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In that regard, you may compare the words attributed
    to the accused by Javid Wali with the words used by the accused during a
    wiretap and probe interceptions.  Is the language similar to its figurative,
    oblique, and indirect style of speaking in the Dari language?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that this instruction further compounded the trial judge’s
    error relating to Mr.&nbsp;Wali’s evidence about the appellant’s alleged
    confession.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In light of defence counsel’s strong attack on Mr.&nbsp;Wali’s
    testimony, the very real ambiguity in the appellant’s reported statement
    to Mr.&nbsp;Wali, and the acknowledged right of the trial judge to comment
    on the evidence, I cannot conclude that the trial judge’s comment amounted
    to an error.  In short, it did not cross the line into the realm of impermissible
    comment.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge said that the appellant’s after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct “may
    give rise to consciousness or awareness of fault.”  The appellant submits
    that
    “consciousness of fault” is a loaded term that is no better than the phrase
    “consciousness of guilt” which the Supreme Court of Canada and this court
    have said should be avoided: see <i>R. v. White </i>(1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d)
    385 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the appellant’s submission on this point.  It is surprising and
    regrettable that an experienced trial judge would think that it is appropriate
    to use the phrase “consciousness of fault” in place of “consciousness of
    guilt.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    same trial judge used the same phrase in another criminal trial.  In the
    appeal reasons in that case, <i>R. v. Babinski</i> (2005), 193 C.C.C. (3d)
    172 (Ont.C.A.), which, in fairness, were released after the trial in the
    present case, Doherty J.A. said at paras. 55 and&nbsp;56:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I see no value or purpose in using either phrase.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The phrase “consciousness of fault” does not add
    to a jury’s understanding of the potential value of this evidence and is
    consequently best avoided.  Its use here, however, did not amount to an error
    of law and did not occasion any unfairness to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, both components of Doherty&nbsp;J.A.’s analysis are equally applicable
    in this appeal <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> the trial judge should not have used the phrase “consciousness
    of fault”; however, its use did not amount to an error in principle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s second submission is that the trial judge did not adequately
    explain that there were innocent explanations for the appellant’s statements
    and conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In <i>White</i>,<i> supra</i>, Major&nbsp;J. stated at para. 57:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]here is a risk that juries might jump too quickly
    from evidence of post&#8209;offence conduct to an inference of guilt.  However,
    the best way for a trial judge to address that danger is simply to make sure
    that the jury are aware of any other explanations for the accused’s actions,
    and that they know they should reserve their final judgment about the meaning
    of the accused’s conduct until all the evidence has been considered in the
    normal course of their deliberations.  Beyond such a cautionary instruction,
    the members of jury should be left to draw whatever inferences they choose
    from the evidence at the end of the day.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s charge complied with this mandate.  He instructed
    the jury both to consider other explanations for the appellant’s conduct
    and to assess the conduct in the context of all the evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I should caution you that no one item of this type
    of post&#8209;offence conduct establishes guilt.  It or they only constitute
    an item or items of evidence, which, when weighed together with all the other
    evidence, may establish guilt.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Furthermore, you may act on the particular item
    of after&#8209;the&#8209;fact circumstantial or indirect evidence only if
    you reject as untrue or invalid any reasonable explanation supporting the
    explanation for the accused’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is true that in this section of his charge, the trial judge did not set out
    the possible innocent explanations for the conduct.  However, he did this
    elsewhere, specifically in his review of the defence position.  He pointed
    out that the appellant continued to openly drive his van after the murder
    (relevant to item 1 of after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct): “Assuming that
    the accused was the killer, it is also bizarre that the accused would continue
    his affair with the deceased’s wife and drive the van he used shortly before
    and shortly after the killing”.  He also mentioned the obvious reason for
    the appellant’s lie about his affair with Ms.&nbsp;Saighani (relevant to
    items 2 to 4): “That lie does not, however, prove that he was the killer.  No
    one brags about having sex with a married woman.  No, they hide it.”  As
    well, the trial judge mentioned other aspects of the appellant’s conduct
    which, arguably, were not consistent with his having committed the murder.  For
    example, the trial judge said: “On July 10th, 2000, the accused voluntarily
    consented to giving the police his hairs and blood.  The accused did not
    fear the police.  He acted with an innocent mind.  At that time, the accused
    had not yet retained a lawyer for legal advice.”  Finally, I note that, after
    the jury had been deliberating for several hours, the trial judge offered
    to expand his charge on after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct, including a re&#8209;emphasis
    of the non&#8209;incriminating explanation component of the issue.  Defence
    counsel requested that the trial judge not do this.  The trial judge accepted
    the request.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s charge on the appellant’s
    after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct warrants this court’s interference.</p>
