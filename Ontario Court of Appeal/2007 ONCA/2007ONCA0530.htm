style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel raises three issues in this Crown
    appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1)        the trial judge erred in failing to admit
    the evidence of each of the complainants as similar fact evidence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2)        the trial judge erred in failing to admit
    the decision of the Complaints Committee of the College of Physicians and
    Surgeons which advised the accused to have a third party present during
    physical examinations of his patients; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3)        the trial judge erred in permitting the
    accused's counsel to cross-examine two of the complainants on reports of other
    complaints they made of sexual abuse.  The trial judge compounded this error by failing to give a limiting
    instruction to the jury in respect of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the rejection of the similar fact evidence
    the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Because of the amount of
    publicity, and the number of the complainant witnesses [who] discussed the
    matter before going to the police amongst themselves, I am satisfied that there
    is some indication that the evidence is tainted.  There may not be collusion, but there is the
    appearance that it might be.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This conclusion makes evident that the trial
    judge considered there was an air of reality to the allegation of collusion and
    that the Crown had not satisfied the burden on it to show on a balance of
    probabilities that the evidence was not the product of concoction.  See <i>R.
    v. Shearing </i>(2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.) at para. 41.  We are satisfied that the trial judge applied
    the correct test and we would defer to the exercise of his discretion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the second issue, the Crown at
    trial sought to file what was said to be a decision of the Complaints Committee
    of the College of Physicians and Surgeons that concluded with advice to the accused
    that he have a third-party present during intimate physical examinations.  The trial judge refused to admit this
    evidence on the basis that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative
    value.  We see no error in this exercise
    of his discretion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel further submitted that its cross-examination
    on this issue was erroneously limited when the accused took the witness stand.
    We would not give effect to this argument as the record indicates that Crown
    counsel did not lay sufficient ground-work to permit him to cross-examine the
    accused on the advice contained in the decision of the Complaints Committee. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In regard to the third ground, Crown counsel
    conceded in the appeal that some cross-examination on the prior complaints of
    sexual abuse made by two of the complainants was permitted by the principle in <i>R. v. Riley </i>(1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 151
    (C.A.).  However, the Crown argues that
    the defence went too far in its cross- examinations and thereby breached the
    rule against leading evidence on collateral matters.  We disagree. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel further submits that the trial
    judge erred in instructing the jury in regard to one complainant as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Defence counsel also
    raised an issue that she is not afraid to go to the police.  He draws attention to two police reports. One
    where her daughter was allegedly [stalked] by someone and someone called Dustin
    assaulted her daughter.  Apparently the
    police report indicated that there was nothing to be found along those
    lines.  That is all evidence to be taken
    into account [in] assessing the credibility of the witness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the complainant had tacitly acknowledged what
    the police reports said, we see no error in the trial judge instructing the
    jury that it could consider the cross-examination about the police reports in
    assessing the witness's credibility.  The
    jury could have used the information for no other purpose as the events
    referred to in the police reports had no other relevance to the charges before
    the court.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
