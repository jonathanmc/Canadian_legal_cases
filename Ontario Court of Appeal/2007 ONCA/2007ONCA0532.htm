style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was convicted of sexual
    interference, sexual exploitation and sexual assault upon his daughter.  The only issue at trial was credibility.  The trial judge concluded that he disbelieved
    the appellant and found that his testimony did not raise a reasonable
    doubt.  He found that the complainant’s
    testimony established that the appellant had frequently touched her for sexual
    purpose with his hands, fondled her breasts, touched her vagina and digitally
    penetrated her.  However, because of
    significant discrepancies in the complainant’s accounts of the events given
    before and at trial, the trial judge was not convinced beyond a reasonable
    doubt by her testimony that sexual intercourse occurred or that she was tied up
    on one occasion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In explaining why he disbelieved the appellant,
    the trial judge explained “[the appellant] testified that [the complainant]
    liked to show herself naked and regularly failed to close her bathroom
    door.  He obviously testified to this
    fact in order to lead an attack against [the complainant’s] character.”  The trial judge indicated that this evidence
    had no relevance to the real issue before the court, and therefore he concluded
    the appellant’s motivation in giving it was suspect.  Secondly, he stated that the appellant’s
    testimony “was contradicted on this point by both his parents and by his son…who
    testified that they never observed nor had knowledge of conduct of this nature
    on the part of [the complainant].”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the trial judge’s analysis suffers
    from both errors of fact and principle.  The appellant’s mother did, in fact, indicate she had knowledge of such
    behaviour on the part of the complainant.  Moreover, the record does not support the characterization of the
    appellant’s testimony as leading a calculated attack on the complainant’s
    character.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, in his testimony in chief,
    described the complainant only in positive terms.  This particular evidence was elicited by the
    Crown in cross-examination.  While it may
    well have had little relevance, the Crown attorney asked the appellant to give
    an account of the occasions on which he had seen the complainant naked after
    her eleventh birthday.  The appellant
    provided factual and un-embellished answers to the questions he was asked.  His mother confirmed that he had earlier
    commented on such behaviour by the complainant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, we are of the view that the trial
    judge placed undue weight on the appellant’s testimony that he took his
    daughter with him alone to Wal-Mart’s,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Harvey’s
    and other public places.  While there was
    ample evidence that the appellant had the opportunity to commit the offences,
    the use of this particular testimony to contradict his claim he was rarely
    alone with her is overreaching.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><b><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b>When these elements are removed from the
    trial judge’s analysis it is not apparent that he, nevertheless, would have
    reached the conclusion that the appellant’s testimony failed to raise a
    reasonable doubt in his mind.  Therefore,
    we allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial. </p>
