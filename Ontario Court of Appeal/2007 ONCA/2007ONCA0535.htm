    extradition judge erred in his refusal to stay the proceeding on the ground
    that the actions of the Canadian authorities in the handling of the Canadian
    charges laid against him and in their handling of the extradition matter
    amounted to an abuse of process.  In
    relation to the surrender order, he contends that the surrender is contrary to
    s. 6(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i> and is unjust and oppressive (a) because of the potentially
    severe penalty to which Mr. Magnifico may be subject if convicted in the United
    States, (b) because of the abuse of process referred to above, and (c) because
    there is no evidence to support the offence on which Mr. Magnifico is sought to
    be extradited. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant is alleged to have supplied
    ecstasy in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto to American couriers who
    transported the drugs to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida

    arrested in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    and agreed to co-operate with the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    authorities.  As part of that co-operation, two of them –
    the Provenzano brothers, Santino and Steve – agreed to act as agents for the
    authorities and travelled to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    where they participated in a number of “buys” from Mr. Magnifico, each
    involving approximately 5,000 ecstasy pills.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 11, 2002, Mr. Magnifico was arrested,
    along with another Canadian, Richard Savinetti, and charged in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    with a
    number of drug-related offences involving ecstasy and hashish.    Mr. Magnifico was released on bail, subject
    to relatively strict conditions which were gradually relaxed to some extent at
    a number of court appearances over the next two and a half years leading up to
    the events giving rise to this appeal.  His charges were adjourned several times over this same period to await
    an extradition request from the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 4, 2003, Mr. Savinetti pleaded
    guilty in the Canadian proceedings to one count of possession for the purpose
    of trafficking and two counts of failure to comply.  He was given a conditional sentence of two
    years less a day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Almost a year later, Canadian authorities
    received a request for extradition from the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    , and on October 4,
    2004, an authority to proceed to extradition was issued.  Counsel for the Attorney General applied for
    an arrest warrant under the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    November 3, 2004, the appellant was arrested.  The Canadian charges against him were adjourned to be dealt with on
    April 11, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two offences under Canadian law are named in the
    authority to proceed.  They are: (1)
    conspiracy to traffic in a Schedule III substance, and (2) conspiracy to import
    into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    a Schedule III substance.  Ecstasy is a
    Schedule III drug.  The Record of the
    Case for Prosecution in relation to the extradition relied heavily on the
    anticipated testimony of persons who have been charged, or who have pleaded
    guilty in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>

    in relation to the comparable American offences.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing happened with respect to the Canadian
    charges between November 2004, when the appellant was arrested on the
    extradition warrant, and March 2005.  On
    March 21, 2005, however, the Department of Justice moved the charges up from
    their anticipated April 11 return date and – without any notice to the
    appellant or his counsel, and in their absence – withdrew the charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the meantime, on March 4, 2005, the appellant
    had moved for an adjournment of the extradition hearing pending the anticipated
    release the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in the <i>Ferras</i> and <i>Latty</i> cases.  Those cases raised the issue of
    the admissibility of evidence in extradition proceedings and the right of
    Canadian counsel to challenge the Record of the Case on grounds of reliability
    and credibility.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition hearing proceeded before the
    extradition judge on June 14, 15, and 21, 2005.  The appellant brought two applications at the time.  First, he requested, again, that the
    proceedings be adjourned pending the <i>Ferras</i> and <i>Latty</i> decisions.  Secondly, he requested a stay on the ground
    that the actions of the Canadian authorities amounted to an abuse of
    process.  The extradition judge denied
    both applications and committed Mr. Magnifico for extradition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “surrender” phase before the Minister of
    Justice then began.  In the course of
    that process, Mr. Greenspan made comprehensive submissions on behalf of Mr.
    Magnifico, raising all of the issues that had been canvassed during the
    extradition hearing, together with the abuse of process, s. 6(1) and other
    arguments referred to above.  On March
    30, 2006, the Minister ordered that Mr. Magnifico surrender.</p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>The Extradition Hearing</span></u></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the appeal, Mr. Greenspan did not pursue the
    point about the denied adjournment pending the <i>Ferras</i> and <i>Latty</i> decisions.  Instead, he focused on his
    argument that the extradition judge erred in refusing to stay the proceedings
    on abuse of process grounds.  In this
    respect, his principle submissions were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) that the
    Canadian charges were a ruse, and that the Canadian authorities had acted
    inappropriately in laying them as a “holding operation” only, pending the
    decision of the United States whether to seek extradition, and without any <i>bona fide</i> intention to proceed with those
    charges in Canada; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) that by
    surreptitiously moving the charges up to March 21<sup>st</sup> and withdrawing
    them in the absence of the appellant and his counsel, the Department of Justice
    improperly deprived the appellant  of the
    opportunity to ask the court to compel the Crown to proceed in Canada and –
    more significantly  – deprived him of the
    right to create a record at that hearing for purposes of making submissions to
    the Minister in the surrender process that Canada was the more appropriate
    jurisdiction for determining the charges, in accordance with the requirements
    laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in that regard in <i> United States v. Cotroni</i><b> </b>(1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 198 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge correctly noted that there
    is a “very high threshold to meet before a stay of proceedings will be
    granted”.  While an extradition judge has
    the jurisdiction to grant such a remedy, it will only be granted in the
    clearest of cases, on the basis that the prosecution “is tainted to such a
    degree that to allow it to proceed would tarnish the integrity of the court”:

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Conway</i> (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301-02 (S.C.C.).  In<i> R. v. Regan</i> (2002), 161
    C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 54, Lebel J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Regardless of whether the abuse causes
    prejudice to the accused</i>, because of an unfair trial, or to the integrity
    of the justice system, <i>a stay of
    proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria are met</i>: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be
    manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by
    its outcome; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that
    prejudice. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Court’s
    judgment in <i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 91,
    emphasized that the first criterion is critically important.  It reflects the fact that a stay of
    proceedings is a prospective rather than a retroactive remedy. A stay of
    proceedings does not merely redress a past wrong.  It aims to prevent the perpetuation of a
    wrong that, if left alone, will continue to trouble the parties and the
    community as a whole, in the future. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, he made a finding that the laying of the
    Canadian charges was not a ruse, done for an improper purpose.  I see no palpable or overriding error in that
    finding on this record, and there is therefore no basis for interfering with
    it.  There is nothing inherently wrong
    with the Crown maintaining criminal charges in Canada – assuming they are
    brought <i>bona fide</i> – until the
    Minister decides whether to authorize extradition proceedings: <i> Unites States v. Prudenza</i> (2006), 213
    C.C.C. (3d) 312 at para. 38 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Moreover, there is nothing improper about
    staying the criminal charges in favour of extradition:  <i>R v.
    Larosa</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, the Crown had ample evidence to support
    the laying of the charges.  Amongst other
    factors, the Provenzano brothers had engaged in four specific drug transactions
    involving the appellant – each for 5,000 pills of ecstasy – and were prepared
    to testify about it. There are wiretaps of the appellant’s conversations with
    them.  At the time of his arrest,
    approximately 43,000 pills were seized from a residence linked to him.  It is not as if the Canadian charges against
    him were “trumped up”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly, Mr. Greenspan’s argument that the
    appellant was deprived of a forum in the Ontario Court of Justice to probe the
    reasons surrounding the delayed extradition request and the <i>Cotroni</i> basis for proceeding in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    –
    creative as it is – cannot prevail.  While the Crown’s haste and secrecy in bringing the charges forward and
    dealing with them without notice to Mr. Greenspan or his client remains
    puzzling, I know of no authority requiring the Crown to proceed with charges it
    no longer wishes to pursue.  Mr.
    Greenspan acknowledged that he was aware of none either.  Nor is the Crown required to provide an
    explanation for withdrawal. Courts are reluctant to interfere with
    prosecutorial discretion in laying or withdrawing charges and will only do so
    in the clearest of cases: see <i>United
    States v. Leon</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I can see no basis upon which the appellant
    would have been successful in persuading a judge to compel the Crown to proceed
    with charges it no longer wished to pursue, solely for the purposes of
    exploring the Crown’s reasons for withdrawal and permitting the appellant to
    create a <i>Cotroni </i>record for purposes
    of a pending extradition hearing in another court.  Consequently, I do not see how the withdrawal
    of the Canadian charges in the Ontario Court of Justice can be said to have
    impinged upon the appellant’s right to remain in Canada pursuant to s. 6(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i> or to have been an event
    sufficiently egregious to have tainted the integrity of the extradition
    process, thus justifying a stay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is particularly so where the appellant had
    other remedies in the extradition proceedings.  The appellant could have requested a hearing before the Minister to
    attempt to vindicate his right to stay in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (an admittedly rare, but
    possible, option), but he made no such request. He could have attempted to
    persuade the extradition judge to exercise his discretion to hear evidence,
    with a view to laying the foundation for the appellant’s <i>Cotroni</i> arguments to the Minister within the parameters laid down
    in <i>United States v. Kwok</i> (2001), 152
    C.C.C. (3d) 225 at paras. 60-84 (S.C.C.).<i> </i> Finally, the appellant made full
    submissions to the Minister on the <i>Cotroni</i> factors, and the Minister took those submissions into account in making his
    surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, as the extradition judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    evidence of what Mr. Magnifico would have done had he been provided with notice
    that the Canadian charges were going to be withdrawn.  The charges had existed for some time, and
    there had been numerous court appearances.  On the face of it, Mr. Magnifico had ample opportunity to plead guilty,
    or to create a record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I can find no error in his decision not to stay
    the extradition proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>The Minister’s Surrender Decision</span></u></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister’s decision whether to surrender
    someone for extradition is primarily an exercise of executive discretion; it is
    essentially political in nature and at the extreme legislative end of the
    continuum of administrative decision making.  A surrender decision is therefore entitled to great deference, and
    courts must be “extremely cautious” to avoid undue interference in this
    area.  See <i>Schmidt v. The Queen</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 213-14 (S.C.C.); <i>Idziak v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although compacted into four factors, these
    criteria echo those adopted by LaForest J. in <i>Cotroni</i> (at 225) and are intended to provide the benchmarks for
    balancing whether the rights of the person sought under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i> would be violated by extradition
    in such circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Greenspan submits that the Minister erred in
    concluding that the appellant’s surrender was not contrary to s. 6(1) and the
    Treaty.  As noted at the outset of these
    reasons, he contends that the surrender is unjust and oppressive (a) because of
    the potentially severe penalty to which Mr. Magnifico may be subject if
    convicted in the United States, (b) because of the abuse of process referred to
    above, and (c) because there is no evidence to support the offence on which Mr.
    Magnifico is sought to be extradited. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister’s surrender letter demonstrates
    that he carefully considered all of these submissions and all of the pertinent <i>Cotroni</i> factors, s. 47(d) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, and Article 17 <i>bis</i> of the Treaty.  There was ample material in the Record to
    support his conclusion that Mr. Magnifico should be extradited to the
    <st1:country-region

    rather than be prosecuted in

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    and that this factor is relevant to the surrender analysis by virtue of s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i>: <i>Burns, supra</i>, at 126.  Mr.
    Reitz points out, however, that in at least three other narcotics-related cases
    the Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed surrender orders to the United States
    where the persons sought faced long minimum sentences: see <i>Minister of Justice v. Jamieson</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 575; <i>Ross v. United States of America</i> (1996),
    104 C.C.C. (3d) 446; and<i> United States v.

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister considered this jurisprudence and
    applied it to the appellant’s situation.  He made no error in concluding that it would not be fundamentally unjust
    to surrender the appellant on the basis of his potential exposure to a more
    severe penalty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor did he err in refusing to surrender on abuse
    of process grounds.  Mr. Greenspan made
    the same argument to the Minister as he made in this court.  I have already rejected it for the reasons
    set out above.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I do not accept the argument that there
    was no evidence to support the offences in the authority to proceed.  The appellant submits that the authority to
    proceed calls for extradition on charges of conspiracy to traffic in and to
    import ecstasy <i>into
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>, whereas all the evidence points to
    importing <i>into the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
  </i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> This
    submission is founded on a misconception of the purpose for outlining the
    proposed offence in the authority to proceed.  An authority to proceed must contain “the name of the offence or
    offences <i>under Canadian law that
    correspond to</i> the alleged conduct of the person”: <i>Extradition Act,</i> s. 15(3)(c). [Emphasis added.]  Here, the record of the case in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    proceedings alleges that the
    appellant conspired to traffic in ecstasy and to import it into the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  Thus the authority to proceed simply
    identifies – correctly – the Canadian offences mirroring the charges that the
    appellant’s alleged conduct gives rise to in the requesting state.</p>

    no abuse of process, and ample evidence to support the charges on which
    extradition is sought.  I would not
