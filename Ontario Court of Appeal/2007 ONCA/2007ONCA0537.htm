    appellant was charged with driving while impaired and driving “over 80”.  At
    the time of <span lang=EN>his arrest for drinking and driving offences, and
    again at his booking, the police informed the appellant of his right to counsel
    and to free and immediate legal advice through the Legal Aid service.  On
    both occasions, the appellant told the police that his lawyer was Anthony
    Bryant and that he was
    “not accepting anyone else”.  He had no telephone number for Mr. Bryant.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
      police searched for and obtained an office telephone number for Mr. Bryant.  They
      called the number and, when no one answered, left a message advising that
      the London Police Services was calling, that the appellant was in custody
      awaiting a breath sample and wished to speak to Mr. Bryant before doing
      so.  A number was left for Mr. Bryant to call back.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>After
      waiting approximately an hour and receiving no return call from Mr. Bryant,
      the police brought the appellant back into the cell area and told him that
      no return call had been received.  They asked the appellant whether he
      wished to call another lawyer. He declined again saying “Tony Bryant is
      my lawyer”.  The appellant was then told that if he changed his mind and
      wanted another lawyer he had only to let the police know and it would be
      arranged.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      breath tests were taken shortly thereafter during which the appellant never
      made any mention of wanting to speak with a lawyer.  Both readings were
      over 80.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>At
      trial, the appellant sought to have the results of the breathalyzer tests
      excluded on the basis that the police had violated his s. 10(b) Charter
      rights.  The trial judge dismissed the application and convicted the appellant
      of driving “over 80”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In
      so doing, the trial judge referred to the appellant’s evidence that he
      did want any lawyer other than his lawyer of choice, and that “under no
      circumstances would any other service have been appropriate”.&nbsp; Given
      that, the trial judge concluded that there would have been no point in
      the police handing him a telephone book or directing him to the Legal Aid
      list.  In these circumstances, the trial judge found that the appellant
      had not been reasonably diligent in exercising his right to counsel and
      thus no breach of his <i>Charter</i> rights had occurred.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      appeal.    </span></p>

lang=EN>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
      appellant seeks leave for a further appeal to this court.  He submits that
      the courts below erred in the analytical approach taken to the question
      of whether the appellant’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights had been violated.  We
      disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Like
      both courts below, we are of the view that this case is very similar to <i>R.
      v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Richfield </i>(2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Again, like the courts below, we rely on the reasoning in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Richfield</i>, particularly at para. 6:  a person detained by the police
    must be provided with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to counsel
    and, except in cases of urgency or danger, the police must refrain from eliciting
    evidence from the detainee until he or she has had that reasonable opportunity.&nbsp; The
    detained or arrested person who is offered the opportunity to contact counsel
    and asserts his right to a
    “particular counsel” must, however, exercise that right diligently.&nbsp;  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>While
      a</span>n accused person has a right to his or her counsel of choice, that
      right is not absolute<span lang=EN>.  </span>If the lawyer chosen is not
      available within a reasonable amount of time, the accused person will be
      expected to exercise the right to counsel by calling a different lawyer:

    <i>Richfield</i>, para. 7.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
      appellant had the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities that his
      s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights had been violated.&nbsp; The appellant’s
      onus was to prove that his right to retain and instruct counsel without
      delay, and to be informed of that right, was breached.  In discharging
      that </span>onus, the appellant had to prove as well that he acted with
      reasonable diligence in the exercise of his right to choose counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    findings of the trial judge, as confirmed by the summary conviction appeal
    judge, are solidly grounded in the evidence:  the appellant did not make
    reasonably diligent efforts in exercising his right to counsel.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Here,
      t</span>he police informed the appellant about Legal Aid duty counsel,
      they attempted to contact his counsel of choice and they repeatedly offered
      to contact a different lawyer if he changed his mind.  The appellant refused
      all these efforts insisting that he would only speak with his counsel of
      choice.  In this context, including the findings of the trial judge that
      the police discharged their duty, the appellant did not prove that he acted
      with reasonable diligence or that his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights had
      been violated.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the circumstances of this case and in view of the findings of the trial judge,
    the discrete issue of waiver of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights does
    not arise.  We also observe that the issue of waiver was never raised at
    trial or on the summary conviction appeal.  It was raised for the first time
    on this appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of our conclusion on the issue of reasonable diligence, it is unnecessary
    to address s. 24 (2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    courts below committed no error.  Accordingly, while leave to appeal is granted,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
