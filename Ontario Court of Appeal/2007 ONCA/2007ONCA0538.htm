    was fine for the first few months after reconciliation.  The complainant
    testified that after those first few months, the appellant began to threaten
    and assault her.  In May 2004, the family moved into a home that had been
    bought by the appellant.  The complainant testified that she stayed with
    the appellant because she was frightened of him and frightened to leave the
    relationship.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises three arguments on the conviction appeal.  The first is
    that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of discreditable conduct
    on the part of the appellant that did not form part of the allegations in
    the indictment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge committed no error in respect of the evidence of
    discreditable conduct on the part of the appellant.  Crown counsel submitted
    that the evidence was admissible as part of the narrative to understand why
    the complainant had not left the appellant and delayed in reporting some
    of the conduct charged.  The trial judge accepted that submission and admitted
    the evidence as part of the narrative.  In the circumstances, the trial judge
    was not obliged to conduct a <i>voir dire</i> regarding the admissibility
    of the evidence.  The evidence was relevant and important in understanding
    the relationship between the parties, the context within which the alleged
    abuse occurred, the appellant’s animus towards the complainant and why the
    complainant failed to leave the relationship earlier than she did.  Its probative
    value outweighed its prejudicial effect.  We note that defence counsel made
    no objection to the admission of this evidence.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second argument raised on appeal is that the trial judge used the evidence
    of discreditable conduct in an improper manner.  Read in the context of the
    trial judge’s reasons as a whole, we do not understand the trial judge to
    have engaged in impermissible propensity reasoning.  He used the evidence
    of discreditable conduct as part of his assessment of the appellant’s credibility
    and to reject the argument that the appellant was not the person he had portrayed
    himself to be in his evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence concerning the two incidents
    because he found it to be “inconsistent, contradictory, evasive, exaggerated
    and false”. Although the trial judge did not frame it as such, he was following
    the first branch of <i>(W.)D</i>. and explaining why he did not believe the
    appellant’s evidence.  The impugned paragraphs that followed are the application
    of the second and third steps of <i>(W)D</i>:  that is, the trial judge explained
    why the evidence which he did accept convinced him beyond a reasonable doubt
    of the appellant’s guilt.  He did not reverse the burden of proof or hold
    the appellant to a higher standard than the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) was neither argued nor addressed below.  In the circumstances, we need
    not address its applicability here. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third argument is that the trial judge erred in finding that the pellet gun
    was a firearm.  The appellant testified that the pellet gun was an “air pellet
    pistol”.  In <i>R v. Covin</i>, [1983] 1 SCR 725, the Supreme Court of Canada
    held that an air pistol is a firearm because it is capable of causing bodily
    injury.  On the evidence before the trial judge, including that of the appellant
    that the gun was loaded and operable and that it could hurt and possibly
    kill him, the trial judge was entitled to find that it was a firearm within
    the meaning of s.&nbsp;2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal against convictions is, therefore, dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in not imposing a conditional sentence and in holding that a “real
    jail sentence” was required.  We see no merit in this ground of appeal.  Viewed
    cumulatively, the appellant’s conduct in fracturing the complainant’s collar
    bone, threatening to kill her while holding an air pistol to her head and
    his abusive conduct towards her over a sustained period of time, may well
    have merited a penitentiary sentence.  The Crown has not, however, cross-appealed
    the sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the imposition of an 18-month conditional sentence
    in addition to the intermittent sentence rendered the intermittent sentence
    unlawful, as the appellant’s global sentence would exceed the maximum 90
    days prescribed by s. 732 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    732(3) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>732.  (3)  Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment
    on a person who is subject to an intermittent sentence in respect of another
    offence, the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence shall be served
    on consecutive days unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept that the sentence imposed was
    “unlawful”.  However, in our view, s. 732(3) does apply.  At the time that
    the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment by means of the conditional
    sentence for uttering a threat and pointing a firearm, he had already sentenced
    the appellant to the intermittent sentence for assault causing bodily harm.  Section
    732(3) has the effect of causing the unexpired portion of the intermittent
    sentence, which was the full 90 days, to be served on consecutive days.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentence, as imposed, was intended to cause the appellant to serve “real
    jail time” but without loss of employment and consequent support for the
    child.  No one contends that the sentence was unfit or unreasonable although
    the Crown argues that it is lenient.  In our view, although the effect of
    s.&nbsp;732(3) was unintended, given the nature of the offences, we would
    do nothing to disturb its effect. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would grant leave to appeal the sentence but dismiss the appeal.  For
    the sake of clarity, we reiterate that as a consequence of the operation
    of s. 732(3), the 90-day term of imprisonment is to be served on consecutive
    days and the balance of the sentence remains unchanged.  </p>
