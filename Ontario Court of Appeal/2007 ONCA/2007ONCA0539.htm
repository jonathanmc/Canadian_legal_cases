    March 27, 2006, the motion judge, Nevins J. of the Ontario Court of Justice,
    set aside the <i>ex-parte</i> order on the basis that it had been obtained
    by means of false information, namely, an affidavit filed by the wife in
    which she stated that the child was habitually resident in Canada. Nonetheless,
    after a full hearing that lasted several days and included a mass of affidavit
    evidence, he accepted jurisdiction over the child to determine matters of
    custody and access under s. 23 of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C. 12 (<i>CLRA</i>). He did so after finding that the child would

  <p>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the motion judge err in fact and law in concluding that the husband had physically

  <p>(2)<span

    the motion judge err in fact and law in concluding that there was a reasonable
    likelihood that the violence and abuse to which the wife had been exposed
    would continue if she and child returned to Dubai, and that she and the child
    would not be adequately protected from it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband submits that both of the alleged errors are significant and that
    if we find merit in either one, we should set aside Nevins J.’s order, declare
    that Ontario does not have jurisdiction to determine matters of custody and
    access relating to the child, and order that the child be returned to Dubai
    forthwith. Alternatively, he submits that we should remit the matter to the
    Ontario Court of Justice for the “trial of an issue” under s.&nbsp;23 of

    J. considered the motion judge’s careful review and analysis of the evidence
    on this issue and concluded that he correctly interpreted and applied the
    appropriate legal test and standard of proof under s. 23.  I agree with her
    analysis and conclusion and would simply add the following observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge gave detailed and comprehensive reasons for concluding that
    there was “a significant degree of violence, physical and verbal, oral and
    written, directed by the [husband] to the [wife]”
    and … that “the child was exposed to this, in the sense that he was in the
    environment”. He further found that while the evidence was not overwhelming,
    there was “a significant amount of evidence” that justified “a finding on
    the balance of probabilities that the situation was violent and put the child
    in an intolerable situation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it was open to the motion judge to make those findings. In doing
    so, I am satisfied that he applied the correct standard of proof and took
    into account and weighed the pertinent evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    his reasons disclose, the motion judge was very much alive to the frailties
    in the wife’s evidence and he properly sought out confirmatory evidence before
    relying on it to find that she had been victimized, both physically and mentally,
    by the husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the husband’s submission, I am satisfied that the confirmatory evidence
    relied upon by the motion judge was sufficiently cogent to restore his faith
    in the wife’s evidence, such that he could safely act on it to make the findings
    of abuse on a balance of probabilities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of illustration, relatives in Toronto attested to the husband’s abusive
    and dominant character, and a woman from Dubai confirmed the wife’s evidence
    about an occasion in Dubai when the wife was assaulted by her husband and
    the police were called. The wife also filed photographs showing her injuries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, there were two significant e-mails from the husband that provided
    compelling confirmatory evidence regarding two incidents of assault that
    the wife was able to recall in detail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first of these incidents occurred in April or May of 2003. According to the
    wife, the husband physically assaulted her and in the course of the attack,
    he bit her on the left shoulder with such intensity that he left a bite mark
    and a scar that remained visible for several years. In respect of this incident,
    to which the police were called, the husband wrote to the wife as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I want to reconfirm
    my sorrow and shame for what happened on the night of Tuesday/Wednesday May
    13/14, 2003. It is up to you to accept my apology or refuse it. My feelings
    of sorrow stand for the fact that you – my wife – are emotionally and physically
    harmed....regardless of your intention to forgive me or not, to continue
    the police and court case or not, and to continue our marriage or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge noted, the content of that e-mail amounted to an admission
    of fault for which the husband apologized and sought forgiveness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second incident involved an assault on the wife that occurred on April 11,
    2005, after she and the husband had separated and days before she left for
    Canada. The police were also called to this incident. Of note, the wife and
    her friend, who was with her at the time, stated that on this occasion the
    police paid no attention to the wife and communicated only with the husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an e-mail sent by the husband to the wife on April 29, 2005, the husband
    stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>BUT TO MAKE
    IT CLEAR:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>I am ONLY dangerous if someone ATTACKS me dangerously.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>But that applies not only to ME, but to almost EVERY HUMAN BEING.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>To me, that applies for example to April 11, after your dangerous
    invasion of my privacy, and your dangerous abuse of [the child] as a shield
    to protect you during that invasion. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>And yes, I will remain a dangerous DEFENDANT of my privacy,
    my legal rights, my pride, my dignity. IF someone on Earth wants to have
    peace, he/she should AVOID HARMING ME. The message is simple and clear, and
    every man on Earth would repeat it: Don’t harm me, and I will remain a peaceful
    man towards you. But if you harm me, I may become a dangerous defendant of
    myself against that harm. Take that to any police station, and they will
    understand it. Take it to any court, and they will approve it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>BUT YOU SAY:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>“Remember NO matter what people do; it’s no excuse for you to
    lose control and yell at them, and punish them physically,” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>WRONG, I DISAGREE: “No matter what people do?” No!. I am not
    Jesus Christ. There was only ONE Christ (otherwise he would be jealous to
    have a SECOND competitor!).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If someone attacks
    me, I will attack back. If there is no immediate punishment on the spot,
    bad people like you would continue to harm others who left them in peace.
    Verbal insult against me is an ATTACK. Invading my privacy is an attack.
    Abusing my son as a shield in that invasion is an attack.  Every attack must
    be punished immediately, so that it STOPS immediately. Because Police and
    Courts need some time to stop it, the damage would be more severe if I wait
    for them and do not punish attackers on the spot, to stop them from extending
    the attack.” [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge quite properly found the content of that e-mail to be “very
    concerning and upsetting”. Not only did the e-mail confirm the husband’s
    violence towards the wife on the occasion in question; it also showed him
    to be a man who was controlling and dominating and willing to resort to violence
    at the slightest provocation.</p>

    the motion judge found that the situation in the household was violent and
    put the child in “an intolerable situation and exposes him to serious harm”.  He
    also found that the child was very aggressive and, while he could not with
    certainty determine the cause of this behaviour, it supported the wife’s
    position that it was caused by exposure to the domestic violence.</p>

    the husband. Contrary to the husband’s submission, I am not persuaded that
    the motion judge either misapprehended material evidence or failed to consider
    it. As this court has pointed out on numerous occasions, he was not required
    to recount every piece of evidence or resolve every conflict in the evidence.</p>

    wife had been the victim of physical and mental abuse at the hands of her

      issue is somewhat more troublesome. Central to it is the husband’s contention
      that the motion judge erred in admitting and relying upon a report prepared
      by Amnesty International, released May 11, 2005, concerning discrimination
      and violence against women in the Gulf Cooperation Countries, including

      motion judge admitted the Amnesty International Report over the husband’s
      objection. In his reasons for judgment, he stated at one point that because
      the Report stood “uncontradicted”, he could “give weight [to it] insofar
      as it proves there is reason to be concerned about the degree of access
      to justice that a woman in general, and a married woman in particular,
      would have in that part of the world where there is a concern over domestic
      violence or domestic abuse”. Elsewhere in his reasons, the motion judge
      stated that the Report “can and should be given a considerable amount of
      weight”. In the penultimate paragraph of his decision, he held that the
      Report should be given “a fair bit of weight”, along with other evidence,
      in concluding that “if returned to Dubai, there is a reasonable likelihood
      that the violence and the abuse to which [the wife] has been exposed would
      continue and that she would not be adequately protected from it, and most
      certainly, the child would not be adequately protected from it”. </span></p>

      its face, the Report did not purport to be a study devoted to the problems
      of violence and discrimination against women in Dubai, nor did it specifically
      address the inadequacies of the Dubai justice system in counteracting these
      forces. Indeed, as the husband points out, the Report was not even specific
      to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), of which
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Dubai is but one member; rather, it related to a host of countries in the
    region, including

      reviewing the sixty-five page Report, it is noteworthy that the UAE is
      only referred to on a handful of occasions and Dubai is mentioned only
      twice. More to the point, the Report does not record a single instance
      of domestic assault in Dubai that state authorities failed to address.
      Only one of the women interviewed by the Amnesty International team was
      from Dubai, and her story of discrimination involved an entirely unrelated
      matter (i.e. her inability to marry without her father’s consent). </span></p>

      2005 incident. Perhaps as well, the Report could have been used, again

      to the position of the wife, I do not accept that the rules relating to
      evidence on motions under the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg.114/99, assist
      on this issue. Although those rules may relieve against certain evidentiary
      hurdles, they do not allow for the admission of evidence of marginal relevance

      my conclusion that the Report was otherwise inadmissible, I need not finally
      resolve the hearsay issue. I would simply point out that where a document
      like the Amnesty International Report is being tendered for the truth of
      its contents in respect of contested facts (be they adjudicative, legislative
      or social) that are at the centre of the controversy between the parties,
      the reliability and trustworthiness of the document takes on added importance. </span>To
      that end, I believe that trial and motion judges should be guided by the
      principles set forth by Binnie J. in <i>R. v. Spence</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C.
      (3d) 1 at paras. 60-61. Although Binnie J.’s comments were directed to
      the issue of judicial notice, I believe that they are apposite to situations
      like the one at hand.  Thus, in this case, the closer the Amnesty International
      Report came to the dispositive issue, namely, whether the wife and child
      would be adequately protected by the Dubai justice system, the closer scrutiny
      it deserved.</p>

    that could well have translated into a need to submit evidence from witnesses
    with firsthand knowledge of the Report who could be subject to meaningful
    cross-examination.  No such witnesses were available here.  The Report was
    appended to the affidavit of Mr. Robert Alexander Neve, Secretary-General
    of Amnesty International, Canadian Section.  As is apparent from Mr. Neve’s
    affidavit, he did not participate directly in the drafting of the Report;
    hence, he could only attest to the fact that it had been prepared “in conformity
    with Amnesty International’s exacting quality control standards”.  </p>

      choosing instead to communicate only with the husband. Moreover, there

      his dominant and controlling behaviour, and a court order from Dubai requiring
