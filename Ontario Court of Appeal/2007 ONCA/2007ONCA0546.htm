    a ten-week jury trial, the appellant was convicted of break and enter and
    commission of sexual assault, forcible confinement, and dangerous operation
    of a motor vehicle.  All offences occurred within a single day and all involved
    the same complainant, the appellant’s former girlfriend.  After a lengthy

    to ten years imprisonment, to be followed by the maximum period of ten years

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    my conclusion that a new trial is required on the ground that the trial judge
    departed from the required procedure for selecting the triers for the challenge
    for cause, I offer here only a brief summary of the facts giving rise to
    the convictions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial consisted essentially of two conflicting accounts of the
    events following the termination of a romantic relationship between the appellant
    and the complainant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant and the appellant first met in September 1999, when the appellant
    was on parole and residing in a halfway house and working at a distributing
    company.  The complainant was living at the home of her mother and step-father
    and working at a strip club.  They dated steadily for five or six months
    with periods of break up and reconciliation.  In March 2000, the appellant
    was arrested, his day parole was revoked and he was returned to the penitentiary
    for eight weeks.  The charges leading to the revocation of his parole were
    later withdrawn and the individual who made the allegations was charged with
    mischief and perjury.  The appellant’s re-incarceration led to the termination
    of their romantic relationship.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s parole was reinstated and he returned to the halfway house on
    May 18, 2000.  Between May 18 and May 29 the appellant and the complainant
    met at various times to exchange personal property.  While they gave divergent
    accounts of their relationship during this period, it is common ground that
    they spent May 23 at a motel having consensual sex. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the morning of May 29, the complainant testified that the appellant entered
    her home and sexually assaulted her.  The appellant taunted the complainant
    about her new boyfriend and told her that he had her boyfriend locked in
    the trunk of his car.  The complainant testified that following the assault,
    which lasted five to ten minutes, she tried to calm the appellant down.  She
    told the appellant that her step-father would be returning to the house and
    that they should leave.  After about an hour and a half, they drove in separate
    cars to a coffee shop.  According to the complainant, the appellant went
    in and got her a coffee.  They sat in her car talking about the appellant’s
    problems and then, at her suggestion, went to a pay phone to call the appellant’s
    mother, who did not answer. When she returned to her car, the appellant became
    aggressive and she drove off.  The appellant followed her in his car and,
    according to the complainant, he bumped her car several times and tried to
    force her car into oncoming traffic. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified that while she was driving away from the appellant,
    she used her cell phone to call her new boyfriend.  The call lasted for approximately
    thirty seconds.  She then made a 911 call narrating the car chase as well
    as the break-in and sexual assault that had occurred earlier in the morning.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified and denied these allegations.  He denied being at the
    complainant’s home that morning but testified that the two had agreed to
    meet at the coffee shop to exchange personal property.  He swore that the
    complainant became upset and left.  The appellant called alibi evidence as
    to his whereabouts on the morning of May 29 and he denied other allegations
    made by the complainant, including that he had stalked her and her boyfriend
    during the days leading up to May 29.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h4>Jury selection</h4>
  <p><i>1.         The procedure employed in this case</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge clearly departed from the statutorily mandated procedure for
    selecting the triers of the challenge for cause.  After the initial triers
    were replaced as triers by the first two jurors chosen, the trial judge decided
    to continue with those same triers for the balance of the jury selection
    process rather than replace them in turn as new jurors were selected, as
    required by s. 640(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>640(2)  Where
    the ground of a challenge is one not mentioned in subsection (1), <i>the
    two jurors who were last sworn</i>, or if no jurors have then been sworn,
    two persons present whom the court may appoint for the purpose, <i>shall
    be sworn to</i> <i>determine whether the ground of challenge is true</i>.

    aspects of the jury selection procedure are directory in nature.  Parliament
    has recognized this in s. 643(3) by describing the procedures outlined in
    ss. 631, 635, 641 and 643 as being “directions” and stating that the failure
    to comply with such directions “does not affect the validity of a proceeding.”  It
    is significant that Parliament excluded s.&nbsp;640 from the list of sections

    is also the case that trial judges must be afforded some latitude or discretion
    where the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not specifically address the issue.  For
    example, in <i>R. v. Brown</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 570, this court held,
    at paras. 17-19, that it is “preferable” to replace one of the initial triers
    with the first juror sworn rather than wait to replace both initial triers
    until two jurors have been sworn.  Similarly, in <i>R. v. Gayle</i> (2001),
    154 C.C.C. (3d) 221, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (2001) 160 O.A.C.
    199, this court rejected the contention that the trial judge erred by excusing
    a potential juror when the two triers could not agree on whether the prospective
    juror was partial given the permissive language of ss. 632 and s. 640(4).</p>

    the other hand, trial judges have no inherent authority to modify the codified

    v. Gayle, supra</i>, at para. 53, this court stated: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It goes without
    saying that the statutory provisions governing jury selection must be followed,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>686 (1) On the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent argues that as each challenge for cause was decided by two jurors,
    the spirit, if not the letter, of s. 640(2) was followed.  The respondent
    submits that the failure to follow the dictates of s. 640(2) was a minor
    procedural irregularity to which the appellant consented and which caused
    the appellant no prejudice as it cannot be demonstrated that if the proper
    procedure had been followed, different jurors would have been selected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    am unable to accept the respondent’s submission that s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv)
    is capable of curing the error at issue on this appeal.  In my view, the
    trial judge’s failure to follow s.&nbsp;640(2) cannot be described as a minor
    procedural irregularity.  Parliament expressly directed that jurors are to
    act as triers on the challenge for cause in a rotating fashion. That statutorily
    mandated procedure specifically assigns jurisdiction to decide the important
    issue of the impartiality of each prospective juror to a new combination
    of triers.  By requiring that the triers rotate, s. 640(2) has the effect
    of ensuring, to the maximum extent possible, that the responsibility for
    determining the challenge for cause is shared by all jurors but the last
    juror selected.  By spreading the authority to decide the challenge for cause
    in this manner, s. 640(2) guarantees that a variety of views and perspectives
    will be brought to bear on the fundamental question of how the jury is to
    be constituted.  In my view, a departure from this carefully constructed
    scheme for deciding who shall sit in judgment of the accused cannot be described
    as a minor procedural defect, nor is it an error that can be cured by applying
    s. 686(1)(b)(iv) as that section has been interpreted by this court and by
    the Supreme Court of Canada.  The court that tried and convicted the appellant
    was improperly constituted.  As the trial court never had jurisdiction to
    try the appellant, s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) has no application.</p>

      Arbour J. noted, at para. 12, this provision was enacted to extend the
      curative proviso “to put an end to the jurisprudence holding that procedural
      errors having caused a loss of jurisdiction in the trial courts could not
      be cured, even on appeal” and, at para. 13, to overcome a body of case
      law “replete with complex decisions distinguishing between the various
      jurisdictional consequences of procedural errors both pre-trial, at trial
      and post-conviction.”
     The list included such issues as whether a limitation defence in a summary
    conviction went to jurisdiction, issues of territorial jurisdiction and challenges
    to the form of the indictment.  While Arbour J. included in her list, at
    para. 14, “irregularities in jury selection” as an example of the “procedural
    irregularities which were said to be of a jurisdictional nature” she cited,
    without any expression of disapproval, <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41
    C.C.C. (3d) 1, a decision of this court made after the proviso was amended
    to extend to jurisdictional errors.  As I will explain, <i>Rowbotham</i> held
    that certain errors in the jury selection process were not amenable to cure

      J. summarized the scope of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) at para. 16:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

      enacted in the face of a body of case law that was becoming increasingly
      technical and complex and which had restricted considerably the possibility
      for appellate courts to conclude that an error at trial was not such that
      it required a setting aside of the verdict. This provision is rarely invoked,
      because procedural irregularities that result from an error of law, which
      is most of them, are properly dealt with under s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)
      of the <i>Code</i>. Prior to the enactment of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) in
      1985, some procedural irregularities, although they amounted to errors
      of law, had been ruled “jurisdictional” and courts had decided that they
      could therefore not be cured by the proviso since jurisdiction had been
      lost. In that context it is clear that the new provision was not meant
      to deal with trivial procedural irregularities which in any event would
      have been curable under the proviso as long as they constituted errors
      of law. I agree with Goodman J.A. in <i>Cloutier</i> [<i>supra</i>] that
      s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) was enacted to cure serious procedural irregularities,
      otherwise amounting to errors of law, in cases where under the then existing
      case law, jurisdiction over the person, but not over the offence, had been
      lost. I also agree with Goodman J.A. that under this new subparagraph,
      since the procedural irregularities in issue would have been serious ones,
      it is appropriate to infer prejudice without requiring in every case that
      the accused demonstrate prejudice. The inference may of course be rebutted
      and the test of prejudice under that subsection should be the same as the
      no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, under s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii),
      which has been the subject of extensive pronouncement by this Court.</span></p>

    to be “fatal to the jurisdiction of the court” and that it “cannot be cured
    by invoking s. 613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv).”</p>

    reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue of whether the Crown’s
    right to stand aside violated the accused s. 11(<i>d</i>) <i>Charter</i> right
    to a fair trial. As a result, the two majority judgments (<i>per </i><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Cory
    J., Lamer C.J. and La Forest J. concurring; Stevenson J.) did not consider
    the application of the curative proviso. The dissenting judgment, written
    by Gonthier J. (McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. concurring) would have rejected
    the <i>Charter</i> challenge to the Crown’s right to stand aside jurors and
    accordingly had to consider the application of the proviso.  Gonthier J.
    agreed with this court’s reasoning that the defect was fundamental to the
    jurisdiction of the court and that it could not be cured.  He found, at pp.
    509-510, that this court had rightly distinguished <i>Cloutier</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Section
      686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) speaks of a “trial court”.  A trial court, for indictable
      offences, is defined at s. 471 of the <i>Code</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN>471. Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, every accused
      who is charged with an indictable offence shall be tried by a court composed
      of a judge and jury.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>This
      definition is repeated in s. 536(2) of the <i>Code</i>, in the address
      to the accused for his election.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>As
      can be seen from s. 471 of the <i>Code</i>, a jury is more than an incident
      or a procedural tool in a trial case. The jury is the court, together with
      the trial judge. If the jury is not constituted according to the rules,
      the court exists no more than if the judge had been unlawfully appointed.
      In the case at bar, the problem is not one of application of the jury selection
      rules, which could have been saved by s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) of the <i>Code</i>.
      The rules were changed. <i>The jury was selected pursuant to other rules
      than those set out in the </i>Code<i>. There was therefore no trial court
      properly constituted, and the appropriate sanction is annulment.</i></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN>This holding does not detract from the classification proposed
      in <i>Cloutier</i>, <i>supra</i>. In order for the saving provisions of
      s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) of the <i>Code</i> to find application, not only
      must the court have jurisdiction over the class of offence, but it must
      also be a court within the meaning of the <i>Code</i>. Any failure with
      respect to these conditions constitutes an error falling in the first category
      outlined in <i>Cloutier</i>, <i>supra</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    this is a dissenting judgment, Gonthier J. was not dissenting on this point.
    As I have noted, the majority expressed no opinion on this issue as it decided
    the case on other grounds. Moreover, Gonthier J.’s analysis of the reach
    of <i>Cloutier</i> and s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) was expressly adopted
    by Arbour J., writing for the majority, in <i>R. v. Kahn</i>,<i> supra</i>,
    at para. 11. </p>

    note that this conclusion is not at odds with <i>R. v. Brown</i> (2005),
    194 C.C.C. (3d) 76, where this court held that the trial judge erred by giving
    both the Crown and the accused an additional peremptory challenge when a
    sworn juror had to be replaced during the jury selection process, but that
    this error caused no prejudice to the accused who had actually used the additional
    challenge.  No reference was made to s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) and as the error
    worked to the advantage of the accused, it is difficult to see how it could
    provide the basis for a successful ground of appeal.</p>

    view the error at issue here as being at least as serious as those in <i>Rowbotham</i> and <i>Bain</i> and
    to fall into the category that fatally infects the jurisdiction of the court
    the try the accused.  The impartiality of nine members of the jury was not
    assessed in the manner prescribed by the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The <i>Code</i> assigned
    certain individuals the responsibility for making that decision to ensure
    a fair trial before an impartial jury.  To “expedite” the selection of the
    jury, the trial judge erroneously assigned that very responsibility to someone
    else.  He had no authority to do so and, as a result, the jury was not properly
    constituted.  On the authority of the decisions of this court in <i>Rowbotham</i> and <i>Bain</i>,
    approved by <span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>Gonthier J. in the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Bain</i>,
    in turn approved of by Arbour J. in <i>Khan</i>, the curative proviso in
    s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) of the <i>Code</i> has no application to this appeal.</span></p>

    I have concluded that the conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered,
    it is neither necessary nor desirable for me to deal with the additional
    issues raised by the appellant.  While the other issues were fully argued,
    it is my view that they are best left to the trial judge to resolve on the
    basis of the evidence presented at the new trial.  The question of the admissibility
    of the 911 call as part of the <i>res gestae,</i> as well as the issue of
    the alleged waiver of the appellant’s s. 10(<i>b</i>) rights, both fall to
    be determined on relatively well-settled legal principles.  In both instances,
    the more difficult question is to assess the evidence and to decide which
    side of the line it falls on. In both instances, the trial judge ruled in
    favour of the Crown, but as I would allow the appeal, it goes without saying
    that I certainly do not consider his rulings to be in any way binding at
    the new trial.  Similarly, the issues of the instruction as to credibility
    and the <i>Corbett</i> ruling are matters best left to the judge at the new
    trial to resolve in light of the evidence as it unfolds at the new trial.  Finally,
    as I would allow the conviction appeal, it is unnecessary to deal with the
    issues raised as to sentence.</p>
