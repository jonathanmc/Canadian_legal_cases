  <h2>I.          Overview </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 3, 2004, Nicholas J. of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario Court of Justice declared the respondent, Gary Little, a long-term
    offender and sentenced him to a ten-year term of imprisonment, without credit
    for two years and five months pre-trial custody, to be followed by a ten-year
    supervision order.  A lifetime weapons prohibition was also imposed.  The
    Crown appeals the long-term offender designation and seeks to have Little
    declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence
    of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Little
    suffers from an antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality
    traits and an alcohol abuse disorder.  He has also been diagnosed as a psychopath,
    who has a history of controlling and manipulating his female domestic partners
    by threatening or engaging in violent behaviour and supplying them with alcohol
    or street drugs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    August 2002, Little was convicted of assault, assault with a weapon (a tire
    iron), possession of a weapon (a baseball bat) for a purpose dangerous to
    the public peace, forcible entry, possession of a weapon (a tire iron) for
    a purpose dangerous to the public peace, uttering threats, break and enter,
    and two counts of mischief in relation to incidents involving his former
    girlfriend, K.M., and her boyfriend, J.C., that occurred on October 7, 2001.  These
    convictions constituted the predicate offences underlying the Crown’s dangerous
    offender application.  Little’s appeal from his convictions on the first
    three charges was dismissed by this court on April 11, 2007: [2007] O.J.
    No. 1467.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that Little meets the statutory criteria under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 for both dangerous offender and long-term
    offender desig-nations.  She accepted the uncontradicted psychiatric evidence
    at the dangerous offender hearing that: (i) Little’s risk of violently reoffending
    was “extremely high, and perhaps a virtual certainty, for the next 10 years”;
    (ii) he “poses an unacceptable risk to cause serious personal injury during
    that 10 year period”; and (iii) “he will almost certain[ly] recidivate violently
    if released to the community”
    prior to age forty-five.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    psychiatric evidence further established that those persons most at risk
    of future violent offending by Little are vulnerable, needy, dependent females
    and that, with or without treatment, Little will not experience any fundamental
    change in his personality.  To the contrary, he will continue to target vulnerable
    women as partners in the future.  The trial judge termed Little “the worst
    partner abuser that I have seen in 13 years, where death has not resulted”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    because of the anticipated impact of the aging process on Little’s criminality,
    and because the evidence suggested that he had never previously been subject
    to strict conditions while on probation or parole, the trial judge concluded
    that a reasonable possibility of eventual control of Little’s risk in the
    community, after he attains the age of forty-five, exists.  She therefore
    dismissed the Crown’s dangerous offender application, declared Little to
    be a long-term offender, and imposed a long-term supervision order of ten
    years with strict conditions attached.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that the trial judge erred by failing to declare Little a dangerous
    offender.  It makes three principal submissions in support of this argument.  First,
    it contends that the trial judge misinterpreted both the long-term offender
    provisions in the <i>Code</i> and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Johnson</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 97, by failing to
    impose an indeterminate sentence in the absence of evidence that Little could
    be cured or rehabilitated within a determinate period of time.  Second, the
    Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the likelihood
    of a reduction in Little’s risk of violent recidivism as a result of the
    aging process (the “burn-out” theory).  Finally, the Crown maintains that
    the trial judge’s designation of Little as a long-term offender is unsustainable
    because the evidence at the dangerous offender hearing demonstrated the impossibility
    of giving effect to many of the key supervisory conditions that the trial
    judge concluded were necessary to control Little’s risk in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the following reasons, I would allow the appeal.  In my opinion, in the circumstances
    of this case, the trial judge erred by declaring Little a long-term offender
    and imposing a determinate sentence in the absence of evidence either that
    Little could be meaningfully treated within a definite period of time, or
    that the resources needed to implement the supervision conditions that the
    trial judge concluded were necessary to eventually control Little’s risk
    in the community were available, so as to bring Little’s risk of future reoffending
    within tolerable limits.  </p>
  <h2>II.        Facts</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       Little’s Criminal History </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Little
    has a long history of violent criminal behaviour.  His criminal record, dating
    from 1985, consists of twenty-five entries, at least ten of which involve
    crimes of violence against his domestic partners and others.  Many of these
    offences involved the use or supply of alcohol or drugs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Little
    committed several serious acts of violence prior to the predicate offences.  These
    included assault and uttering death threats against his then girlfriend in
    1994 and 1995 and, approximately two years later, forcible entry into the
    apartment of his subsequent girlfriend, K.M., whom he threatened and detained
    for two hours until she escaped to a neighbour’s apartment.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in March 1998, Little physically, sexually and verbally assaulted
    K.M. after she refused to have sex with him.  K.M. sustained various injuries,
    including two finger fractures, extensive bruising to her body, a welt or
    burn-like injury on about one-half of her back, and leg lacerations.  When
    the police arrived, they observed Little curse at and kick K.M.  An officer
    sustained a hand injury when he tried to intervene.  Little was convicted
    of assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault, assault and assaulting a
    peace officer in respect of this incident.  He was sentenced to three hundred
    and seventy&#8209;six days’ imprisonment and eighteen months probation for
    these offences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the same day that he was convicted for the March 1998 attack, Little again
    assaulted K.M., punching and kicking her repeatedly while wearing steel-toed
    construction boots.  K.M.’s resulting injuries included extensive bruising,
    swelling of her face and scalp, and the rupture of an eardrum.  Little was
    convicted of aggravated assault and attempting to obstruct justice and sentenced
    to three years’ imprisonment in addition to four and one-half months’ pre-trial
    custody in respect of this incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the time that Little was released from custody, K.M. was involved in a new
    relationship with J.C.  Little would not accept this and persisted in attempts
    to resume a relationship with K.M.  He committed the predicate offences within
    four months of his release from custody, while on parole.  During the same
    period, he repeatedly breached the conditions of his parole that precluded
    contact with K.M. and the use of alcohol and drugs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    predicate offences were committed on October 7, 2001, when Little engaged
    in a series of violent acts against K.M. and J.C.  During the afternoon,
    he attended at K.M.’s apartment unannounced, accompanied by others and armed
    with a baseball bat, and tried to force his way into the apartment.  In the
    process, he threatened J.C., who was observing him through a peephole in
    the door of the apartment.  Several hours later, K.M. discovered Little attempting
    to enter the front door of her apartment building.  Against K.M.’s vigorous
    objections, Little, in a state of rage, forced his way into the building.  A
    struggle ensued as Little proceeded to K.M.’s apartment, pushing K.M. and
    pulling her hair enroute.  Little then kicked, hit and swung a tire iron
    at K.M.’s apartment door.  J.C., who was in the apartment, called the police.  At
    some point before the police arrived, Little hit K.M. on the leg with the
    tire iron.  He subsequently fled down the apartment stairs where the police
    ultimately apprehended him.</p>

    the CAMH report, Dr. Klassen stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Little] has presented as glib and as having considerable
    verbal facility.  He evidences a positive self-percept, and even presents
    as quite grandiose at times; this suggests that… [Little] likely has little
    underlying motivation to engage in self-change.  He has been duplicitous.  There
    has been no substantial or sustained demonstration of remorse, a sense of
    guilt, or empathy; the best arbiter of same is engagement in behavioural
    change, and this has certainly been lacking.  He has continued to engage
    in non-conforming behaviour, insofar as his performance on conditional release
    has been poor.  His behavioural controls, in the absence of alcohol, do seem
    to have been much better than in the presence of alcohol; this gentleman
    presents as markedly volatile, when intoxicated.  He has manifested a substantial
    failure to take responsibility for his behaviour, and he variously blames
    alcohol, his victims, his peers, the correctional system, the justice system,
    and the medical system, for his difficulties or failures.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find particularly troubling the fact that this
    individual has demonstrated no substantial change in values or attitudes,
    even after having been described as performing very well in treatment; this
    suggests to me that [Little]…essentially engaged in programming to be able
    to learn the language, in the service of securing his release…this individual
    is likely, given his intelligence and his verbal skills, a capable manipulator
    of others’ opinions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen testified that Little presented “at very high risk of future violent
    recidivism”.  He scored thirty-five, out of a possible score of forty, on
    the Psychopathy Checklist-Revisited (PCL-R) test, which is used to measure
    risk of criminal recidivism.  Dr. Klassen explained that “individuals with
    scores of 25 or greater are particularly problematic in terms of recidivism,
    and difficulties with response to community supervision and/or treatment”.  Little’s
    score of thirty-five places him at the ninety-sixth percentile for possible
    test response, indicating that of one hundred randomly selected federal inmates,
    ninety-five would have lower scores than Little.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Little
    also scored thirty on the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) test, which
    Dr. Klassen considers to be the best available actuarial tool concerning
    violent recidivism.  With respect to this score, Dr. Klassen commented in
    the CAMH report:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is an extremely high score, and is suggestive
    of a high likelihood of future violent behaviour; individuals in the reference
    or standardization sample with similar scores recidivated at rates of 100%
    over 7 years opportunity in the community.  This score places Mr. Little
    on the 99th percentile with respect to the reference sample.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[E]ven a score of 22 on the VRAG is a high score,
    at the 95th percentile, and individuals with similar scores recidivated violently
    or sexually at a rate of 82% over 10 years opportunity in the community.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    Dr. Klassen also confirmed in the CAMH report that, “There is no treatment
    that has been shown to ameliorate the core or fundamental aspects of psycho-pathy.”  Dr.
    Klassen also indicated that some studies suggest that “individuals with high
    PCL-R scores in fact perform more poorly on release after receiving treatment,
    than had they not received treatment.”  In Dr. Klassen’s view, if such individuals
    also possess verbal dexterity, as Little does, they have the ability to manipulate
    others into believing that they have achieved self-change when in fact genuine
    behaviour modification has not taken place.  As a result, Dr. Klassen suggested,
    individuals of this type “may receive less intense community supervision”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    uncontradicted aspects of Dr. Klassen’s testimony confirm that Little’s condition
    is not amenable to treatment.  Moreover, and of equal concern, Little does
    not appear to be committed to behavioural change.  Both his history and his
    psychiatric profile suggest that he is adept at masking his continued disinterest
    and lack of progress in rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen concluded that Little is at high risk of violent recidivism for at
    least a decade.  He has virtually no confidence that psychological treatment
    would yield any substantial behavioural change in Little.  There is no suggestion
    that Little would benefit from pharmacological treatment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen also testified about the possibility that Little’s risk of violent
    recidivism would decline as he ages.  He said that although older persons
    with high PCL-R scores retain their psychopathic values and attitudes as
    they age, they also lose their energy to offend.  Importantly, however, Dr.
    Klassen cautioned that this “burnout” theory may be less applicable to offenders,
    like Little, who engage in relationship or domestic partner violence.  In
    the CAMH report, Dr. Klassen expressed the following reservation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The burnout theory] may be somewhat less applicable
    to individuals who engage fundamentally in domestic violence, as their targets
    for violence are readily available, and are more vulnerable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his testimony at the dangerous offender hearing, Dr. Klassen elaborated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, with respect to partner violence, I wouldn’t
    expect, I’m not as confident with the partner violence issue as I am with
    for example the security guard or you know, violence in the community issue,
    but I think you would be in a better position, you would be closer to an
    acceptable level of aggressive behaviour, even unsupervised, if you got him
    sort of close[r] to 50 than now.  You would be in better shape.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    Dr. Klassen’s view, Little might be designated a long-term offender and released
    into the community only under what he termed “strict and tight external controls”.  These
    controls, he suggested, should include supervised substance abuse treatment
    on a daily basis, likely in perpetuity; residence in a community correctional
    centre for a protracted period of time; severe consequences for any transgression
    by Little of the conditions of his release; and supervision of Little by
    probation and parole officials who are experienced with issues concerning
    psychopaths and who have the resources to “spot check” Little during both
    the day and evening.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Dr. Klassen stressed that even the imposition of these kinds of strict controls “may
    not entirely prevent violence”.  Rather, he stated, “any violent recidivism
    that does take place may be less serious than that which has taken place
    previously”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    Dr. Klassen offered the following opinion regarding the risk posed by Little:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I believe that [Little], from a purely psychiatric
    perspective, meets the threshold for Dangerous Offender sentencing.  I would
    be prepared to endorse the notion of
    “reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community”,
    if very substantial resources could be allotted to this individual’s risk
    management in the future, and if a harm reduction approach is utilized, as
    opposed to a “zero tolerance” approach. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also led evidence at the dangerous offender hearing about the resources
    available to supervise long-term offenders in the community and the practices
    and policies of the Correctional Service of Canada (the CSC) and the Parole
    Board regarding such offenders upon release from custody.  I will refer to
    this evidence in the course of discussing the issues in respect of which
    it is relevant.</p>

  <h2>III.       Trial Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge summarized her conclusions regarding Little at paras. 233 and
    250-51 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I accept Dr. Klassen’s evidence that Little will
    not, in any meaningful way, invest in treatment.  As he has never been subjected
    to strict conditions, but rather indulged, when on probation and on parole,
    it is difficult for me to conclude that strict conditions of parole and/or
    long-term supervision might not reduce his risk of re-offence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Little meets the criteria for designation as a Dangerous
    Offender, as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(i)(ii)(iii) [of the <i>Code</i>].  The
    physical injuries sustained by [K.M.], and the psychological trauma of this
    incident, constitute serious personal injury as that term has been defined
    in recent cases.  I have also concluded that the totality of the circumstances
    of the predicate offence, including the force and violence used during the
    attempted home invasion meet the test of brutality in [s.]753(1)(a)(iii).  He
    also meets the criteria for the Long-Term Offender designation referred to
    in [ss.] 753.1(1) &amp; 753.1(2)(b)(i).  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dr. Klassen’s evidence is that Little’s risk of
    violently re-offending is extremely high, and perhaps a virtual certainty,
    for the next 10 years.  I conclude that he poses an unaccept-able risk to
    cause serious personal injury during that 10 year period.  The impact of
    the aging process on his criminality, as described by Klassen, is such that,
    after age 45, a reasonable possibility of control in the community exists.  Therefore,
    I will exercise my discretion and not declare Little to be a Dangerous Offender.  He
    will be declared a Long Term Offender, and this Court will impose a Long
    Term Super-vision Order of 10 years.</p>

    is no challenge before this court to the trial judge’s finding that Little
    meets the statutory criteria for designation as a dangerous offender specified
    under ss.753(1) <i>(a)</i>(i) to (iii) of the <i>Code</i>.  Those sections
    provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)   The court may, on application made under this
    Part following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2),
    find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>(a)</i>       that the offence for which the
    offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described
    in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and
    the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental
    well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour

    damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive

    other persons of his or her behaviour, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (iii) any behaviour by the offender,
    associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that

      such criteria are met, as in this case, a sentencing judge retains the
      discretion to designate a person a long-term offender and to impose a term
      of imprisonment of two years or more, followed by a community supervision
      order of up to ten years.  Section 753.1(1) of the <i>Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       The court may, on application made under

    this case, the trial judge held that Little met all the above-quoted criteria
    for designation as a long-term offender.  The issue on this appeal is whether
    the trial judge was justified in concluding that the precondition for such
    a designation set out under s.&nbsp;753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> was satisfied.  In
    other words, the question is whether it was open to the trial judge to hold
    that “a reasonable possibility of eventual control of [Little’s] risk in
    the community” exists.</p>

    Crown argues that this central holding by the trial judge is unsustainable
    because there was no evidence at the dangerous offender hearing that Little
    was treatable or that he would “probably” be cured or rehabilitated within
    a fixed time.  The trial judge’s disposition, the Crown claims, undermines
    the basic purpose of the dangerous offender regime – the protection of the
    public – and
    “gamble[s] with the safety of the community”.  The Crown asserts that the
    trial judge misinterpreted the long-term offender provisions in the <i>Code</i> and <i>Johnson,
    supra</i>, when she stated at para. 249 of her reasons that <i>Johnson</i> “speaks
    to management, rather than elimination of the risk, and controlling the behaviour

    do not agree that the trial judge misinterpreted <i>Johnson</i> when she
    concluded that it confirmed a “harm reduction”, rather than a “risk elimination”,
    focus to the existing long-term offender provisions in the <i>Code</i>.  However,
    for reasons that I will explain, in the circumstances of this case it is
    my opinion that the trial judge erred by imposing a determinate sentence
    in the absence of evidence either that Little could be meaningfully treated
    within a definite period of time, or that the resources needed to implement
    the supervision conditions that the trial judge concluded were necessary
    to eventually control Little’s risk in the community were available, so as
    to bring Little’s risk of future reoffending within tolerable limits.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Johnson</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada held that if an offender’s risk can be managed
    in the community, a sentencing judge cannot properly declare the offender
    a dangerous offender and sentence him or her to indeterminate detention.  Justices
    Iacobucci and Arbour, writing for the court, stated at paras. 29 and 32:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The principles of sentencing thus dictate that a
    judge ought to impose an indeterminate sentence only in those instances in
    which there does not exist less restrictive means <i>by which to protect
    the public adequately from the threat of harm,</i> i.e., where a definite
    sentence or long-term offender designation are insufficient.  <i>The essential
    question to be determined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctions available
    pursuant to the long-term offender provisions are sufficient to reduce this
    threat to an acceptable level, despite the fact that the statutory criteria
    in s. 753(1) have been met</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>If the public threat can be reduced to an acceptable

    agree with the trial judge that these passages address the concept of risk
    reduction, rather than risk elimination, as embodied in the long-term offender
    provisions in the <i>Code</i> and in the traditional principles of sentencing.  This
    is consistent with the plain language of s. 753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> of the <i>Code</i>,
    which focuses on the “control” of an offender’s risk in the community.  The
    use of the word “control” connotes the containment or management of risk,
    as opposed to the eradication of risk.  Moreover, s.&nbsp;753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> requires
    that there be a “reasonable possibility”, rather than a certainty, of the
    eventual control of the risk posed by an offender.</p>

    must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope

    do not read <i>Johnson</i> as displacing the principle that, to achieve the
    goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender and long-term
    offender provisions in the <i>Code</i>, evidence of treatability that (i)
    is more than mere speculative hope, and (ii) indicates that the specific
    offender in question can be treated within an ascertainable time frame, is
    required.  The requisite judicial inquiry on a dangerous offender application,
    mandated by <i>Johnson</i>, is concerned with whether the sentencing sanctions
    available under the long-term offender provisions of the <i>Code</i> are “sufficient
    to reduce [the offender’s] threat to an <i>acceptable</i> level”.  [Emphasis
    added.]  The determination of whether an offender’s risk can be reduced to
    an “acceptable” level requires consideration of all factors, including treatability,
    that can bring about sufficient risk reduction to ensure protection of the
    public.  This does not require a showing that an offender will be “cured” through
    treatment or that his or her rehabilitation may be assured.  What it does
    require, however, is proof that the nature and severity of an offender’s
    identified risk can be sufficiently contained in the community, a non-custodial
    setting, so as to protect the public.</p>

    follows that unless other measures, <i>i.e.</i>, adequate community supervision,
    are available to control Little’s risk in the community, it was an error
    for the trial judge to designate Little a long-term offender and to impose
    a determinate sentence.  As I read her reasons, the trial judge’s disposition
    was not based on Little’s treatment prospects.  Rather, the trial judge concluded
    that Little can eventually be controlled safely in the community by preventing
    his release into the community for ten years and by imposing the maximum
    long-term supervision order permissible at law – ten years
    – subject to stringent conditions.  I will address this critical finding
    by the trial judge later in these reasons.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Burnout Theory </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown next argues that the trial judge misapprehended Dr. Klassen’s evidence
    of the burnout theory and that this error led her to further err by concluding
    that Little will pose an acceptable risk by the time that he is forty-five
    years of age or older.  In essence, the Crown submits that due to her flawed
    appreciation of the evidence of the burnout theory as potentially applicable
    to Little, the trial judge underestimated the gravity and anticipated duration
    of Little’s risk to reoffend.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen indicated that the reduction in recidivism to be expected on the
    aging of offenders like Little – psychopaths or individuals who suffer from
    antisocial personality disorder – “tends” to become evident by the fifth
    decade of life.  As I have said, however, he warned that this phenomenon
    may be “somewhat less applicable” to individuals like Little, who engage
    in domestic violence with readily available, vulnerable partners. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge addressed Dr. Klassen’s evidence of the risk posed by Little,
    including his evidence of the burnout theory, in several passages of her
    lengthy reasons.  Her reasons indicate that she was clearly alive to, and
    understood, the nature of the theory described by Dr. Klassen, the qualifications
    placed by him on its possible application to an offender like Little, and
    his opinion concerning the gravity and anticipated duration of the risk posed
    by Little.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras. 144, 147, 212, 221 and 223 of her reasons, the trial judge squarely
    addressed the expert evidence that told against the possibility that the
    risk posed by Little could be adequately controlled in the community upon
    his release from custody.  Although she accepted Dr. Klassen’s evidence that,
    for offenders like Little, relationship or partner violence may be less likely
    with advancing age, she was also mindful of his admonition that, even in
    their forties or fifties, such offenders retain a potential for personal
    injury offences and that Little, especially, could be expected upon release
    to again target vulnerable domestic partners.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge understood the nature of the burnout theory and took into
    account the uncertainties of when and to what extent it might apply to Little.  This
    included the possibility that given the type of violent conduct in which
    Little has previously engaged, the beneficial impact of burnout might be
    reduced or rendered inapplicable in his case.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       Community Supervision of Little</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s decision to designate Little a long-term offender and to impose
    a determinate sentence was premised on the need to incapacitate Little in
    a custodial setting for ten years and thereafter, to seek to control his
    risk of reoffending by imposing the longest available period of community
    supervision on “the strictest possible terms”.  The trial judge put it this
    way at paras. 254-55 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The purpose of this sentencing is to incapacitate
    Little for the 10 year period during which, according to expert evidence,
    he will almost certain[ly] recidivate violently if released to the community.  Treatment
    will not “cure” him.  As an intelligent pathological liar and psychopath,
    I am persuaded by Dr. Klassen that he will not meaningfully commit to treatment.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The objective here is to control [Little] by means
    of a lengthy period of incarceration and a 10 year period of supervision
    in the community on the strictest possible terms.  No sentence, short of
    a 10 year period of incarceration from this date, would justify the use of
    the discretion granted to me to not declare him a Dangerous Offender given
    that he meets all of the criteria for such a designation.  Should any of
    the determinate sentences I am imposing be reviewed by an appellate court,
    I wish that to be known.  Little has very narrowly escaped being declared
    a Dangerous Offender, due to my interpretation of the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    ruling in <b>Johnson</b> in light of the evidence of Dr. Klassen.  Little
    is and will remain a dangerous and violent man.  Had I had the option of
    declaring him a Dangerous Offender and recom-mending that he [be] released
    after a ten year period, I would have done so.  The evidence before me, from
    a few witnesses, reveals that, as a Dangerous Offender he might well remain
    incarcerated for a much longer period than that.  As such, the application
    of the Long Term Offender provisions provide[s] a less restrictive sanction
    as per <b>Johnson</b>. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is apparent from these comments that the trial judge concluded that a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of Little’s risk in the community could be
    afforded through stringent community monitoring measures rather than treatment.  This
    court has recognized that, in a proper case, sufficient community supervision
    can satisfy the precondition to a long-term offender designation set out
    under s. 753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> of the <i>Code</i>.  See for example, <i>R. v.
    Howell</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 383 (C.A.).  In accordance with <i>Johnson</i> at
    paras. 29-30, the issue is whether the external monitoring controls proposed
    in a given case are available and sufficient to “reduce [the offender’s]
    threat to an acceptable level”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Crown argues that because (i) the evidence at the dangerous
    offender hearing demonstrated “the impossibility of giving effect” to the
    conditions of supervision recommended by the trial judge, and (ii) the recommended
    conditions were beyond the trial judge’s control and jurisdiction, the trial
    judge erred by relying on them to anchor her finding that there was a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of Little’s risk in the community.  Given
    the record in this case, I agree with the first submission for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    pointed out by Dr. Klassen, the supervision conditions in issue require the
    dedication of “very substantial resources”.  The evidence at the dangerous
    offender hearing, however, established that many of the requisite resources
    are unavailable or unrealistic under present resourcing conditions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not propose to examine each of the conditions recommended by the trial
    judge in detail.  The following examples illustrate that many of the key
    conditions recommended by her are either unrealistic or unlikely to ever
    attach to Little:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen suggested, and the trial judge recommended, that on his release from
    custody Little reside in a community correctional centre for a protracted
    period of time.  However, s.135.1(2) of the <i>Corrections and Conditional
    Release Act</i>, S.C. 1992, c. 20 limits the period of an offender’s residency
    in such a centre to ninety days.  The evidence of Parole Board officials
    at the dangerous offender hearing indicated that although this ninety-day
    residency period is renewable, it may only be extended on a limited, rather
    than an indefinite, basis.  Moreover, such extensions are regarded by the
    Parole Board as “going out on a legal limb”;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen also emphasized, and the trial judge accepted, that community supervision
    of Little would likely be ineffective unless he was “severely consequenced” for
    any breach of the conditions of his long-term offender supervision order.  However,
    the evidence before the trial judge established that the Parole Board has
    no jurisdiction to reincarcerate an offender for the breach of such an order.  Rather,
    the Board is required to persuade the police to lay a breach charge against
    the offender under the <i>Code</i>.  In practical terms, given the time and
    resources involved, parole officers are unlikely to seek such recourse for
    minor transgressions by an offender;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Moreover, the Community Residential Facility Stan-dards
    governing parole officers require that where a breach of a long-term offender
    supervision order occurs, all feasible alternatives to maintain the offender
    in the community must be assessed “to the fullest extent possible”.  The
    trial judge herself recog-nized at paras. 236 and 239 of her reasons that
    this policy of “least restrictive measures” is inappropriate for Little and “totally
    insufficient to monitor and control Little’s behaviour in the community”;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)     Dr. Klassen also urged that Little be
    supervised by probation and parole officers who are experienced with the
    supervision of psychopaths and who have the resources available to “spot
    check”
    Little throughout the day and evening.  On the evidence before the trial
    judge, however, long-term offenders are monitored in the community by corrections
    personnel in the same manner as are regular offenders.  No specialists are
    assigned to work with long-term offenders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    on this record, the evidence of the resources available to supervise the
    reintegration into the community of long-term offenders did not support many
    of the critical monitoring conditions recommended by the trial judge.  That
    these conditions were fundamental to her finding that Little’s risk eventually
    could be sufficiently controlled in the community after he turns forty-five
    is evident from the following comments by the trial judge at para. 236 of
    her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>It is my recommendation that each of the proposed
      special conditions, agreed to by Little and submitted by counsel be imposed.  These
      are attached as Appendix E.  I support all of Dr. Klassen’s evidence and
      conclusions, as detailed in this decision, and recommend that they be adopted.  A
      harm reduction model needs to be put in place to supervise Little.  He
      will need a residency requirement upon release, preferably to

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Center [a community correctional centre] or a place like it with 24 hour
    supervision.  His significant substance abuse problem with alcohol and drugs
    needs to be vigilantly monitored and treated.  He needs to be subject to
    frequent and random drug and alcohol testing.  The consequences to him of
    any breaches should be swift and severe to prevent a relapse into serious
    violent behaviour which would greatly endanger the public and particularly
    women.  His self reports should never be relied on due to his anti social
    personality traits...He needs to be supervised by an experienced and well
    trained case manager, in conjunction with a forensic psychologist or psychiatrists
    with knowledge of the behaviour patterns of psychopaths and pathological
    liars.  He should report in person at a maximum level of supervision.</i> [Emphasis

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    determining whether a reasonable possibility of the eventual control of an
    offender’s risk in the community exists, conflict can arise between the inadequacy
    or unavailability of the resources necessary to implement stringent community
    supervision, on the one hand, and the need to ensure that an offender is
    not deprived of liberty <span style='font-family:
Symbol;
'>-</span> if less restrictive sanctions are appropriate in the circumstances <span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>-</span> on the other hand: see for example, s. 718.2<i>(d)</i> of the <i>Code</i> and <i>Johnson,
    supra</i>, at para. 22.  The following statement by the trial judge at para.
    225 of her reasons indicates that she was acutely aware of the tension between
    these factors:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is evident to me, from the evidence of [the Crown’s
    witnesses from the CSC and the Parole Board], that the legislator did not
    foresee this onslaught of applications, which are, for the most part, resulting
    in offenders being declared long-term offenders.  As a result, <i>a question
    arises as to whether Little should be defaulted into Dangerous Offender status
    because there does not appear to be suitable resources allocated, as of now,
    for the management of such offenders</i> through residential structured housing,
    frequent and random urinalysis, and other things of that nature which are
    costly but necessary to effect adequate supervision in the community.  [Emphasis

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge appears to have resolved this dilemma by proceeding on the assumption
    that the resources necessary to implement her recommended supervision conditions,
    although neither committed nor available at the time of the dangerous offender
    hearing, will be in place when Little is released from custody.  In my view,
    with respect, the trial judge erred in so doing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test under s. 753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> of the <i>Code</i> is whether “there <i>is</i> a
    reasonable possibility of eventual control of [an offender’s] risk in the
    community”.  [Emphasis added.]  <i>Johnson</i> confirms, at para. 29, that,
    at a dangerous offender hearing, “the essential question to be determined…is
    whether the sentencing sanctions <i>available</i> pursuant to the long-term
    offender provisions <i>are</i> sufficient to reduce [the offender’s] threat
    to an acceptable level”.  [Emphasis added.]  These articulations of the relevant
    risk management inquiry contemplate the present, rather than the future,
    existence of measures sufficient to control risk.  </p>

    my view, both s. 753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> of the <i>Code</i> and <i>Johnson</i> envisage
    that where the determination that an offender’s risk may be safely controlled
    in the community rests, as it did here, on adequate community supervision,
    rather than treatment, the availability of the resources necessary to implement
    such supervision effectively cannot be uncertain.  To hold otherwise would
    be speculative, thereby preventing any reliable assurance that unreasonable
    risks to public safety can be avoided.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, as I have detailed at para. 54 of these reasons, the record before
    the trial judge demonstrated that several of the key supervision conditions
    recommended by her are incapable of performance, as a result of the current
    law or the resourcing con-ditions applicable to long-term offenders.  In
    these circumstances, in my view, the trial judge’s conclusion that there
    is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of Little’s risk in the community,
    after he attains the age of forty-five, cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would make two further observations.  First, as I have said, the supervision
    controls recommended by the trial judge were described by Dr. Klassen as
    “unusual”, “stringent”, “severe” and “strict and tight”.  I agree.  The recommended
    conditions called for almost twenty-four hour monitoring of Little in the
    community by officials expert in his type of disorders, coupled with Little’s
    residency in a controlled environment, for ten years.  Even if the resources
    necessary to create such a lengthy offender-specific form of community supervision
    existed, a conclusion that I have already indicated is not supported by the
    evidence in this case, the overall form of supervision proposed comes close
    to replicating in the community the form of monitoring and supervision that
    the state provides in custodial settings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    I recognize that under s. 134.1(2) of the <i>Corrections and Conditional
    Release Act, </i>conditions of supervision may include those that are “reasonable
    and necessary in order to protect society”, I do not believe that that statute
    or the long-term offender regime is intended to virtually replicate jail-like
    conditions in the community for offenders released from custody.  Where restrictive
    conditions of this type, like those proposed by the trial judge in this case,
    are necessary to control the risk of reoffending by an offender, and to thereby
    protect the public, the dangerous offender provisions of the <i>Code</i> are
    engaged.  In other words, protection of the public is paramount.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the issue of the impact of limited institutional resources on the criminal
    justice system has been considered by the courts in a number of contexts,
    most noteably in connection with the constitutional rights enshrined in ss.
    7 and 11(b) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  In that context,
    the Supreme Court of Canada has held that while account must be taken of
    the difficulties in securing full adequate funding, personnel and facilities
    for the administration of criminal justice, this consideration cannot be
    used to denude of meaning the rights protected under the <i>Charter</i>.  See
    for example, <i>R. v. MacDougall</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 45; <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992),
    71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); <i>Mills v. The Queen</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 (S.C.C.); and <i>Singh v.

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177.  Similarly,
    in my view, resourcing limitations cannot be used to render meaningless the
    long-term offender regime enacted by Parliament.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. A.N.</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 5026 (S.C.J.), a case relied upon by Little
      in this proceeding, the court addressed the <i>Charter</i> implications
      of the failure to provide an adequate infrastructure for the supervision
      of long-term offenders.  The court concluded that the provision of treatment
      programs and a reasonable infrastructure for the supervision of long-term
      offenders in the community is necessary to ensure that the dangerous offender
      provisions in the <i>Code</i> are compatible with <i>Charter</i> rights.  At
      para. 199 of <i>A.N.</i>, the trial judge stated, “[T]he issue of whether
      an offender can be controlled in the community must be decided based on
      the assumption that reasonable resources for supervision and treatment
      will be available to support the long-term supervision order [imposed by
      the court].”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, <i>A.N.</i> is of limited assistance in this case.  The trial judge’s
    finding in <i>A.N.</i> that there was a reasonable possibility of eventually
    controlling the accused’s risk in the community was based on evidence that
    treatment was available for him in the community through specific health
    care professionals and that programming and monitoring resources existed
    to implement some of the conditions of community supervision proposed for
    A.N.  That is not this case.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, <i>A.N.</i> was
    based in part on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Nault</i>, [2002] O.J.
    No. 2017.  In <i>Nault</i>, this court was concerned with a sentencing judge’s
    rejection of a joint submission for a conditional sentence based on the sentencing
    judge’s own perception of a lack of resources in the community to supervise
    conditional sentences.  This court reversed the sentencing judge’s disposition
    on several grounds, including on the basis that, contrary to the sentencing
    judge’s holding, the record in <i>Nault</i> established that sufficient community
    resources in fact existed to supervise the offender on a conditional sentence.  In
    addition, this court commented at paras. 8 and 9:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Crown counsel had been clear that the Crown had
    seriously considered the situation of the accused before agreeing to recommend
    a sentence to be served in the community.  <i>If the Crown was not satisfied
    that appropriate resources were available to supervise or enforce such a
    sentence, the court is entitled to assume that the recommendation would not
    have been made</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>   In a situation where the sentencing judge
      is concerned about the available resources, the judge should ask counsel
      to advise the court of the proposed supervision plan, and if necessary,
      provide evidence that the proposed supervision will be in place</i>.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    that context, the court went on in <i>Nault</i> to endorse the proposition,
    articulated by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Makar</i>, [2000]
    M.J. No. 458, that “it cannot be up to the will of any province to effectively
    preclude the imposition of conditional sentences by failing to provide sufficient
    supervisory resources”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    my reading of it, <i>Nault</i> recognizes that the availability of resources
    sufficient to supervise or enforce a conditional sentence must be established
    to support the imposition of such a sentence.  In other words, where the
    availability of the requisite resources is in doubt, evidence must be led
    that “the proposed supervision will be in place.”</p>

    this case, we are concerned with the exercise by a trial judge of her discretion
    not to declare a person a dangerous offender notwithstanding that he satisfies
    the statutory criteria for such a designation.  In contrast to the facts
    in <i>A.N.</i>, effective treatment for Little is not an option.  Moreover,
    the evidence at Little’s dangerous offender hearing established that the
    resources necessary to implement many of the core conditions of supervision
    recommended by the trial judge, on which eventual control of the risk posed
    by Little is dependent, are not available.  There was no evidence before
    the trial judge that existing resourcing conditions will or are likely to
    change in the foresee-able future.  Nor was there any evidence of an intention
    to amend or remove the legislative impediments to the implementation of some
    of the recommended conditions, <i>i.e.</i>, s.135.1(2) of the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i>.  </p>

    I have indicated, the overriding purpose of the dangerous and long-term offender
    regimes is the protection of the public.  Thus, ‘real world’ resourcing limitations
    cannot be ignored or minimized where to do so would endanger public safety.  The
    court is required on a dangerous offender application to balance the liberty
    interests of an accused with the risk to public safety that will arise on
    the release of the accused into the community.  That balancing exercise is
    informed by this fundamental principle: in a contest between an individual
    offender’s interest in invoking the long-term offender provisions of the <i>Code</i> and
    the protection of the public, the latter must prevail.  This accords, in
    my opinion, with the intention of Parliament as expressed in the dangerous
    and long-term offender provisions of the <i>Code</i>, and in the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i>.</p>

    conclude, therefore, that the long-term offender designation of Little cannot
    stand.  As a result, the determinate sentence and long-term offender supervision
    order imposed by the trial judge must be set aside.</p>

    a result of that decision, the question arises whether a new dangerous offender
    hearing is required in the circumstances of this case.  I conclude that it
    is not necessary.  The trial judge held that Little satisfies the requisite
    statutory criteria for designation as a dangerous offender.  That finding,
    which is supported by the evidentiary record, is not challenged by Little
    on this appeal.  The trial judge undertook a comprehensive analysis of the
    sentencing factors relevant to Little, fully considered the criteria set
    out in the long-term offender provisions, and made numerous findings of fact.  On
    her own analysis, she observed that Little
    “very narrowly escaped being declared a Dangerous Offender”.</p>

    for the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, declare that Little is not
    a long-term offender, quash the long-term offender supervision order made
    by the trial judge, and declare that Little is a dangerous offender.</p>
