    is a motion for an order extending the time for serving and filing a Notice
    of Motion for Leave to Appeal to the Court of Appeal.  The motion raises
    issues concerning the scope of the right to appeal a decision of an arbitration
    tribunal and requires reconciling earlier decisions of this court.  The underlying
    dispute involves three insurance companies and the Fault Determination Rules,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 668 (the
    “Rules”), issued under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, <span lang=EN>R.S.O. 1990,

    Insurance Company (“Pilot”) has paid and continues to pay statutory accident
    benefits to its insured as a result of injuries suffered in a motor vehicle
    accident.  An arbitrator was appointed pursuant to s. 275 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> to determine whether Lombard Insurance Co. (“Lombard”) or Axa Assurance
    Inc. (“Axa”) were liable to indemnify Pilot.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard’s argument to the arbitrator was that Rule 12(4) of the Fault Determination
    Rules applied.  That rule directs that 100% of the fault in a collision between
    two vehicles driving in opposite directions be allocated to the vehicle that
    is over the centre line of the road when the accident occurs.  The arbitrator
    concluded that Rule 12(4) did not apply because three vehicles were involved,
    and the incident was not described in any of the Fault Determination Rules.  Thereupon,
    the arbitrator applied Rule 5(1) of the Fault Determination Rules, which
    provides that the degree of fault is to be determined in accordance with
    the ordinary rules of law if an incident is not described in the Rules.  The
    arbitrator found that Lombard’s insured was 100% at fault for the collision
    and that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard was wholly liable to indemnify Pilot.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard sought to appeal the arbitrator’s decision.  Its right to appeal
    is governed by s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, <span lang=EN>S.O.
    1991, c. 17, </span>that provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>If the arbitration
    agreement does not deal with appeals on questions of law, a party may appeal
    an award to the court on a question of law with leave, which the court shall

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       the
    importance to the parties of the matters at stake in the arbitration justifies
    an appeal; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

    affect the rights of the parties.</p>

    application judge took the view that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lombard’s appeal would involve more than a question of law.  He stated that
    findings of fact were necessary to determine what vehicles were involved
    in the incident, which of the Fault Determination Rules applied, and, for
    that matter, whether the incident was even described in the Rules.  Consequently,
    the application judge refused to grant
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard leave to appeal the arbitrator’s decision.  </p>

    application judge went on to state what he would have done had the appeal
    involved only a question of law.  First, he indicated he would have granted
    leave because he considered that subsections (a) and (b) of s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration
    Act </i>would be satisfied.  Second, he indicated he would have dismissed
    the appeal on its merits because, in his view, the arbitrator had made no
    error of law.</p>

    Lombard now seeks to appeal the application judge’s decision to this court.  Section

    for Leave to Appeal to this court was not served until March 7, 2007, after

    extension of time necessary.  </p>

    respondent submits the applicant’s Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal is
    ill conceived.  The respondent submits the issue is not whether the Court
    of Appeal may grant leave to appeal, but whether
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard can proceed with any appeal until it has first obtained leave from
    the Superior Court to appeal the arbitrator’s decision.</p>

    on this court’s decision in <i>Hillmond Investments Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial</i> <i>Bank
    of Commerce</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 612 (C.A.)<i>,</i> the respondent submits
    that generally there is no appeal from a decision refusing leave to appeal,
    and that in those exceptional cases where such a right exists, the appeal
    lies to the Divisional Court.  In <i>Hillmond</i>, this court quashed an
    appeal from a decision refusing leave to appeal an arbitrator’s decision
    under s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  Finlayson J.A. said, at 618, “Allowing
    an appeal from a refusal to grant leave to appeal defeats the object of arbitration
    by frustrating the legislated impediment to appeals as of right.  The purpose
    of s. 45 of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> is to stop an appeal unless
    the [Superior Court] grants leave.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finlayson
    J.A. recognized there should be redress in exceptional circumstances.  Where
    a Superior Court judge “mistakenly declines jurisdiction on a leave motion
    by acting upon a wrong principle, redress should be had to an appellate court”: <i>Hillmond</i> at
    624.  However, he observed at 625 that this limited right of appeal would
    be to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, not the Court of Appeal, “because the order, however mistaken,
    still is not a final order: it remains interlocutory.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the subsequent decision <i>Denison Mines</i> <i>Ltd. v. Ontario Hydro </i>(2001),
    56 O.R. (3d) 181 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court took a somewhat different view.   In that case, a judge of
    the Superior Court had found that the parties had agreed there would be no
    appeal from the decision of the arbitrator.  The judge therefore dismissed
    an application by Denison Mines for leave to appeal from an arbitrator’s
    award without considering whether leave to appeal should be granted according
    to the criteria of s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  Denison Mines
    appealed to this court.  The respondent, Ontario Hydro, moved to quash the
    appeal on the grounds that there was no right of appeal or that the refusal
    to grant leave was an interlocutory decision.  Writing for a unanimous court,
    Morden J.A. re-iterated the holding of <i>Hillmond</i> at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The non-appealability
    of decisions refusing or granting leave to appeal is the general rule and,
    subject to the exception to which I shall refer shortly, it should, as <i>Hillmond</i> held,
    be applicable to appeals from orders made under s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>.  The rule flows from the strong implication that, notwithstanding
    the wording of s. 6(1)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, a general
    statute, no appeal is intended from an order made refusing or granting leave
    to appeal.  Any other conclusion would defeat the purpose of s. 45(1), which
    is to limit appellate recourse to the courts in arbitration matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Morden
    J.A. went on to explain at para. 8 that there is an exception to this general
    rule “where the judge mistakenly declines jurisdiction.”  However, he took
    a different view of whether the order dismissing a motion or application
    for leave to appeal under s.&nbsp;45(1) was interlocutory or final.  He noted,
    at para. 12, that the leading authority in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario on the final/interlocutory distinction is <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i>,
    [1932] O.R. 675 (C.A.), which stands for the principle “that orders that
    finally determine the issues raised in an application are final orders”.  Morden
    J.A. pointed out that the court in <i>Hillmond</i> did not follow <i>Hendrickson.  </i>Morden
    J.A. reasoned that the decision to deny leave to appeal finally disposed
    of the moving party’s substantive right to relief and consequently was a
    final order.  The court in <i>Denison Mines</i> refused to quash the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to note that the appeal that was allowed to proceed in <i>Denison
    Mines</i> was whether the appellant had the right to seek leave to appeal.  Ultimately,
    this court, in a decision reported at 58 O.R. (3d) 26 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Superior Court to determine
    Denison Mine’s application for leave to appeal the arbitration decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent also relied on <i>Milton (Town) v. Kalmoni Establishments Inc.</i> (1996),
    31 O.R. (3d) 157 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), but I did not find the case helpful.  In that case, this court held that
    where a single judge of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court refuses leave to appeal a decision of the Ontario Municipal
    Board, the applicant must move before a full panel of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court to set aside the order before seeking recourse in this court.  The
    case concerns a quite different issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    regard<i> Denison Mines</i> as stating the applicable legal principle and
    so conclude that a decision of the Superior Court refusing leave to appeal
    is a final order.  Consequently, s. 6 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> is
    not an impediment to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard’s appeal.           </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    impediment that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard faces is the rule stated in <i>Hillmond</i> and re-iterated in <i>Denison
    Mines</i> that there is no appeal from a refusal to grant leave under s.&nbsp;45(1)
    of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, save where the Superior Court judge mistakenly
    declines jurisdiction.  </p>

    turn to that question keeping in mind that the issue I must decide is whether
    time should be extended to permit the filing of the Notice of Application
    for Leave to Appeal.  In order to assess whether the proposed Application
    has sufficient merit to warrant an extension of time I must consider whether
    the application judge mistakenly declined jurisdiction.  In doing so I am
    not determining the merits of the Application for Leave.  That would be a
    matter for a panel of this court had the Notice been filed within time.  I
    assess the merits only in so far it is a relevant factor in deciding whether
    to grant an extension of time.  The Application for Leave would be without
    merit if there was no right of appeal at all.</p>

    my view, it is clear the application judge did not decline jurisdiction but
    purported to exercise it.  The applicant recognizes this and submits that
    by acting upon a wrong principle the judge declined to exercise proper jurisdiction.  The
    applicant submits the application judge failed to act on the correct principle
    of how the Fault Determination Rules should be interpreted and applied on
    the basis of the physical positions of the vehicles at the very moment of
    impact without regard to the circumstances and their positions leading up
    to impact.  In my view, the application judge considered that contention.  He
    observed there was no language in the <i>Insurance Act</i> or the Rules that
    refers to the “moment of impact”.  Rather, s. 3 of the Rules refers to the “incident”.   I
    see no error of principle that would bring this case within the exception
    to the general rule that there is no right of appeal from a refusal to grant
    leave pursuant to s. 45 of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.</p>

    take the view that the application judge did not mistakenly decline jurisdiction
    and, consequently, there is no appeal from his refusal to grant leave to
    appeal the arbitrator’s decision.  Therefore, I refuse to grant an extension
    of time to file the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.</p>

    case this matter proceeds to a full panel, I consider an additional argument
    advanced by the respondent.  The respondent submits that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard must first successfully reverse the application judge’s refusal to
    grant leave to appeal before it can serve and file an application seeking
    leave to attack his findings on the merits of the arbitrator’s decision.    </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge’s reasons addressing the merits are akin to a court’s assessment
    of damages after a finding of no liability in a tort case.  His reasons on
    the merits are without legal effect until his refusal to grant leave has
    been set aside and replaced with an order granting leave to appeal.  Nevertheless,
    I see no reason why the applicant should not be able to raise both issues
    in one appeal, provided it is successful on the first issue before the second
    issue becomes relevant.  This would be similar to the unsuccessful plaintiff
    in a tort case appealing both a finding of no liability and the provisional
    assessment of damages in one appeal proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, admittedly the bulk of the Notice served does address the application
    judge’s findings on the merits.  However, para. 2 of the grounds for appeal
    in the Notice claims that the application judge erred by not finding the
    applicant’s appeal of the arbitrator’s decision was based on an issue of
    law only.  Therefore, I consider that the Notice identifies both the judge’s
    refusal to grant leave as well as his provisional findings on the merits.  Accordingly,
    I do regard this argument as an impediment to an extension of time being
    granted.  The sole impediment is that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lombard has no right of appeal.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, the application for an extension of time is dismissed with
    costs in favour of the respondent fixed in the amount of $1,250.00 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
