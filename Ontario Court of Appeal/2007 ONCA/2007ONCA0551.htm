      appellant raises three grounds of appeal in relation to his conviction.  He
      argues that the trial judge erred in: (1) not allowing the defence to introduce
      evidence of the deceased’s propensity for violence; (2) in instructing
      the jury that the appellant’s after–the-fact conduct was relevant to determining
      whether the appellant had the requisite intent for murder; and (3) his
      charge on self-defence under s. 34(2).</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    called on the Crown to respond only to the second ground of appeal.  While
    each issue is discussed below, we begin by noting that this was an overwhelming
    case for the Crown.  An extremely compelling piece of evidence at trial was
    that the shooting of the victim was captured on a black and white surveillance
    camera that took photos every 0 to 3 seconds.  In addition, seven witnesses
    testified for the prosecution while the appellant neither testified nor called
    any defence witnesses.  The issues at trial were whether the appellant acted
    in self-defence and, in the alternative, whether he had the requisite intent
    for murder.</p>

      weeks before the murder, the deceased’s brother had been involved in an
      altercation.  Apparently the deceased had acted as a peacemaker during
      the incident but had also attempted to kick the victim when he was already
      on the ground.  The defence sought to introduce this evidence to show the
      deceased’s propensity for violence. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    considering the proposed evidence heard on the <i>voir dire</i> – which consisted
    only of that of the victim in the incident - the trial judge ruled the evidence
    inadmissible.  He concluded that the probative value on the issue of whether
    it tended to show the probability that the deceased was the aggressor in
    this case was minimal and was outweighed by its prejudice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>T<span lang=EN-US>he
      trial judge explained that the proposed evidence consisted of a single
      incident in which the level of violence by the deceased was unknown and
      that it took place as part of an incident in which the deceased had also
      attempted to act as a peacemaker.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    trial judge’s ruling, read as a whole, demonstrates that he applied the relevant
    legal principles correctly and assessed the evidence through a weighing of
    probative value against any prejudice.  His decision was properly arrived
    at and is entitled to deference.  In any event, given the nature and quality
    of the proposed evidence; we see no error in his decision. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(2)       Did
        the trial judge err in instructing the jury that the after–the-fact conduct

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on
    after-the-fact conduct because he instructed the jury that the conduct could
    assist them in assessing whether the appellant had the requisite intent for
    murder.  The appellant concedes that this evidence was relevant to the issues
    of intoxication and self-defence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge correctly charged the jury that they could consider the appellant’s
    after-the–fact conduct on the issue of self-defence.  His instructions to
    the jury on this issue were that they could consider the after-the-fact evidence
    to decide the appellant’s state of mind; that is, whether his conduct was
    consistent with having acted in self-defence or, among other things, whether
    he had committed a crime.  There is nothing in this part of the charge that
    speaks to the issue of the requisite intent necessary for murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the evidence of intoxication, the evidence was also relevant to
    whether the appellant had the capacity to form the intent for murder.  When
    charging the jury on the issue of intoxication, the trial judge’s instructions
    included the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As I said when I mentioned that evidence earlier,
    from that evidence you may reach certain factual conclusions pertaining to
    the conduct of the accused after the shooting.  Just as what you find the
    accused did after the shooting may help you decide whether the accused acted
    in self-defence, so it may also help you in deciding whether the accused
    had a <b>state of mind</b> <b>required for murder</b> and, particularly in
    this case, the extent to which <b>the state of mind</b> of the accused was
    affected as a result of consumption of alcohol or drugs.  This evidence of
    the conduct of the accused after the shooting may help you in that regard
    or it may not.                              [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant points to the words “state of mind” in this passage and elsewhere
    as support for his argument that the trial judge instructed the jury to consider
    the after-the-fact conduct for the purpose of deciding whether the appellant
    had the <i>mens rea </i>for murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  When the charge to the jury is read as a whole, it is clear that
    in the above-quoted part of the charge, the trial judge was linking his instruction
    on intoxication with the instruction he had given on self-defense.  That
    is, he was instructing the jury that just as after-the-fact conduct was relevant
    to a determination on the issue of self-defence, it was relevant also to
    the issue of intoxication.  When the trial judge uses the words “state of
    mind”, the jury would have understood that they were to consider whether
    he was impaired because of intoxication.  It was not intended as an instruction
    that the jury consider this evidence for the purpose of determining whether
    the appellant had committed murder or manslaughter.  Moreover, while the
    trial judge’s shorthand phrase was unfortunate, from the reference to his
    prior instructions on self-defence, it would have been clear to the jury
    that the references to
    “state of mind” were specifically linked to the issues of self-defence and
    intoxication.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant shot the victim three times, including once in the head and once
    in the stomach.  We accept the Crown’s submissions that, in the circumstances,
    the only logical basis on which the jury could find the appellant guilty
    of manslaughter, but not murder, was if they had a reasonable doubt with
    respect to provocation, accident or intoxication.  Once the Crown had negated
    those defences, the only appropriate verdict was murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would also note that the trial judge canvassed and provided counsel with
    a copy of his proposed charge in connection with the after-the-fact conduct.  Defence
    counsel agreed with the proposed charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in the circumstances we see nothing in the trial judge’s instructions on
    after-the-fact conduct that constitutes reversible error. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    essence of this ground of appeal is that the Crown’s closing address left
    the jury with the impression that retreat was a necessary component of self-defence.  We
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant made no claim at trial that he feared that the group, acting together,
    would kill or seriously injure him.  Indeed, there was no air of reality
    to this claim.  The Crown’s impugned comments to the jury, when the closing
    arguments are read as a whole, are directed at the degree of the threat to
    the appellant and not to retreat being a necessary component of self-defence.  This
    did not require further instruction by the trial judge.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    core of the appellant’s submissions on sentence is that the trial judge failed
    to place sufficient emphasis on the appellant’s youth.  We disagree and again
    find no error on the part of the trial judge in imposing a fifteen year period
    of parole ineligibility. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that “despite his youth”, at the time of this murder the
    appellant had a previous weapons conviction, a weapons prohibition and probation
    order, and a deportation order.  In the face of this, the appellant was in
    possession of a loaded weapon.  It is with this background that he viewed
    the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation as “less than fair”.  He was
    entitled to reach this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition the trial judge considered that this was a senseless killing that
    could have been avoided and he considered that the appellant had nine institutional
    charges and expressed no real remorse.  Moreover, the jury suggested that
    a period of seventeen years parole ineligibility was warranted, which the
    trial judge carefully considered.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view this was a properly considered sentence, which is fit in all the
    circumstances.</p>

    we dismiss the appeal against conviction and, while leave to appeal the sentence
    is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
