    case concerns allegations of bias against a judge.  More than ten years before
    the trial, the trial judge, Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court
    of Justice, was a partner of the firm that had once represented one of the
    defendants by counterclaim. Although the judge had never been involved in
    the case and his former firm no longer acted for the defendant, the plaintiff
    by counterclaim (the appellant in this court) asked the judge to recuse himself.  He
    refused.  The appellant and her counsel then walked out of the court.  The
    judge accordingly dismissed the counterclaim.  The appellant appeals against
    the dismissal of her counterclaim and argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to recuse himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    additional issue arose after the dismissal of the counterclaim.  Within days
    of the dismissal of the counterclaim, the trial judge realized that he had
    had a previous association with one of the other defendants, an accountant.  He
    informed the parties and then heard a motion asking that he set aside his
    earlier order on the basis of this newly discovered information.  The judge
    refused to do so.  The appellant also appeals against this order.</p>

    action was commenced over thirteen years ago by the purchaser of the appellant’s
    shares in a corporation that operated a drug store.  The claim by the plaintiffs
    in the original action was against the appellant for damages for failure
    to file income tax returns in a timely manner.  The appellant in turn counterclaimed
    against the plaintiffs and brought third party proceedings against her accountant,
    Joseph J. Burk, and against her former business associate, Michael Blacher,
    and Mr. Blacher’s company.  The facts giving rise to the claim, counterclaim
    and third party proceedings arose in the years 1992 to 1994.</p>

    several false starts, the trial was set to commence before Patterson J. in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor on September 27, 2005, some eleven years after the events and six
    plus years after the main action had been dismissed.  On Friday,
    <st1:date Year="2005" Day="23" Month="9" w:st="on">
    September 23, 2005, counsel for the appellant, Mr. Raymond Colautti, for
    the first time alerted the court by letter to a problem with Patterson J.
    sitting on the case.  In this letter, Mr. Colautti stated that from 1992
    to 1994, Blacher and his corporation were represented by Mr. Slopen of the
    Wilson Walker firm.  At that time, both Mr. Slopen and Mr. Patterson were
    partners in the firm.  Mr. Colautti stated that considerable correspondence
    would be filed at the trial, some of which would be on Wilson Walker letterhead
    showing Mr. Patterson as a partner.  In his letter, Mr. Colautti stated that
    he would be asking Patterson J. to recuse himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    letter was not brought to Patterson J.’s attention and so he first learned
    of the appellant’s concerns when the parties appeared for trial on Tuesday,
    September 27, 2005.  At that time, Mr. Colautti brought his motion to have
    Patterson J. disqualify himself.  The motion was advanced on the basis of
    reasonable apprehension of bias, which allegedly arose from the fact that
    during the events leading up to the filing of the claim and counterclaim,
    Mr. Patterson was a partner of the firm that represented Mr. Blacher and
    his company.  A member of that firm had filed the statement of defence to
    the counterclaim.  As he had said in his letter, Mr. Colautti submitted that
    letters from the Wilson Walker firm, on which Mr. Patterson’s name appears
    in the letterhead, would be filed at trial.  Although Mr. Colautti invited
    him to look at the correspondence, the trial judge did not do so.  Mr. Colautti
    also stated that his client was making allegations of fraud and dishonesty
    against Mr. Blacher and the trial judge would be required to make credibility
    findings involving Blacher and the appellant. There was no suggestion of
    any impropriety on behalf of the law firm itself. It is unclear when the
    Wilson Walker firm stopped acting for Mr. Blacher.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that he had no knowledge of the case when it was in the
    firm and had done no work on the case.  No one then or now disputes this
    statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that he had adopted a guideline, which he understood was
    generally adhered to in his jurisdiction, that he wait three years before
    hearing any cases involving his former firm.  He held that the fact that
    the events in the case arose when he was a partner of the firm did not change
    his view that a sufficient period, almost twelve years, had passed.  He saw
    no reason to recuse himself.  He was satisfied that he could impartially
    hear the case.  As he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>I
    cannot even see how there could be an apprehension of bias based on the facts.  There
    has been a time period passed that is certainly well in excess of any two-,
    three-year guideline.  The distinction that this took place when I was a
    partner does not elevate it to being something that suddenly becomes timeless,
    in my opinion.</p>

line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge dismissed the application.  Mr. Colautti then asked the trial
    judge to adjourn the trial so that he could bring an application for leave
    to appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. The trial judge pointed out that if the trial was adjourned,
    it could take up to a year before the matter was resolved. The trial judge
    refused to adjourn the trial. Mr. Colautti and his client then withdrew from
    the courtroom.  Since the appellant did not present any evidence in support
    of her claim, the trial judge dismissed the counterclaim with costs.</p>

    days of the dismissal of the action, the trial judge realized that he had
    had an association with the other respondent, Mr. Burk.  Counsel were informed
    of this fact during a conference call with the trial judge that had been
    arranged for that very purpose. During the call, the trial judge informed
    counsel that he had come to realize that the Mr.&nbsp;Burk who was a defendant
    to the counterclaim was the same Mr. Burk who had supplied estate accounting
    services for the Wilson Walker firm and in fact had done some work for the
    estate of his wife’s father in the 1990’s.  The trial judge then stated, “I
    believe this is important, very important, and that I should recuse myself
    because of this contact with Mr. Burk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    then informed the trial judge that the order dismissing the counterclaim
    had already been issued and entered.  Mr. Colautti took the position, however,
    that it was not too late to set aside the order because of newly discovered
    facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of the call, the trial judge stated that he was not aware of his
    relationship with Mr. Burk during the trial.  It is not disputed that the
    trial judge was unaware of his relationship with Mr. Burk when he dismissed
    the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the conference call it was eventually agreed that, if so advised, the appellant
    would bring a formal motion to set aside the judgment.  For reasons that
    are not relevant, this motion was not heard until
    <st1:date Year="2006" Day="26"
Month="5" w:st="on">
    May 26, 2006.  The motion was brought pursuant to rule 59.06 on the basis
    of facts arising or discovered after the order was made.  The trial judge
    held that he became <i>functus</i> when the order was issued and entered.  He
    dismissed the motion, saying, in part, the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The
    circumstances of the case before me being a possible recusal motion concerning
    one of the defendants Joseph Burk was not heard because the plaintiff and

    is no suggestion that the trial judge had any financial or other interest
    in this litigation even though his firm had carriage of the file in the early
    1990’s.  Nor does the appellant suggest that the trial judge was actually
    biased.  Accordingly, the issue is whether the circumstances give rise to
    a reasonable apprehension of bias because of the prior involvement of the
    trial judge’s former firm in the litigation.  In such a case, the test to
    be applied has been explained in several cases from the Supreme Court of
    Canada, most notably, <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v National Energy
    Board</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, <i>R. v. S. (R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484

    appellant relies upon statements made under the “Impartiality”
    section in <i>Ethical Principles for Judges</i> and especially, the statements,
    principles and commentary concerning former clients.  Because of their importance,
    I have set out the applicable parts, which are found at p. 47:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Judges
    will face the issue of whether they should hear cases involving former clients,
    members of the judge’s former law firm or lawyers from the government department
    or legal aid office in which the judge practised before appointment. There
    are three main factors to be considered. First, the judge should not deal
    with cases concerning which the judge actually has a conflict of interest,
    for example, as a result of having had confidential information concerning
    the matter prior to appointment. Second, circumstances must be avoided in
    which a reasonable, fair minded and informed person would have a reasoned
    suspicion that the judge is not impartial. Third, the judge should not withdraw
    unnecessarily as to do so adds to the burden of his or her colleagues and
    contributes to delay in the courts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The
    following are some general guidelines which may be helpful:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(a)  A judge who was in private practice should not sit
    on any case in which the judge or the judge’s former firm was directly involved
    as either counsel of record or in any other capacity before the judge’s appointment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>(c)  With
    respect to the judge’s former law partners, or associates and former clients,
    the traditional approach is to use a “cooling off period,” often established
    by local tradition at 2, 3 or 5 years and in any event at least as long as
    there is any indebtedness between the firm and the judge and subject to guideline
    (a) above concerning former clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that this case falls clearly within guideline (a) and that
    the trial judge should therefore have recused himself.  The appellant submits
    that the trial judge confused two different circumstances.  He applied the “cooling-off
    period” rule set out in guideline (c) to a circumstance that was more properly
    captured by guideline (a).  I agree with that submission in this sense.  It
    seems to me that the judge may well have confused the two issues.  The three-year
    rule to which he referred is, in my view, a rule that is applicable to when
    a judge should hear cases involving his former firm or former clients.  The
    cooling-off period has limited application to a case where it is alleged
    not simply that the judge’s former firm acts for one of the parties, but
    that the firm acted in the very case that is now to be tried by the judge.  This
    case involves the latter circumstance and thus, it is guideline (a) that
    is applicable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    if guideline (a) purports to lay down a firm rule, the trial judge should
    have recused himself.  But, guideline (a) is not a rule; it is a guideline
    that has only an advisory purpose.  The trial judge could not be faulted
    had he recused himself when the application was brought, but the fact that
    he did not recuse himself does not mean that he erred.  It all depends on
    the particular circumstances.  Moreover, the leading cases, far from suggesting
    that guideline (a) states a firm rule, suggest quite the opposite.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty</i> where a majority of the
    Supreme Court of Canada held that Marshall Crowe, the then Chair and Chief
    Executive Officer of the National Energy Board, was disqualified from sitting
    on hearings concerning the construction of a natural gas pipeline because
    of his prior involvement with a group that had studied and made recommendations
    on matters directly related to the matter that he was then to consider at
    the National Energy Board hearings.  In the course of considering the question
    of Mr.&nbsp;Crowe’s disqualification, Laskin C.J.C. referred to the position
    of a trial judge and former client in terms that illustrate guideline (a)
    is far from a firm rule.  He said the following in relation to the matters
    covered by guidelines (a) and (c) at p.&nbsp;388:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Lawyers
    who have been appointed to the Bench have been known to refrain from sitting
    on cases involving former clients, even where they have not had any part
    in the case, until a reasonable period of time has passed.  <i>A fortiori,
    they would not sit in any case in which they played any part at any stage
    of the case</i>.  This would apply, for example, even if they had drawn up
    or had a hand in the statement of claim or statement of defence and nothing
    else. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    this statement to the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was not
    required to disqualify himself.  He knew nothing of the case when it was
    in the firm and he played no part in the case at any stage.  Moreover, as
    the <i>Wewaykum</i> case illustrates, even the statement that a judge not
    sit on cases in which he or she played a part is not an absolute rule.  In <i>Wewaykum</i> the
    court held that even though Binnie J. had been involved in the very case
    before the court many years earlier when he was the federal Associate Deputy
    Minister of Justice, he was not disqualified from sitting on the appeal.  With
    respect to the <i>dictum</i> from <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty</i> that
    I have set out above, the court said the following at paras. 81 and 82:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>This
    dictum must be understood in the context of the principle of which it is
    but an illustration.  <i>It does not suggest that any degree of earlier participation
    in a case is cause for automatic disqualification</i>.  This statement provides
    sensible guidance for individuals to consider <i>ex ante</i>.  It suggests
    that a reasonable and right-minded person would likely view unfavourably
    the fact that the judge acted as counsel in a case over which he or she is
    presiding, and could take this fact as the foundation of a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i>However,
      contrary to what has been argued, it cannot realistically be held that
      Binnie J. acted as counsel in the present case, and the limited extent
      of his participation does not support a reasonable apprehension of bias.  To
      repeat, what is germane is the nature and extent of Binnie J.’s role. </i> The
      details of Binnie J.’s involvement in this case, as outlined in the earlier
      part of these reasons and which should be viewed in the context of his
      broad duties in the Department of Justice, would convince a reasonable
      person that his role was of a limited supervisory and administrative nature.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    disqualification is not the natural corollary to a finding that a trial judge
    has had some involvement in a case over which he or she is now presiding.
    Where the judge had no involvement, as here, it cannot be said that the judge
    is disqualified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    point can rightly be made that had Mr. Patterson been asked to represent
    the appellant as counsel before his appointment to the bench, the conflict
    rules would likely have prevented him from taking the case because his firm
    had formerly represented one of the defendants in the case.  Thus, it is
    argued how is it that as a trial judge Patterson J. can hear the case?  This
    issue was considered by the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in <i>Locabail
    (U.K.) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd.</i>, [2000] Q.B. 451.  The court
    held, at para. 58, that there is no inflexible rule governing the disqualification
    of a judge and that, “[e]verything depends on the circumstances.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that what appears at first sight to be an inconsistency in application
    of rules can be explained by the different contexts and in particular, the
    strong presumption of judicial impartiality that applies in the context of
    disqualification of a judge.  There is no such presumption in cases of allegations
    of conflict of interest against a lawyer because of a firm’s previous involvement
    in the case.  To the contrary, as explained by Sopinka J. in <i>MacDonald
    Estate v. Martin</i> (1990), 77 D.L.R. (4th) 249 (S.C.C.), for sound policy
    reasons there is a presumption of a disqualifying interest that can rarely
    be overcome.  In particular, a conclusory statement from the lawyer that
    he or she had no confidential information about the case will never be sufficient.  The
    case is the opposite where the allegation of bias is made against a trial
    judge.  His or her statement that he or she knew nothing about the case and
    had no involvement in it will ordinarily be accepted at face value unless
    there is good reason to doubt it:  see <i>Locabail</i>, at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    brings me then to consider the particular circumstances of this case and
    whether there are serious grounds to find a disqualifying conflict of interest
    in this case.  In my view, there are two significant factors that justify
    the trial judge’s decision not to recuse himself.  The first is his statement,
    which all parties accept, that he knew nothing of the case when it was in
    his former firm and that he had nothing to do with it.  The second is the
    long passage of time.  As was said in <i>Wewaykum</i>, at para. 85:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>To
    us, one significant factor stands out, and must inform the perspective of
    the reasonable person assessing the impact of this involvement on Binnie
    J.'s impartiality in the appeals. That factor is the passage of time. Most
    arguments for disqualification rest on circumstances that are either contemporaneous
    to the decision-making, or that occurred within a short time prior to the
    decision-making.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are other factors that inform the issue.  The Wilson Walker firm no longer
    acted for any of the parties by the time of trial. More importantly, at the
    time of the motion, Patterson J. had been a judge for six years and thus
    had not had a relationship with his former firm for a considerable period
    of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a reasonable person, viewing the matter realistically would conclude
    that the trial judge could deal fairly and impartially with this case.  I
    take this view principally because of the long passage of time and the trial
    judge’s lack of involvement in or knowledge of the case when the Wilson Walker
    firm had carriage.  In these circumstances it cannot be reasonably contended
    that the trial judge could not remain impartial in the case.  The mere fact
    that his name appears on the letterhead of some correspondence from over
    a decade ago would not lead a reasonable person to believe that he would
    either consciously or unconsciously favour his former firm’s former client.  It
    is simply not realistic to think that a judge would throw off his mantle
    of impartiality, ignore his oath of office and favour a client &#8722;
    about whom he knew nothing &#8722;  of a firm that he left six years earlier
    and that no longer acts for the client, in a case involving events from over
    a decade ago.</p>

    the trial judge was right to resolve the matter solely on the basis that
    he was <i>functus</i>.  Because of the view I take as to the merits of the
    rule 59.06 motion, I need not deal with those issues.</p>

    his very helpful submissions, Mr. Pape, counsel for the appellant, submitted
    that in considering the issues on this appeal and especially, the trial judge’s
    decision on the rule 59.06 motion, the court must consider the cumulative
    effect of the circumstances, beginning with the involvement of the trial
    judge’s former firm in the case and ending with the trial judge’s disclosure
    of his relationship with the respondent Burk.  In my view, in the circumstances
    of this case, this is not the correct approach.  Rather, it is necessary
    to focus on the decision the trial judge was called upon to make on September&nbsp;27,
    2005 and the circumstances that existed at that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    one disputes that when the trial judge came to deal with the counterclaim,
    after Mr. Colautti and his client had withdrawn from the courtroom, he was
    unaware of his connection to Mr. Burk.  It follows that this relationship
    could not have influenced his decision.  Further, because of Mr. Colautti’s
    action, the decision to be made about the counterclaim was essentially a
    formal one.  There was no one in the court to present evidence to support
    the counterclaim.  I fail to see how the trial judge could have come to any
    other decision.</p>

    the Court of Appeal said in <i>Locabail</i>, at para. 55, “How can there
    be any real danger of bias, or any real apprehension or likelihood of bias,
    if the judge does not know of the facts that, in argument, are relied on

    in the courtroom and presented evidence, it may well be that at some point
    the trial judge would have realized his connection to Mr. Burk and consequently
    recused himself, as he indicated in the conference call.  But, that is not
    what occurred; counsel and client withdrew leaving the trial judge to make
    the only decision that could have been made.</p>

    despite Binnie J.’s statement that he had no recollection of the case, the
    court went on to consider whether there was a reasonable apprehension of
    bias because of a belief that his prior involvement might unconsciously have
    influenced the decision he wrote for the court.  Accordingly, I do not foreclose
    the possibility that in some unusual case the court might set aside a decision
    because of a previously unknown fact that comes to the judge’s attention
    after the case is finished.  As I have said in relation to the recusal motion,
    everything depends on the particular circumstances.  The pivotal circumstance
    here is that by refusing to present her case, the appellant left the trial
    judge with a simple decision that could not, on any theory, have been influenced
    or appear to have been influenced by the unknown fact.</p>

    would conclude with this comment.  Counsel for Mr. Burk was highly critical
    of Mr. Colautti for refusing to accept the trial judge’s ruling.  I agree
    with counsel that it would have been better for the appellant to have accepted
    the ruling, presented the case and, if she lost, to have raised the issue
    on appeal.  Whatever may have been the law in the past, I consider David
