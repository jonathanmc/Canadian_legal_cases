style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of procuring the complainant to become a prostitute
    (x2), living off the avails of prostitution (x2), assault, assault with a
    weapon, aggravated assault, sexual assault, and extortion.  He was sentenced
    to six years in jail on each charge, concurrent, in addition to the equivalent
    of two years pre-trial custody. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial lasted one week.  The complainant testified for three days.  The appellant
    did not testify and called only limited defence evidence that went to collateral
    matters.  The trial judge’s charge to the jury was twelve pages long.  His
    supplemental charge was one page and his responses to questions from the
    jury were brief.  </p>
  <h2><i>The Conviction Appeal</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s charge to the jury in this case gives us serious concern, which
    we believe might often be fatal.  We are not, however, of the view that in
    this case it amounts to reversible error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Our
    view is that in spite of the deficiencies in the trial judge’s instructions,
    in all of the circumstances of this case, the jury’s task was straightforward
    and it would have had no confusion as to the nature and extent of its duties
    and responsibilities.  The jury clearly carefully considered the evidence
    and it asked intelligent questions, which make it plain that this jury had
    no doubt as to what its correct task was.  The trial judge’s charge, while
    not as complete and informative as it ought to have been, nevertheless did
    convey the essence of the jury’s duties and responsibilities to judge the
    facts in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary
    to the assertions of the appellant, this was not a complex trial.  It rested
    entirely on the testimony of the complainant and, therefore, her reliability
    and credibility as a witness.  The theory of the defence at trial was simple;
    that is, the complainant is lying and should not be believed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    appellate counsel now appears to take issue with the extent to which trial
    counsel failed to object to the matters now complained of, he firmly stresses
    the point that competence of trial counsel is not an issue on this appeal.  Accordingly,
    trial counsel’s competence is presumed, and care must be taken by this court
    to appreciate that the trial proceeded in a manner generally acceptable to
    trial counsel. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, therefore, it is important to appreciate that at trial, experienced
    and competent defence counsel is deemed to have been alive to the many issues
    now raised on this appeal.  Indeed, an examination of the record supports
    this.  The trial judge held a pre-charge conference, he addressed objections
    after the charge, and he invited input before answering the jury’s questions.  Counsel
    clearly appears to have decided that the instructions, when considered in
    their entirety, were sufficient. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    all the appellant's grounds of appeal, only <i>Vetrovec</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> was raised at trial.  Subject to one issue of
    no consequence — which we will discuss below — there is no merit to any of
    the grounds of appeal that are of such a magnitude as to warrant a new trial
    in this case.  Some of the more noteworthy grounds of appeal, however, do
    require some brief comment. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    it is our view that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was not required.  The complainant
    had no criminal record, no unsavoury past, and was not a jailhouse informer.  The
    trial judge had wide discretion over whether to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    regarding the complainant’s evidence, his decision is entitled to deference
    and we see no basis on which to interfere with that decision. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on the distinction between
    credibility and reliability, in the circumstances of this case, did not amount
    to reversible error.  The complainant’s evidence does not remotely suggest
    that she misinterpreted the events she complained about.  Indeed, neither
    defence counsel’s cross-examination of her nor the closing arguments to the
    jury made such a claim.  Finally, at no time did defence raise this at trial
    or seek an instruction on differentiating reliability from credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct
    on all of the constituent elements on each of the offences charged.  We would
    first note that it is not the case that no constituent elements were included
    in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  We do, however, agree that
    his charge on the constituent elements of the various offences was not as
    complete as it could have been.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nevertheless,
    failure to instruct on all of a count’s constituent elements is not necessarily
    reversible error: <i>R. v. Abbas Ali Khan</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 32 at
    40-41 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Mohammed</i>, 2007 ONCA 513 at para. 22.  Defence counsel in
    this case gave a thorough and effective closing address that did not contend
    that the complainant’s evidence, if accepted, might not prove one of these
    offence's constituent elements.  Furthermore, she made only a few limited
    suggestions in the pre-charge discussion and did not object to the failure
    to charge more fully on the offences’ constituent elements. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is implicit in defence counsel's closing address that if the complainant’s
    evidence was accepted, the appellant's guilt would be proven.  In this case,
    with the exception of the offence of assault with a weapon, the complainant’s
    evidence, if accepted by the jury, would establish the respective offence’s
    constituent elements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the exception, which is in relation to count 7, the appellant was charged
    with assault with a weapon, namely, a knife.  The Crown concedes that the
    trial judge did not clarify that the weapon with which the appellant was
    charged in the count of assault with a weapon was a knife and not a cigarette.  On
    the facts of this case, an instruction that included the constituent element
    of a knife was essential.  The jury’s verdict therefore on the offence of
    assault with a weapon, namely a knife, cannot survive. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Nevertheless,
      the facts which the jury must have accepted are capable of proving beyond
      a reasonable doubt the included offence of common assault.  The trial judge’s
      instructions were sufficient to support such a verdict.  We, therefore,
      set aside the conviction for assault with a weapon and substitute one of
      common assault.  In all other respects, the appeal against conviction is
      dismissed.</span></p>
  <h2><i>The Sentence Appeal</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the trial judge’s total sentence of six years incarceration in
    addition to a period of pre-sentence custody fixed at two years.  We accept
    that an overall sentence of eight years imprisonment for these offences and
    this offender is fit and proper.  Except for some variation in the periods
    the trial judge assigned to each of the counts —
    which we discuss below — we agree with the total sentence fixed by him as
    well as his reasons for doing so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant in this case carried on a systematic and calculated exploitation
    of an unsophisticated and susceptible young woman.  He did this while on
    parole for living on the avails of a sixteen-year-old victim.  Clearly the
    appellant has no regard for the criminal justice system.  Furthermore, he
    has a significant and relevant criminal record that includes prior convictions
    for living on the avails of prostitution as well as offences of violence
    and dishonesty.  At the time of these offences he was thirty-one-years-old
    with two children.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was a simple sentencing matter that followed a simple trial.  The sentencing
    submissions were short and straightforward.  The period of pre-sentence custody
    was agreed to by both the Crown and defence.  In our view, the trial judge
    applied the correct sentencing principles and gave adequate reasons for a
    total sentence.  Subject to the error discussed below, we see no other error
    on the part of the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge simply assigned six year concurrent sentences for each offence.  It
    was not open to him to do so.  The trial judge incorrectly imposed a six-year
    period of imprisonment for common assault in contravention of the five-year
    maximum.  However, we see this as having no impact on the fitness of the
    total eight-year sentence imposed for all the offences.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would, therefore, set aside the sentencing judge’s assignment of the length
    of imprisonment for the respective offences and substitute those set out
    below.  Thus, in addition to the agreed upon credit for pre-sentence custody
    of two years imprisonment, the appellant’s sentence of periods of further
    incarceration will be amended as follows:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counts
    1 and 4, procuring for prostitution - 3 years each consecutive.</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counts
    2 and 5, living on the avails of prostitution – 3 years each consecutive
    and concurrent with counts 1 and 4. </p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;color:black'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Counts
      3 and 7, assault
    – 1 year each concurrent to each other and to all other counts.</span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Count
    6, aggravated assault – 2 years concurrent.</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Count
    8, sexual assault – 2 years concurrent.  </p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Count
    9, extortion – 2 years concurrent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentence, therefore, while amended by this court, nevertheless confirms the
    total sentence of eight years imposed by the trial judge less credit for
    pre-sentence custody.  In all other respects, while leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all the circumstances of this case, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.  And,
    while we grant leave to appeal sentence, the sentence appeal is dismissed
    subject to the variation recorded in these reasons.</p>
