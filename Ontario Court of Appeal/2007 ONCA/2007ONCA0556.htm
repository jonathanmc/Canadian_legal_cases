style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the evening of February 3, 2001, the respondent and his friends David Coulter,
    Charles Coulter and Becky Parmiter attended a “rave” at The Docks nightclub
    in downtown
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The deceased, Salim Jabaji, was also at the rave.  He was accompanied
    by his friends, Robert Conejeros and Ryan Vandelaar.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    long after arriving at the club, Robert Conejeros and Charles Coulter got
    into a fight.  The first fight was followed by a second altercation between
    Conejeros and Charles Coulter, and possibly others.  The second fight was
    broken up by one of the club’s bouncers, who forced Conejeros to the ground
    and removed him from the club.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after, Salim Jabaji was found to be injured, rushed to hospital and pronounced
    dead.  The autopsy indicated he died of a single stab wound to the chest.  He
    also had a stab wound on his right arm above the elbow, which the pathologist
    explained was consistent with an injury to someone trying to defend himself.  During
    the autopsy, the police found thirty-nine pills of ecstasy divided into six
    small plastic bags sewn into the inside of the deceased’s underwear.  </p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The arrests</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 6, 2001, David Coulter was arrested for the murder of Salim Jabaji and Charles Coulter was arrested for assaulting Robert Conejeros.  The respondent had fled the club and caught up with the Coulters.  He told them that he had been attacked and might have stabbed the aggressor.  Upset that the respondent had not come forward to exonerate his brother, Charles Coulter secretly recorded four telephone conversations in which he asked the respondent to turn himself in.  The respondent explained that he did not want to confess his involvement until he knew the evidence against him.  The respondent was subsequently charged with Jabaji&rsquo;s murder in September 2001 after complying with a police request for a blood sample.  The charge against David Coulter was later withdrawn.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In February 2003, an acquaintance of the respondent, Mark Yang, was arrested on gun-related charges.  Upon his arrest, he provided police with an audiotaped statement in which he implicated the respondent in Jabaji&rsquo;s murder.  (At trial, Yang testified that the statements he made to the police were not true but were based on things he read, heard, and made up.)  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>THE PRE-TRIAL MOTION</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    pre-trial submissions, defence counsel sought to introduce evidence relating
    to the ecstasy pills found on the deceased (the “39 pills evidence”).  He
    submitted that the 39 pills evidence was relevant for the following reasons:
    (1) as part of the “narrative or background” to the evening’s events; (2)
    to help explain the animus between the Coulters and Jabaji; and (3) because
    it may have shown that others had a motive to harm Jabaji.  On this last
    point, defence counsel agreed with the trial judge that the “central” issue
    in the case was identity, and that possession of the pills might assist in
    solving the “mystery” of who perpetrated the crime.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown opposed the admission of the evidence on the basis that it was not
    relevant.  Secondly, at the time of the trial, the respondent also faced
    outstanding charges relating to the trafficking of large quantities of cocaine,
    marijuana, ecstasy and firearms.  The alleged offences occurred after the
    offence in issue here.  The Crown submitted that if involvement in drugs
    was relevant to the identity of the person who killed Jabaji, the evidence
    of the respondent’s involvement with drugs should be admitted.  Thirdly,
    the Crown was concerned that if the jury heard the 39 pills evidence they
    would decide the deceased was less worthy of protection under the law.  Finally,
    Crown also objected to the admission of the evidence on the grounds that
    any probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel stated, “I have no intention of introducing evidence in others, none.”  And, “The
    propensity of third parties for violence is not something I intend to bring
    out.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    judge stated, “If I’m right that by eliciting evidence of the propensity
    of others will trigger the admissibility of your client’s propensity, then
    the jury would hear that your client is alleged to be a gun dealer.  And
    in this particular political climate today, that, I’m sure you will have
    decided, is not something that you want to open up.  That’s not a Pandora’s
    box that you want to open.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel assured the trial judge that he would not use the 39 pills evidence
    to ask the jury to draw inferences about Mr. Jabaji “in the sense that he
    had a violent disposition or was dealing drugs or there was any connection
    between the two.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was obviously concerned about the potential implications of the
    39&nbsp;pills evidence.  He acknowledged that lay people could draw a connection
    between drugs and violence without anyone asking them to do so.  The trial
    judge indicated that if the evidence went in, he would make it clear to the
    jury that to fall into this type of propensity reasoning would be to fail
    to honour their oaths.  “I accept without any reservation the fact that if
    things get skewed to the point where it’s a character attack on someone who
    is not here to defend himself or his reputation (the deceased), that would
    be a terrible miscarriage of justice, no question.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    however, the trial judge ruled that the 39 pills evidence could be admitted.  Although
    he did not explicitly state that the evidence was relevant to motive and
    the identity of the killer, the oral argument on the motion makes it clear
    that the trial judge understood that identity would be the central issue
    in the case.  Before ruling, the trial judge once more asked defence counsel
    to confirm that the position of the defence would be that “ the wrong person
    now sits here charged when the person who actually did [the killing] was
    the one charged in the first place [David Coulter]”.  Defence counsel replied: “Yes
    ,sir, Well, I think that’s fair, yes.”  The trial judge then held that the
    evidence was relevant because it was open to the jury to conclude that ecstasy
    was being consumed at the rave and because evidence of the deceased’s drug
    possession was, at the least, relevant as part of the narrative or background
    facts of the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded his ruling on the admissibility of the 39&nbsp;pills
    evidence by  cautioning: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“There are clear dangers inherent in pointing to
    the propensity of others to commit crimes when the accused himself has a
    similar propensity. … Mr. Hicks is well aware of this line of authorities
    and the principles that underlie them.  He has advised me that he has no
    intention of placing his client’s character in issue during the trial.” [Citations
    omitted].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge stressed that if defence counsel had any doubt about whether
    a particular line of questioning could put his client’s character in issue,
    he should seek guidance.  He cautioned him that “if you don’t and put your
    toe over that line and place your client’s character in issue, you know what
    the consequences will be.”  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>THE TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the trial, the defence sought to call a witness, Ryan Vandelaar.  Vandelaar
    proposed to testify that the deceased “had a temper and would throw the first
    punch” as well as that he had seen a small knife in the glove compartment
    of the deceased’s car about a month prior to the night in question.  He had
    not seen the knife on the night of the stabbing.  The Crown submitted that
    if the defence sought to elicit this evidence to show the deceased’s propensity
    for violence, the Crown would be entitled to respond with evidence of the
    respondent’s propensity for violence.  He also indicated he would like the
    trial judge to revisit two of his earlier rulings, one being the decision
    to admit the of the 39 pills evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    hearing the proposed evidence of Ryan Vandelaar – and hearing the judge’s
    initial assessment that his evidence would be admissible without putting
    the respondent’s character in issue, with the exception of the evidence of
    the knife in the glove box – defence counsel made his submissions.  He argued
    that the knife in the glove box evidence would not raise bad character on
    the part of the deceased and thus did not place respondent’s character in
    issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    hearing defence submissions, the judge again sought clarification on why
    defence wanted the 39 pills evidence admitted.  He asked whether defence
    counsel would ask the jury to infer that the deceased was trafficking in
    drugs.  When defence replied that there was only evidence of possession,
    the judge asked, “isn’t it implicit?”  He further noted that this left “an
    elephant in the room”.  “There’s something there, everybody can see it, but
    nobody talks about it.  So what you’re saying is you’re not going to talk
    to the jury about it, but isn’t it going to be pretty obvious to them what
    your position is?”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    the judge sought clarification from defence counsel about how he wanted to use the 39 pills evidence.  He noted that that if the purpose was to suggest that “it’s more likely that Mr. Jabaji initiated this chain of events and was armed with a knife than Mr. Tuck”, his tentative view was that it would engage the principles in <em>R.
    v. McMillan</em> (1975) 7 O.R. (2d) 750, aff’d [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824 and <em>R.
    v. Parsons</em> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 1. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown, pointing to <em>R. v. Sparkes</em>, [2005] O.J. No. 1883 noted that the principles
    also applied in the context of self-defence cases. He requested that if the
    knife in the glove box evidence was admitted, then the evidence that the
    respondent was a gun dealer should go in or, alternatively &ldquo;knock it
    all out and let [the jury]  decide on objective facts.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown further submitted that defence counsel’s urging would lead to a distorted
    picture for the jury and that the conduct of the defence fell directly within <i>McMillan</i> and <i>Sparkes</i>.  Defence
    counsel replied that <i>Sparkes</i> was not this case.  The Crown replied,
    saying “Well, actually, this case, the way he’s framing it now does fall
    within that realm, Your Honour.  He’s saying if the jury decides it was an
    engagement between Tuck and Jabaji, …. this evidence suggests he’s more likely
    to be the aggressor, that is <i>Scopelliti</i>.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not comment.  Instead, he asked to hear argument on the outstanding
    Corbett application.</p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>The Corbett application</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence had given notice that the respondent intended to testify.  Prior
    to the respondent testifying, the defence sought a ruling that the respondent’s
    criminal record under the then <i>Young Offenders Act</i> be excluded from
    evidence.  Alternatively, the defence sought to have the respondent’s conviction
    for assault causing bodily harm excluded leaving only the conviction for
    mischief.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submitted that the trial judge should not rule on the Corbett application
    in a vacuum but that, prior to ruling on it, the judge should determine whether
    the defence would be seeking to put forward a defence of self&#8209;defence
    and would rely on propensity evidence relating to the deceased.  He further
    submitted that this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Munro</i> [2003] OJ No.
    512 OCA was an example of a case where this court upheld a trial judge’s
    decision to admit evidence of  the accused’s record although the accused
    had not put his character in issue but so that a fair balance would be struck   He
    added:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this case what we have is we already have excluded
    off the table the utterances in the tape [the taped phone conversation with
    Connelly] where he’s pounding somebody at school, his predeliction for selling
    guns.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown continued:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The next issue is this character issue.  If Mr.
    Jabaji’s tendencies as described by Mr. Vandelaar go in, so does the ABH
    (assault causing bodily harm) on a Corbett.  It only comes to the jury if
    he testifies and it only goes in as a conviction, no details.  It’s the least
    possible prejudicial type of evidence they can hear, but it’s the fair line
    to draw, because there’s going to be a great deal made in examination of
    Mr. Vandelaar by Mr. Hicks about how Salim Jabaji, this straight A student
    who was a good guy, had a temper and would throw the first punch.  And you’re
    entitled to consider and Munro mandates it, in my respectful submission,
    that if that’s the case, then the fair line drawn here is to say, well, the
    AB H stays in.  Because otherwise two things happen, you’re cutting his criminal
    record basically in half and you’re creating sort of a reverse propensity
    argument.</p>

    added: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I don’t intend to go into the ABH.  I intend to
    keep it within the confines of the Canada Evidence Act.  But Munro says that
    and so does Sparkes. …It’s not good character on the part of Salim Jabaji
    to say he’s got all that drugs on him that night and he has got a hot temper.  That’s
    bad character, no matter what Mr. Hicks says.  And the proper balancing would
    say that in light of that, any notion that the ABH should be excluded should
    be laid to rest.  … </p>

    the trial judge ruled that he would allow the ABH conviction to go in.  If,
    on the other hand, the defence did not elicit evidence of the propensity
    of the deceased from Vandelaar, then the ABH conviction would not be admitted
    as its probative value would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  The

    respondent then gave his evidence.  He testified that as his friends were
    dispersing following the second fight, he noticed a “big man”, whom we now
    know was Salim Jabaji, staring at him.  The respondent tried to rejoin his
    friends, but the man blocked his way and began yelling at him.  The man then
    produced a knife and held it at shoulder height.  Although he was shorter
    and weighed less than the big man, the respondent testified that he grabbed
    the deceased’s hands and the two wrestled until the respondent got control
    of the knife.  The respondent explained that the baseball cap he was wearing
    got pushed down over his eyes in the course of the struggle.  When the deceased
    allegedly came at the respondent again, the respondent pushed him away with
    both hands.  The respondent testified that he did not realize at that point
    that he had struck the deceased with the knife, nor did he realize until
    later that both his hands had been cut in the altercation.  After fleeing
    the club, the respondent caught up with the Coulters, told them he had been
    attacked and might have stabbed the aggressor.  The respondent testified
    that David Coulter took the knife from him and disposed of it.  The three
    men then fled the club in David Coulter’s car.  The knife was later found
    in the nightclub.  </p>

    the course of giving his evidence, the respondent testified that at the time
    of the incident he was 19 and didn’t know anything about how the law worked.  He
    also testified that when he was younger he had had a run in with the police
    suggesting that the only contact he had with the police was his mischief
    conviction.  In explaining why he did not go to the hospital to have the
    cuts on his hands treated following the stabbing he said he was afraid of

  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Defence Closing</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his closing to the jury, defence counsel stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So, in the final analysis, who smuggled something
    into the Docks on February the 3rd, 2001?  Who do we know for sure smuggled
    something into the Docks?  Salim Jabaji.  He smuggled thirty-nine tabs of
    ecstasy into the Docks, and perhaps more.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thirty-nine tabs of ecstasy is more than one person
    would need for personal use, no matter how late this party went.  <i>Is there
    a hook-up, a link, between drugs and violence more so than say chess and
    violence or reading and violence?</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown immediately objected and asked the judge to instruct the jury that
    they could not consider the 39&nbsp;pills evidence in the manner suggested
    by the defence.  As he put it:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…what’s more troubling to me….is this road that
    Mr. Hicks deliberately went down in his closing saying that drugs and violence
    are connected.  We spent hours of court time dealing with this issue and
    the issue of whether by making such a suggestion he would bring Mr. Tuck’s
    character into issue and the Crown would be able to point out to the jury
    that if that is a legitimate inference to make, the really the person that
    should be hung by it is Mr. Tuck, not Mr. Jabaji, because he’s really a high
    level drug dealer and gun dealer. So I’m very disappointed that was raised.  And
    the only possible remedy that we have now, which Mr. Hicks knows, is an instruction.  I’m
    going to ask you to instruct the jury in very clear terms, in light of this
    unfairness, that that suggestion by Mr. Hicks has no place in this trial
    and they are not to consider it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge responded that he did not want to delay the jury.  Crown counsel
    agreed not to mention it in his closing address and went ahead and addressed
    the jury.  The trial judge then heard submissions from counsel on the propriety
    of defence counsel’s comments. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel maintained that what he had said to the jury was permissible.  He
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It’s a rhetorical question.  I didn’t tell them
    to make that distinction.  I already talked to them about inferences they
    can draw.  And so I can say exactly what I said…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    pressed by the trial judge to explain how he had not have put his client’s
    character in issue if the “suggestion that Jabaji was more likely to be violent
    because he had drugs in his possession”
    had been made during the trial proper, counsel replied that his client had
    a right to make full answer and defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge replied:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Crown counsel] made the point in his submissions
    that we spent a great deal of time talking about what would and what would
    not place Mr. Tuck’s character in issue.  And I have struggled with it from
    the beginning of this trial until the end.  And every one of these rulings
    has gone your way because I know the high cost to Mr. Tuck if I were to hold
    that it places his character in issue.  And you undertook to me that you
    would not place his character in issue and, in fairness to you, you didn’t,
    you were careful, otherwise you would have had a ruling from me that you
    had placed his character in issue.  The objection here is that now that the
    evidence is in…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The lid is on the can.  Now you go to the jury and
    say, hey, folks, don’t forget Jabaji is a drug dealer, isn’t it more likely
    that he had a knife?  I mean, I know you didn’t use that language….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But that certainly was the purpose of your submissions.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Defence Counsel: After I told them that there are
    inferences they can draw and the proper basis upon which they can draw inferences,
    all I said here is somewhere you might want to connect the dots.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court: So perhaps when I asked you if you’re
    going to place your client’s character in issue, the correct answer would
    have been to say not until after all the evidence is in and only when I address
    the jury.  ….The issue before me now is whether I should instruct the jury
    that that submission had no place in the address.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    taking the evening to consider the matter, the judge advised counsel that
    he would not address it by way of instruction to the jury.  He gave two reasons.  First,
    he was of the view that it would
    “simply draw attention to it and create more problems than it will solve” and,
    second, if in the charge, “a judge starts throwing mud at one of the lawyers,
    it can have unfair consequences”.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>iii        failing
    to correct defence’s counsel’s impermissible use of the 39&nbsp;pills evidence
    in his closing address to the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    are of the view that the appeal should be allowed on the basis of the third
    ground of appeal.  Accordingly, we address the first two grounds of appeal
    only in relation to overall fairness of the trial and to the extent necessary
    to give guidance with respect to the conduct of the new trial.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    determining whether the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury
    on the impugned statements, we begin by determining whether the impugned
    statements in defence counsel’s closing address were improper.  Counsel for
    the respondent concedes that if the statements invited propensity reasoning
    on the part of the jury, they would be improper.  However, he submits the
    statements would only have led to the inference that Mr. Jabaji armed himself
    for defensive purposes before entering the club.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the impugned statements carried the implication that the trial
    judge took from them.  They invited the jury to conclude that the deceased
    was a drug dealer and, as such, had a propensity for violence and was more
    likely to be the aggressor.  The statements were clearly improper.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    so concluding, it is important to recall the context within which the ruling
    respecting the 39 pills were made.  At the time of the pre-trial motion in
    which defence counsel asked that the 39 pills evidence be ruled admissible,
    the central issue in the case was understood to be the identity of the person
    who had stabbed Mr. Jabaji.  In admitting the evidence, the trial judge placed
    clear limits on the use that the defence could make of the 39&nbsp;pills
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel assured the trial judge that he would not use the evidence to ask
    the jury to draw inferences about the deceased “in the sense that he had
    a violent disposition or was dealing drugs or there was any connection between
    the two”.  Yet this is precisely what he did in his closing address to the
    jury.  The device of using a rhetorical question to convey his suggestion
    to the jury does not make his comments any the less egregious.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the clear and recognized dangers that the 39&nbsp;pills evidence
    posed, at the time of the Corbett application, the trial judge ought to have
    ascertained whether, as suggested by the Crown, the defence position had
    changed and whether the defence would be seeking to put forward a defence
    of self&#8209;defence.  A fresh determination as to whether the probative
    value of the 39 pills evidence outweighed its prejudicial value and whether
    it was necessary to declare a mistrial was required.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alternatively,
    upon learning that the defence was self-defence, then, despite the protestations
    by the defence, it ought to have been clear that the 39 pills evidence would
    be used as propensity evidence in relation to the deceased.  That was the “elephant
    in the room”, as the trial judge phrased it.  The question was not simply
    whether the defence had put the deceased’s character in issue but whether
    the jury would be left with an unfair impression.  When the respondent took
    the stand and admitted that he had fatally stabbed Mr. Jabaji, the issue
    for the jury had become:  who was the likely aggressor?  The deceased or
    the accused? </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
    v. Rose</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262 at para 126-127, the Supreme Court of
    Canada held that “[i]t is not only appropriate for a trial judge, in a
    charge to the jury, to undertake to remedy any improper address by counsel,
    but it is the duty of the trial judge to do so when it is required.”  The
    Court also stated, “The judge should not hesitate to correct errors of
    counsel in order to preserve the fairness of the trial process.  Taking
    this step will ensure fairness in the vast majority of cases.”  We would
    add that a limiting instruction could have been made without  “throwing
    mud” on defence counsel, as the trial judge feared.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    duty to correct unfair or improper statements made in closing addresses applies
    equally to Crown and defence closings.  In <i>R. v. Finta</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R.
    701, at para. 281, concerns were raised about the prejudicial nature of statements
    made in the defence’s closing.  Justice Cory, writing for the majority, held
    that the statements were improper but found that the judge’s instructions
    had remedied any resulting unfairness.  In so deciding, he explained the
    key role that trial judges play in correcting misstatements or unfairness
    stemming from counsel’s closing addresses:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At the conclusion of a long, difficult and emotional
    trial it is only natural that a jury would turn to a <b>trial judge as the
    impartial arbiter for instructions and directions with regard to the case</b>.  In
    this case their trust was well placed.  The jury received from the unbiased
    arbiter clear, unequivocal directions pertaining to all the improper statements
    of counsel for the accused.  <b>It is those instructions that they would
    hear last and take with them to the jury room and rely upon during the course
    of their deliberations.  The final instructions of the trial judge are rightly
    assumed to be of great significance to the jury</b>.  That is why these directions
    are carefully reviewed by appellate courts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent submits that the trial judge’s charge to the jury remedied any
    impropriety in defence counsel’s closing submissions.  In telling the jury
    the defence position the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The thorough search of Mr. Tuck as recorded on the
    security video.  That Salim Jabaji secreted drugs on his person when entering
    the club.  That supports the inference, in Mr. Hick’s submission, that Mr.
    Jabaji was more likely the one to have carried the concealed weapon into
    the Docks.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree that the unfairness to the Crown was remedied by this passage.  The
    trial judge did not say, as he should have, that the suggestion that the
    deceased had ecstasy on him and was more likely to be violent should be disregarded
    by the jury because it invited them to engage in impermissible propensity
    reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue of who was the likely aggressor was central to the disposition of this
    case and was clearly at the heart of the jury’s deliberations.  Within hours
    of starting to deliberate, the jury asked to have the respondent’s testimony
    read back on (a) how he disarmed the deceased; (b) how far the deceased was
    from the respondent when the respondent first noticed him; and (c) when the
    respondent first noticed the knife.  The jury next sought clarification on
    the criteria for and burden of proof with respect to self-defence, including,
    specifically whether the Crown had to prove that the respondent did not experience
    an unlawful assault by the deceased.  Just over two hours after being recharged
    on this point, the jury returned with its verdict of not guilty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    cumulative effect of the admission of the 39 pills evidence, the exclusion
    of evidence of the respondent’s propensity for violence, defence counsel’s
    impermissible use of the evidence and the trial judge’s failure to take corrective
    action, left the jury with a distorted factual picture on the key issue.  Given
    that the question of who was the likely aggressor was absolutely central
    to the jury’s decision, the Crown has met its burden of showing that the
    verdict would not necessarily have been the same had these errors not occurred.      </p>
