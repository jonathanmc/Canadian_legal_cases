  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>OVERVIEW </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By order dated September 25, 2006, Quinn J. declared
    that, pursuant to section 192(1) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (the “Act”), GMAC Leaseco Limited, as
    owner of a truck, is vicariously liable for the negligent operation of the
    truck by John J. Simon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC appeals.  Under the terms of the lease agreement between it and Mr.&nbsp;Simon, Mr.
    Simon was expressly prohibited from driving the truck.  In light of that provision, GMAC argues that
    it did not consent to Mr. Simon’s possession of the truck and, therefore, s.
    192(1) does not apply.        </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the appeal.  Section 192(1) of the Act imposes vicarious
    liability on a vehicle owner for damage caused by the negligent operation of
    the vehicle when it is in the possession of another person with the owner’s consent.  The case law establishes that consent to
    possession of a vehicle is not synonymous with consent to operate it.  Public policy considerations reinforce the importance
    of maintaining that distinction.  In the
    instant case, GMAC owned the vehicle in question and leased it to Mr.
    Simon.  That is, it gave Mr. Simon control
    of the vehicle and consented to his possession of it.  Consequently, even though Mr. Simon was an
    excluded driver and expressly agreed not to operate the vehicle, s.&nbsp;192(1)
    operates to impose vicarious liability on GMAC.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal arises from a single-vehicle
    accident.  On March 3, 2000, Mr. Simon was
    driving a leased truck when it struck a guardrail and rolled over.  The respondents, Tracy Finlayson and Robert
    O’Connor, were front-seat passengers in the truck; both were injured in the
    accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC owned the truck that Mr. Simon was driving
    at the time of the accident.  It had leased
    the truck jointly to Mr. Simon and Teresa M. Jefferies pursuant to a lease
    agreement dated August 29, 1997 (the “Lease”).  The truck was insured under a policy of insurance issued by the
    Economical Mutual Insurance Company (the “Policy”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 18 of the Lease prohibited Mr. Simon and
    Ms. Jefferies from permitting “drivers excluded or restricted under [the Policy]”
    from driving the leased vehicle.  As a
    condition of the insurer providing coverage, Mr. Simon and Ms. Jefferies signed
    an excluded driver endorsement which identified Mr. Simon as an excluded driver
    and expressly excluded insurance coverage if he drove the truck.  Both Mr. Simon and Ms.&nbsp;Jefferies signed
    an acknowledgement to that effect.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents issued a statement of claim in
    which GMAC, as owner and lessor of the vehicle, was named as the defendant.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC brought a motion under rule 21.01(1)(a) of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to determine
    before trial whether, as a question of law, it is vicariously liable for Mr.&nbsp;Simon’s
    negligence in the operation of the vehicle, pursuant to s. 192(1) of the Act.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>192. (1)  <i>The owner of a motor vehicle or street car
    is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in
    the operation of the motor vehicle or street car on a highway unless the motor
    vehicle or street car was without the owner’s consent in the possession of some
    person</i> other than the owner or the owner’s chauffeur, and the driver of a
    motor vehicle or a street car not being the owner is liable to the same extent
    as the owner.   [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge considered two questions when
    deciding the matter:  (1) did GMAC
    consent to Mr. Simon having possession of the truck; and, (2) could GMAC
    contract out of s. 192(1).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the first question, the motion
    judge began by observing that, on the plain wording of s. 192(1), it is the vehicle
    owner’s consent to another person’s possession – not operation – of the vehicle
    that triggers its application.  He stated
    that while possession and operation are not necessarily synonymous, it is not
    possible to be in operation of a vehicle without being in possession of it.  On that basis, he concluded that in the
    circumstances of this case, the words “possession” and “operation” in s. 192(1)
    were synonymous.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge then noted that in accordance
    with s. 18 of the Lease, Mr. Simon was not permitted to drive the truck “which
    is another way of saying that he was not to be in possession” of the truck.  Accordingly, he held that GMAC had not
    consented to Mr.&nbsp;Simon having possession of the truck.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, on the second issue, the motion judge held
    that GMAC could not contract out of s. 192(1).  Consequently, he declared GMAC to be vicariously liable for Mr. Simon’s
    negligence pursuant to that provision.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC appeals.  The essence of its position on appeal is that the motion judge was correct
    in concluding that it had not consented to Mr. Simon’s possession of the
    vehicle but erred in holding that s. 192(1) applied.  GMAC contends that it never consented to Mr.
    Simon’s possession of the truck and that s. 192(1) of the Act does not apply.  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In deciding this appeal, it is necessary to
    determine whether:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>1.         Mr. Simon was
    in possession of the truck with GMAC’s consent, </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the motion judge erred in holding
    that GMAC did not consent to Mr.&nbsp;Simon’s possession of the truck.  As I explain below, pursuant to s. 192(1), if
    an owner gives a lessee possession of a vehicle that may be driven on a
    highway, even if the lessee is expressly prohibited from operating the vehicle,
    the owner remains vicariously liable for any damages that are suffered as a
    result of the negligent operation of the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Recall the wording of s. 192(1):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>192. (1)  <i>The
    owner of a motor vehicle or street car is liable for loss or damage sustained
    by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle or
    street car on a highway unless the motor vehicle or street car was without the
    owner’s consent in the possession of some person</i> other than the owner or
    the owner’s chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle or a street car not
    being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.   [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On a plain reading of s. 192(1), a vehicle owner
    is liable for the negligent operation of the vehicle on a highway unless the
    vehicle was in another’s possession without the owner’s consent.  There is no question but that vicarious
    liability pursuant to s. 192(1) of the Act is based on possession, not
    operation, of the vehicle.  See <i>Thompson v. Bourchier</i>, [1933] O.R. 525
    (C.A.) and the long line of cases in which it has been followed.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The policy underlying the imposition of vicarious
    liability through s. 192(1) was articulated by this court in <i>Thompson v. Bourchier</i>.  In that case, a lease agreement stipulated
    that the leased automobile was not to be operated by anyone other than the
    lessee or his employee.  The lessee
    allowed another person to drive the vehicle.  As a result of that person’s negligent operation of the car, the plaintiff
    was injured.  The owner argued that it
    was not vicariously liable because, contrary to the terms of the lease, the
    automobile had been in the possession of someone other than the lessee.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court rejected that argument.  It held that the owner was liable pursuant to
    s.&nbsp;41 of the Act, the predecessor provision to s. 192(1).  At 527 – 28, Fisher J.A., writing for the
    court, stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think it must be conceded that the object of the
    Legislature in enacting Sections 41 and 41(a) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>was to protect the public by imposing upon the
    owner of a motor vehicle the responsibility of careful management thereof and
    of assuming the risk of those to whom he entrusted possession that they would
    observe the law, and that if they failed in the discharge of that duty, the
    owner - using the words of the statute – would be responsible “for all losses
    and damage sustained in the operation thereof”.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The question here is,
    can the owner of an automobile escape the liability imposed by Section 41(a)
    simply by providing in an agreement of hire that the hirer alone shall retain
    possession and operate the car?  In this
    case the owner parted with possession and control of his automobile under the
    higher contract, and left it entirely to Lupson to live up to its terms, and if
    the owner’s contention “that he did not know Brown had possession and was
    driving and that he did not give his consent to Brown to operate the car” is
    right and an effective answer to Section 41(a), then the object of the statute -
    the public – has no protection, because a hirer, as soon as he is away from the
    owner – having possession and control – can, if he desires, abandon the car, or
    hand the automobile over to an intoxicated or partially intoxicated driver, or
    to one who has little or no experience in driving, and that if some person is
    killed or seriously injured, the owner is immune from liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the above-quoted passage makes clear, s.
    192(1) is intended to protect the public by imposing, on the owner of a motor
    vehicle, responsibility for the careful management of the vehicle.  Possession is one of the rights of
    ownership.  An owner has the right to
    give possession of the vehicle to another.  But, s. 192(1) encourages owners to be careful when exercising that
    right by placing legal responsibility on them for loss to others caused by the
    negligent operation of the vehicle on a highway.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In explaining why s. 192(1) of the Act applies
    to fix GMAC with vicarious liability in this case, it is useful to consider first
    whether Mr. Simon was in possession of the truck and, then, whether GMAC had consented
    to his possession of it.  </p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none'>Possession</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is important to keep separate the notions of possession
    and operation.  Possession is a question
    of law whereas operation of a vehicle is a question of fact.  One person, such as an owner or lessee, may
    have possession of a vehicle but another person may operate the vehicle    Accordingly, I do not agree with the motion
    judge when he stated that “it is not possible for a person to be in operation
    of a vehicle without being in possession” of it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    vehicle because he was permitted to control its use.  Thus, even though by the terms of the Lease Mr.
    Simon was prohibited from driving the vehicle, he remained a lessee of the
    vehicle and, as such, in possession of the vehicle even when he was operating
    the vehicle in breach of the lease terms. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are numerous cases decided under s. 192(1)
    and its predecessor sections in which a person other than the one to whom the
    owner gave possession, negligently operated the vehicle and caused damage.  The owner has been held vicariously liable
    because the owner consented to possession of the vehicle.  <i>Donald
    v. Huntley Service Centre Ltd. </i>(1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 257 (H.C.J.) serves as
    a useful example as its facts are similar to those in the present case.  In the <i>Donald </i>case, parents gave their son possession of a car but forbade him from
    driving it.  The son’s licence had been
    suspended but his parents permitted him to use the vehicle by having his
    friends drive him.  When the son drove
    the car and, through negligence, caused damage, his parents were held
    liable.  The son had the possession of
    the car with his parents’ consent; accordingly, his parents were held
    vicariously liable even though he had been forbidden to drive the vehicle. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In cases where the vehicle has been leased, the
    owner has been held vicariously liable even where the operator was driving the
    vehicle in contravention of the lease terms.  For example, in <i>Fisher v. Harvey
    Krotz Ltd. </i>(1984), 26 M.V.R. 32 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), a rental agreement
    stipulated that the operator of the vehicle was to be twenty-five years of age
    or older and properly licensed to operate the vehicle.  The lessee allowed an under-aged and unlicensed
    driver to operate the vehicle.  In an
    action against the lessor for the negligence of the operator, this court held
    that while the rental agreement might restrict who may operate the vehicle, the
    agreement did not absolve the lessor of its vicarious liability pursuant to s.
    192(1).  I see no reason to find
    otherwise in this case simply because the prohibited driver was also the
    lessee.  </p>

    Mr. Simon’s possession.  The answer to
    that must be “yes”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC entered into the Lease with Mr. Simon.  It was the Lease that gave Mr. Simon
    possession of the vehicle.  Therefore,
    GMAC consented to his possession of the vehicle.  It is true that GMAC did not consent to Mr.
    Simon’s operation of the truck and that by the terms of the Lease, Mr. Simon
    was expressly prohibited from operating the truck.  However, as already discussed, possession and
    operation are not the same thing, in law.  GMAC consented to Mr. Simon’s possession of the vehicle; it did not
    consent to his operation of it.  Breach
    of conditions placed by the owner on another person’s possession of the
    vehicle, including those relating to who may operate the vehicle, do not alter
    the fact of the second person’s possession.  See, for example, <i>Thompson v. Bourchier</i>; <i>Sked v. Henry </i>(1991), 28 M.V.R. (2d)
    234 (Ont. Gen. Div.) and <i>Henwood v.
    Coburn</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 295 (S.C.J.)       </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It will be apparent that I reject GMAC’s
    contention that what occurred was no different than if a third party had stolen
    the truck and had the accident.  In my
    view, the two situations are very different.  An owner cannot be said to have consented to a third party’s possession
    of a vehicle when the third party has stolen it.  In the present case, however, GMAC
    voluntarily gave Mr. Simon possession of the truck. GMAC had the power to
    decide whether to enter into the Lease and give Mr. Simon possession and
    control of the truck.  To echo the sentiment
    expressed by Fisher J. A. in <i>Thompson v.
    Bourchier</i>, above, GMAC cannot escape the liability imposed by s. 192(1) simply
    by providing in the Lease that the lessee was prohibited from operating the
    vehicle.    </p>

    Ontario courts have
    consistently held that an owner’s statutory liability, enacted for the

    leased vehicle and is liable accordingly.  If Mr. Simon’s operation of the vehicle was in contravention of the
    terms of the Lease, GMAC may have a breach of contract claim against him.  However, GMAC cannot rely on the lease to avoid
    its statutory obligations in respect of the respondents.  The respondents are not to be denied the
    benefit of s. 192(1) simply because Mr. Simon breached his contractual
    obligation to GMAC. </p>
