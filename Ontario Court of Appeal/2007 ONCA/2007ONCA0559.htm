    arising out of the insolvency of Teleglobe Inc. (“Teleglobe”).  The defendants

    of the former directors of Teleglobe itself.  The action by the plaintiff/respondent

    to show that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was not the convenient forum for the trial of the action. They argue
    that the motion judge ought to have required the respondent to show why its

    the Teleglobe affair were being tried in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario on the Superior Court of Justice Commercial List.  They submit that
    this action has little connection to the other Teleglobe litigation and moreover,
    that the real substance of this claim concerns a dispute between two Québec-based
    companies – the respondent BNP and the appellant BCE – over a contract that
    was made in Québec and is governed by Québec law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  Decisions on the issue
    of convenient forum are discretionary. In my view, the motion judge properly
    exercised his discretion. He considered all relevant facts and took into
    account the proper legal principles. Moreover, it was open to him to place
    considerable weight on the existence of the related litigation in

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action arises from the respondent’s participation in one of two loan facilities
    (Credit Facility A and B) that together advanced, by way of a lending syndicate
    (the “Syndicate”), $
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    1.25 billion to Teleglobe.  The respondent was not one of the original members
    of the Syndicate, but in September 2000 took an assignment of a portion of
    Credit Facility A which had been established in July 2000 pursuant to a one-year
    Loan Agreement (Facility A Loan Agreement) with Teleglobe. The Agreement
    was extended for another year in July 2001.  The respondent’s share of Facility
    A was $
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    50 million.  The action against the appellant BCE turns on a letter from
    BCE to the Syndicate in which it agreed to provide financial assistance to
    its subsidiary, Teleglobe, in order to maintain a certain total-debt-to-total
    capitalization ratio.  The respondent claims that BCE breached this agreement.  In
    effect, it is alleged that the appellants caused Teleglobe to adopt a form
    of accounting that artificially enhanced the company’s value by vastly overstating
    Teleglobe’s goodwill.  Had the proper accounting methods been used, the respondent
    argues, BCE would have been required to provide greater financial support
    in accordance with the letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    oppression claim against BCE and the individual appellants, former members
    of the Teleglobe board of directors, focuses on the management and control
    of Teleglobe by BCE and the directors (three of whom were also directors
    of BCE) and involves similar issues to those in the breach of contract claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    and the other actions pending in the Ontario courts were precipitated by
    Teleglobe’s insolvency in April 2002 following BCE’s announcement in Toronto
    on April 24, 2002 that it would no longer provide financial support to Teleglobe.  Teleglobe
    filed for <i>Companies</i><i><span lang=EN-US>’ Creditors Arrangement Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36,</span> protection in May 2002 in the Superior Court
    of Justice Commercial List in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  This action was supported by BCE, which provided debtor-in-possession
    financing to Teleglobe through an affiliate.  BCE has been actively involved
    in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2002, just months after the initiation of the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings,
    the Syndicate members, including the respondent, brought an action (the “Syndicate
    Action”) seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, a finding of oppression against BCE
    (not the individual directors) in relation to the way BCE caused Teleglobe
    to conduct its affairs.  The respondent later withdrew from that action and
    launched the action that is the subject of this appeal.  BCE brought a motion
    to stay the Syndicate Action on the basis that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario courts lacked jurisdiction to try the case and on the basis of <i>forum
    non conveniens</i>.  Farley J. dismissed that motion.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The Syndicate Action raises issues that are similar
    to the issues raised by the action involved in this appeal, although the
    theory of liability is different.  In this action, the respondent principally
    relies upon the BCE letter.  In the Syndicate Action, the plaintiffs assert
    that BCE gave a commitment ensuring that the lenders would be repaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings and the Syndicate Action, two other
    proceedings are pending on the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Commercial
    List.  In February 2003, Teleglobe’s interim receiver commenced an action
    against the appellant directors (the “Redemption Action”).  In that action,
    the interim receiver alleges that the directors permitted Teleglobe to redeem
    certain series of preferred shares notwithstanding that Teleglobe did not
    meet the required solvency tests under the <i>CBCA</i>.  The appellants and
    the respondent have a different view of the relationship of the Redemption
    Action to the action involved in this appeal.  The appellants say the Redemption
    Action has nothing to do with the issues in this action.  The respondent
    submits that the actions raise similar issues in that both concern Teleglobe’s
    true financial state.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan Administrator appointed pursuant to the Teleglobe <i>CCAA</i> Plan commenced
    an action in November 2005 against the appellants and two other persons (the “Administrator
    Action”). That action alleges, among other things, that the defendants arranged
    BCE’s affairs to minimize BCE’s exposure in the event of Teleglobe’s insolvency,
    unilaterally withdrew BCE financial support to Teleglobe, and failed to honour
    a previous financial commitment, and seeks damages for breach of fiduciary
    duty and oppression.  Again, the appellants submit that the issues in that
    action have nothing to do with the claims in the action involved in this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two principal documents that frame the dispute in the action and the <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> issue.  The first document is the Facility A Loan Agreement.  That
    agreement contains several clauses concerning jurisdiction and choice of
    law.  Article 12, upon which the appellants rely, provides that “Each party
    hereto … irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York
    State … and the provincial and federal courts located in Québec” and “irrevocably
    agrees that any legal proceeding against any party hereto arising out of
    or in connection with the Facility A Loan Papers or the obligation shall
    be brought in one of the aforementioned courts”.  There is no dispute that
    as a result of the assignment, the respondent is party to the Facility A
    Loan Papers.  The individual appellants are not.  Nor is BCE.  BCE, however,
    submits that it is entitled to the benefit of Article 12.  Article 12 also
    contains a choice of law clause providing that the governing law is that
    of the
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province of

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    10 of the Facility A Loan Agreement applies in the case of default by Teleglobe
    and provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Arranger (the Bank of Montreal)
    or the Determining Lenders may “exercise any and all other legal or equitable
    rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the Province of Quebec and
    Canada applicable therein, or any other applicable jurisdiction as the Arranger
    shall deem appropriate”.  The respondent relies upon this clause.  It submits
    that this clause gives it the right to bring this action in the court of
    its choice, i.e.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  “Determining Lenders” is a defined term and in short means those
    lenders who collectively hold 51 per cent of the debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other important document is the BCE letter.  It does not contain a jurisdiction
    clause.  The appellants submit, however, that it falls within the definition
    of “Loan Papers” in the Facility A Loan Agreement.  The Agreement defines
    Loan Papers to mean, <i>inter alia</i>, “all agreements, documents, or instruments
    in favour of Arranger … or Lenders … ever delivered pursuant to this Facility
    A [Loan] Agreement … or otherwise delivered in connection with all or any
    part of the Obligation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a dispute about whether this action is barred by the applicable limitation
    period.  This action was commenced in December 2004.  The appellants submit
    that under Québec law the applicable limitation period is three years and
    that for reasons that need not be set out here the cause of action arose
    before 2001.  The respondent submits that even if the three-year limitation
    period applies, the action is not statute barred because the cause of action
    did not arise until April or May of 2002, upon the insolvency of Teleglobe
    and the discovery of BCE’s alleged failure to comply with its obligations.  The
    respondent also relies on the civil law doctrine of “impossibility” to extend
    the limitation period. There is a dispute as the exact meaning of the concept
    of “impossibility” and its similarity to the common law principle of discoverability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of argument of the motion the respondent commenced a protective
    action in Québec that is identical to this action.  For the purpose of the
    motion, the appellants undertook to the motion judge that in the event that
    the action was stayed or dismissed, they would agree that any Québec action
    in respect of the same matters was deemed to have commenced on the date this
    action was commenced <i>i.e</i>. December 2004.  There was conflicting expert
    evidence before the motion judge as to whether a Québec court would be bound
    to accept that undertaking.</p>

    accurately setting out the factors to be considered on a motion to stay an
    action on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, the motion judge dealt
    with the principal contentious issue: whether the exclusive jurisdiction
    clause (Article 12) applied.  He rejected the respondent’s position that
    this issue had already been determined against the appellants by Farley J.
    in the Syndicate Action.  He did not, however, clearly find that the clause
    applied.  Rather, he took the clause as an indication of the reasonable expectations
    of the parties.  As he said at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Although it may be arguable, in view of the interlocking definitions
      and other provisions of the relevant Agreements, whether the exclusive

      I accept the submission of the Defendants that the existence of those provisions

    is a clearly more appropriate forum than the forum chosen by the Plaintiff.”  He
    concluded that the appellants failed to show that Québec was a clearly more
    convenient forum.  The motion judge then appeared to revisit the issue of
    juridical advantage and held that he would be reluctant to stay the Ontario
    action on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens </i>given the ambiguity/uncertainty
    concerning the willingness of a Quebec court to accept the appellant’s undertaking
    as to a deemed commencement date of the Québec protection action.  An
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    appellants submit that the exclusive jurisdiction clause applies to the claims
    against BCE.  It is unclear whether the clause also applies to any action
    against the individual directors that arises out of the affairs of Teleglobe.  For
    a variety of reasons, the respondent submits that the clause does not apply.  Its
    principal submission is that since BCE was not a party to the Facility A
    Loan Agreement, it is not entitled to the benefit of the clause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am prepared to assume for the purposes of these reasons that BCE, at least,
    is entitled to the benefit of the clause and that the principles from <i>Z.I.
    Pompey</i>, <i>supra</i>,  apply.  In that case, the Supreme Court of Canada
    approved the “strong cause test” laid down in <i>The “Eleftheria”</i>, [1969]
    1 Lloyd’s Rep. 237 at 242 (PDAD).  In short, a court is not bound to stay
    proceedings commenced in breach of a forum selection clause.  However, as
    Bastarche J. said, at para. 20, the plaintiff has the burden of satisfying
    the court “that there is good reason it should not be bound by the forum
    selection clause.”  A forum selection clause is not simply one of several
    factors that the judge must take into account in deciding a <i>forum non
    conveniens</i> case.  Rather, the presence of such a clause reverses the
    ordinary burden of proof.  In the ordinary <i>forum non conveniens</i> cases,  the
    burden is on the defendant to show why the stay should be granted.  Where
    a forum selection clause is present,
    “the starting point is that parties should be held to their bargain, and
    where the plaintiff has the burden of showing why a stay should not be granted”: <i>Z.I.
    Pompey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as Bastarche J. points out, at para. 20, forum selection clauses are to be
    encouraged “as they create certainty and security in transaction, derivatives
    of order and fairness, which are critical components of private international
    law … In the context of international commerce, order and fairness have been
    achieved at least in part by application of the ‘strong cause’ test.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the assumption that the forum selection clause in Article 12 of the Facility
    A Loan Agreement applied, the motion judge erred in principle in failing
    to require the respondent to show that there was good cause why the action
    should not be stayed.  In my view, however, if there was an error, it was
    of no consequence.  The “guiding element in the determination of an appropriate
    forum must be principles of order and fairness”: <i>Hunt v. T&amp;N plc</i> (1993),
    109 D.L.R. (4th) 16 at 33 (S.C.C.).  The reasons of the trial judge show
    that order and fairness overwhelmingly favoured
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as the place for trial of this action because the other four proceedings
    were in the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    finding is consistent with the reasonable expectation of the parties.  While
    Article 12 requires that all proceedings be taken in the courts of Québec
    or
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York, the rules changed upon Teleglobe’s insolvency.  In accordance with
    Article 10, the Arranger or the Determining Lenders are entitled to bring
    an action in any jurisdiction as the Arranger deems appropriate.  The respondent
    does not on its own hold 51 per cent of the debt and is therefore not itself
    entitled to the benefit of Article 10. That said, it seems to me that the
    inclusion of this clause is a strong indication that the parties contemplated
    that a jurisdiction other than Québec or
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York could be an appropriate forum for litigation in the case of insolvency.  This
    view is bolstered by the fact that the event that has triggered the selection
    of forum for this action was the choice by the new Teleglobe directors to
    use the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario courts for their <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.  At the time Teleglobe
    was a wholly owned subsidiary of BCE and as indicated BCE was actively engaged
    in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge could rightly find that once this complex proceeding had been
    launched in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, to be followed by the other pieces of related litigation, there
    was every reason to permit this action to also proceed in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Given the other proceedings, which have provided the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario courts with over four years of experience with the Teleglobe litigation,
    there was good cause to permit this action to proceed in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The appellants’ submission that the other proceedings have nothing
    to do with the claim asserted in this action does not bear close scrutiny.  Either
    BCE or the individual respondents are involved in all of the actions.  The
    documents ordered produced in the other actions will be required in this
    action.  Many of the same witnesses will be involved.  The essence of the
    claims in all of the proceedings concerns the management of Teleglobe by
    the defendant directors, several of whom were also directors of BCE, and
    the alleged failure of BCE to comply with its commitments to its subsidiary
    and the lenders.  In particular, although the theories of liability in the
    Syndicate Action and this action are different, they are closely related
    and it would be advantageous for one court to deal with both of them.  BCE
    and the directors are already in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    they are not seriously disadvantaged by having all of the proceedings in

line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge found, there are some advantages to having a Québec court
    deal with this action especially because of the choice of law clause.  But,
    these are sophisticated parties and have the means to provide the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court with the necessary evidence:  see <i>Hunt v. T&amp;N plc</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at p. 33.  Also, I agree with the respondent that the importance of choice
    of law should not be exaggerated.  At least as the action is presently framed,
    legal issues will be relatively less significant in comparison to the factual
    issues such as the application of U.S. GAAP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    time was spent during oral argument about the impact of the limitation period
    issue and what the appellants submit were inconsistent findings by the motion
    judge.  The limitation period factored into the motion judge’s analysis at
    several points.  In finding that the factor of jurisdiction and proper law
    strongly favours Québec as the more convenient forum, he took into account
    the advantage of a Québec judge dealing with the limitation period because
    that issue would be dealt with in accordance with Québec law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue also surfaced in the motion judge’s consideration of loss of juridical
    advantage. He appears to have found that loss of juridical advantage favoured
    Québec because if the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario action was stayed, thereby forcing the respondent to commence an
    action in Québec, the respondent would be outside the three-year limitation
    period for commencement of a personal action.  In considering loss of juridical
    advantage the motion judge again took into account the advisability of having
    a Québec judge deal with issues that would turn upon Québec law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the motion judge considered it significant that the action may be barred
    by the three year limitation period if the respondent had to commence a new
    action in Québec or rely upon the protective action.  He said, at para. 51,
    that he would “be reluctant to stay the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario action” in those circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellants that these various findings seem inconsistent.  In
    my view, however, the apparent inconsistency does not assist the appellants.  Juridical
    advantage, contrary to the finding by the motion judge, was at worst a neutral
    factor and should not have been counted as a separate factor favouring Québec.  On
    the record before the motion judge, the applicable limitation period would
    be decided in accordance with the law of Québec whether the case proceeded
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or Québec.  The respondent gained no juridical advantage with respect
    to the limitation period by commencing the action in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario and likewise, the appellants did not lose any legitimate juridical
    advantage.  There is no suggestion that this was a case of forum shopping
    where a party has sought out a jurisdiction simply to gain a juridical advantage
    rather than by reason of a real and substantial connection of the case to
    the jurisdiction:  see <i>Amchen Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation
    Board)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 at 912.</p>

    motion judge’s comment that he would be reluctant to stay the

    the application to this case of the line of authority holding that a plaintiff

    by suing in one jurisdiction and letting a limitation period run in the appropriate
    forum:  see for example <i>Cortese v. Nowsco Well Service Ltd.</i> (2000),

    motion judge’s allocation of weight among the relevant factors cannot be
    said to be unreasonable. It was not simply that the other actions were in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  There was the fact that because of the choice made by Teleglobe
    to bring the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, the Superior Court of Justice Commercial List now had over four
    years experience with litigation arising out of the Teleglobe collapse.  As
    he said at para. 38, “rulings have been made and orders issued with respect
    to matters such as production of documents which may well be relevant to
    issues in this action and it may be that orders could be made for common
    production of documents in this action and in related proceedings in this
    court and possibly, for common discoveries”.  As well, he noted that this
    action and the related action could be case managed by the same case management
    judge.  This factor is considerably more important than the physical location
    of BNP and BCE, especially given BCE’s substantial presence throughout
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    where there may be issues of an expired limitation period, was also an important
    consideration. Review of the motion judge’s reasons, however, indicates it
    was recognized as such and considered accordingly. It is not for this court
    to second guess his view of the relative weight to be assigned to the factors.</p>
