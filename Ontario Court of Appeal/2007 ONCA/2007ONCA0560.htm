    is an application brought under s. 680 of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i> seeking
    an order directing that a panel of this court review the detention order
    made by Justice Milanetti on December 6, 2006, denying the interim release
    of the applicant pending his trial on a charge of first-degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    September 17, 2002 J.L. was killed.  The applicant and three others were
    arrested on or about July 14, 2006 and charged with first degree murder.  The
    applicant’s bail hearing commenced on November 6, 2006 continued over four
    days, concluding on December 6, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    being a murder charge, the onus was on the applicant to show, on a balance
    of probabilities, why his detention was not justified in light of the criteria
    set out in s. 515(10) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The learned judge found
    that he had failed to satisfy her that his detention was not justified, on
    both the secondary and tertiary grounds set out in that provision of the <i>Code</i>.
    Although much of the emphasis and argument before the court below and before
    me focused on the tertiary ground, given the judge’s findings I must first
    consider her ruling on the secondary ground.</p>
  <h4>Secondary Ground</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    secondary ground is set out in s. 515(10)(b) of the <i>Code</i>.  It  provides
    that detention is justified where it is “necessary for the protection or
    safety of the public, including any victim of or witness to the offence,
    having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood
    that the accused will, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence
    or interfere with the administration of justice”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant had an unenviable record as a youthful offender including four
    incidents of assault, as well as one of each of break and enter, trespass,
    breach of probation and theft.  As an adult he has only a conviction for
    failure to give a breath sample but admitted to regular use of cocaine and
    to driving while under suspension.  Finally, an escalating series of violent
    confrontations, between the applicant and several of his associates on the
    one hand and the victim and his associates on the other, occurred in bars
    and on the streets of two small cities.  Notwithstanding the fact that the
    participants, including the applicant, sustained injuries sometimes requiring
    medical treatment, they were not prepared to cooperate with police investigators
    but were, in effect, committed to “settling scores” in their own way.  The
    circumstances of the offence itself support the finding by the judge that
    the applicant’s involvement with violent behaviour had not abated as an adult.  This
    was further supported by evidence of a further violent confrontation between
    applicant and some of the same adversaries some three years after the murder.
    Additionally, there was credible evidence that two of the potential witnesses
    were concerned for their safety if he were released.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several
    substantial sureties, in the form of family members and the employer of the
    applicant, were proffered as part of a release plan. While the judge found
    that they were honest and law abiding citizens, she also concluded that they
    had been unable or unwilling to exercise any realistic level of control over
    the applicant for many years. Hence she was not satisfied that their involvement
    in the release plan would properly address the secondary ground.  The justice
    carefully considered all of the evidence touching on the secondary ground.  Her
    reasons disclose no arguable error in applying the law to the facts. I am
    satisfied that there is no realistic likelihood that a panel of this court
    would find that she erred in her assessment of the evidence and law in relation
    to the secondary ground.</p>
  <h4>Tertiary Ground</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the justice correctly applied the law in respect of the tertiary
    ground.  In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. Hall</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R 309 as explained by this court in <i>R. v. E.W.M.</i>,
    [2006] O.J. No. 3654 (now <i>R. v. Mordue</i>, the trial having been completed),
    she considered the combined effect of the four factors set out in s. 515(10)(c)
    in order to determine whether it was necessary to deny bail in order to maintain
    public confidence in the administration of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    submitted that the tertiary ground comes into play only in exceptional circumstances
    where all of the four factors set out in s. 515(10)(c) were at the highest
    levels. This would, effectively, limit recourse to the tertiary ground only
    to cases of the most grievous of murders with overwhelming evidence against
    the accused person. In my view, the tertiary ground is not so limited.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    provisions of s. 515(10) apply to all circumstances in which an accused person
    seeks judicial interim release.  While the decision of the Supreme Court
    of Canada  in <i>Hall</i> was made against the background of a heinous murder,
    that fact played no role in the legal analysis leading to the conclusion
    that the tertiary ground set out in s. 515(10)(c) was constitutionally valid.  Nowhere
    in that decision did the court purport to limit application of the tertiary
    ground, as a matter of principle, to only murder charges generally and, further,
    to only the most heinous of murder charges in particular.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    tertiary ground continues to apply to all persons seeking judicial interim
    release, whether charged with relatively minor, non violent offences or whether
    charged with murder. In a practical sense, it will not often be a factor
    in most cases, but as the nature of the offence and surrounding circumstances
    become more serious, the consideration of the tertiary ground will become
    more relevant.  That is not to say that the tertiary ground operates to effectively
    dictate the detention of all persons charged with murder.  Rather, the judge
    must analyze the combined effect of the four factors set out in the subsection,
    as explained in <i>E.W.M</i>., in coming to a determination on the tertiary
    ground.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    charge being murder, counsel did not challenge, in the court below or before
    me, the obvious conclusion that two of the four factors are necessarily assessed
    at the highest level.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    counsel challenged the strength of the case against the applicant. While
    the case may not be straightforward or overwhelming, neither is it weak or
    suspect.  On the basis of the evidence proffered at the bail hearing, I am
    satisfied that the judge accurately characterized the evidence implicating
    the applicant in the murder of the victim as “reasonably strong”.  Future
    developments may strengthen or weaken the crown’s case and if the latter,
    form the basis of a further hearing, as suggested by McMurtry C.J.O. in <i>R.
    v. Boyle</i>, 2006 ONCA M34280 (released December 20, 2006). At this point,
    however, the learned judge’s assessment was accurate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the applicant also took the position that before the court may rely on
    the tertiary ground for detention, there must be “something more” in the
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.  They pointed out
    that in this case there was no evidence of torture or dismemberment and no
    evidence that there was a prevailing sense of community fear or concern arising
    out of the commission of the offence.   Certainly, in <i>Hall </i>the facts
    of the murder were gruesome and there was a level of community fear that
    a murderer was at large.  However, as stated by O’Connor A.C.J.O. in <i>R.
    v. Stevenson</i>, 2007 ONCA 378 at paragraph 7:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view, the
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hall</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R.
    309 does not stand for the proposition that, in the case of a murder charge,
    the surrounding circumstances must necessarily include a level of extreme
    viciousness or elements of torture or mutilation before the tertiary ground
    comes into play.&nbsp; Rather, the justice must consider the circumstances
    of each case to determine whether the applicant has shown that his or her
    detention is not necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of
    justice.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view,  the elements of horror and community fear that were present in
    the <i>Hall</i> case are merely two examples of factors that may be considered
    in assessing the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.  They
    are not the only two factors.  For example, Chief Justice McLachlin pointed
    out, at p. 328 of the <i>Hall</i> decision itself, that “an accused’s implication
    in a terrorist ring or organized drug trafficking might be relevant to whether
    he is likely to appear at trial, whether he is likely to commit further offences
    or interfere with the administration of justice, and whether his detention
    is necessary to maintain confidence in the justice system.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the factors identified in <i>Hall</i>, other cases have identified
    factors such as elements of stalking, ambushing or setting a trap for the
    victim, the domestic nature of the homicide and the motive to dispose of
    a potential witness to a crime as circumstances to be weighed when considering
    the tertiary ground.  Other factors could include gang-related crimes or,
    as exhibited here, circumstances involving an ongoing pattern of openly violent
    behaviour.  This list is not exhaustive and the presence or absence of any
    of these factors is not necessarily conclusive in the analysis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    role of the judge hearing an application for judicial interim release on
    a murder charge must, of course, recognize the constitutional presumption
    of innocence, consider the fact that it is a reverse onus situation and evaluate
    the combined effect of the four factors enumerated in s. 515 (10)(c) in coming
    to a decision on the tertiary ground. The justice did so in this case. She
    considered the combined effect of the four factors, including the strength
    of the prosecution’s case and the circumstances surrounding the commission
    of the offence  in assessing whether it was necessary to detain the applicant
    in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.  I am satisfied
    that there is no reasonable likelihood that a panel of this court would find
    that she erred in her assessment of the evidence and law as relate to the
    tertiary ground.  </p>
