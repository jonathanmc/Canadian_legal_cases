  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    motion requires a consideration of two principles that flow from Part XX.1
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: (i) the authority to suspend a disposition of
    the Board pursuant to s. 672.76; and (ii) the degree of binding authority
    of Review Boards, which has been ascribed to them through our jurisprudence:
    see <i>Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric
    Services)</i>, 2006 S.C.C. 7.</p>
  <h2><i>The Law</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    authority to suspend a disposition of the Board is found in s. 672.76 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.&nbsp; The relevant portions of this section are:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>s. 672.76(1)&nbsp; Any party who gives notice to
    each of the other parties, within the time and in the manner prescribed,
    may apply to a judge of the Court of Appeal for an order under this section
    respecting a disposition or placement decision that is under appeal.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; On receipt of an application made
    pursuant to subsection (1), a judge of the Court of Appeal may, if satisfied
    that the mental condition of the accused justifies it …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b) by order, direct that the application of
    a placement decision or disposition made under paragraph 672.54(b) or (c)
    be suspended pending the determination of the appeal; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    appears to be little judicial consideration of these provisions, and I am
    unable to extract from it any precise test as to how this court is to consider
    and apply the suspension provisions.  Nevertheless, a brief review of some
    of the jurisprudence provides valuable insight into how a judge of this court
    should approach a motion brought under s. 672.76.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In

    ) Griffiths J.A. viewed s. 672.76 as granting a judge of this court the authority
    to “relieve against a board disposition pending appeal where it is in the
    best interest of the accused having regard to his mental condition”.  Justice
    Griffiths also offered some additional important principles for judges to
    consider for applications under s. 672.76. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate compelling reasons to doubt the
    validity or soundness of the Board’s disposition.  And second, the section
    should only be invoked in extraordinary circumstances.  I concur completely
    with these additional principles. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Penetanguishene
      Mental Health Centre v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 187 (Ont.

    ), Osborne A.C.J.O. had occasion to consider
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Conway</i>.  He was of the opinion that the main purpose of s. 672.76 “is
    to suspend dispositions in light of changes in circumstances which may, pending
    an appeal, make compliance with the earlier disposition inappropriate”.  He
    went on to conclude that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Before suspending a disposition, the court must
    be satisfied that the mental condition of the accused justifies it (s. 672.76(2)).&nbsp; The
    burden of persuasion lies with the moving party, in this case the hospital
    Administrators and the order is discretionary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would only part company with this conclusion by saying that, in my opinion,
    s. 672.76 is not limited to “changes in circumstances”.  I do agree that
    the focus of the inquiry on any such motion is the mental condition of the
    accused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the few authorities to this point are very helpful, in my view, the degree
    of analysis is now more involved when a more fulsome consideration is given
    to the legislation and to more recent legal authority.</p>
  <h2><i>            My View of the Proper Approach</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    672.76 must be understood in the context of the purposes of Part XX.1 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  One purpose is that review boards are authorized
    to assess and manage the risk to public safety represented by certain accused
    persons.  They then craft appropriate disposition orders, which protect society
    and facilitate the medical treatment of the accused person, while restricting
    that person’s liberty as little as possible: <i><span
style='color:black'>Mazzei</span></i><span style='color:black'>,</span> at para.
    8.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is also the case that review boards generally have the jurisdiction to make
    orders and conditions binding on persons other than the accused person.  The
    orders and conditions by review boards are binding on directors, as well
    as the treatment teams and hospital administration: <i><span
style='color:black'>Mazzei</span></i><span style='color:black'>,</span> at para.
    18. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    must therefore be the case that when deciding an application under s. 672.76,
    the hearing judge must do so in the context of the whole of Part XX.1, the
    specific provisions being considered, and the extent of the authority of
    the Board.  That is to say, the mental condition of the accused; the protection
    of the public; facilitation of the treatment of the accused person; the requirement
    to restrict his liberty as little as possible; and, the authority of the
    Board to make the binding order it did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the foregoing, it is readily apparent why an applicant under s.
    672.76 must put forward compelling evidence to demonstrate that this is one
    of the extraordinary cases in which the Board’s disposition, in all the circumstances
    ought to be suspended pending the appeal.  In sum, I generally agree with
    the earlier pronouncements of judges of this court and, in my view, they
    demonstrate the proper approach to be taken in deciding motions under s.
    672.76, which is something different than that usually applied in staying
    a judgment pending an appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Put
    simply, motions under s. 672.76 should only be granted in extraordinary or
    rare circumstances; there must be compelling evidence adduced by the moving
    party that demonstrates that the Board’s decision — given the mental condition
    of the accused person — is unsound or invalid; and, the onus is on the moving
    party to establish these necessary requirements.  It is in this context that
    I will decide this motion.</p>
  <h2><i>Application to this Case</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    position of the parties before the Board was: Mr. Rogers sought an absolute
    discharge, while the Crown, NEMHC, and the Oak Ridge Mental Health Centre
    all sought a detention order, maximum security at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge.  Included in the evidence was testimony from Dr. McDonald of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board unanimously found that Mr. Rogers poses a significant risk to the safety
    of the public.  However, it went on to hold that he did not require detention
    in a maximum secure facility.  This was based largely on evidence that Mr.
    Rogers managed for six months — immediately prior to the hearing — in a correctional
    facility without treatment.  Mr. Rogers was, therefore, ordered detained
    in the medium secure unit at NEMHC. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>NEMHC
    has launched an appeal and contends that the Board’s disposition was in error.  The
    essence of the appeal is that “the Board disregarded the evidence at the
    hearing to the effect that the accused is potentially too dangerous and assaultive
    to be safely managed in a medium secure facility at the present time”.  In
    other words, the Board simply got it wrong.  Pending the hearing of the appeal,
    NEMHC has brought this motion seeking to have Mr. Rogers transferred to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of the motion, NEMHC filed affidavits of Dr. Susan Adams and Dr.
    Angus McDonald.  Dr. Adams is the psychiatrist-in-chief of NEMHC and Dr.
    McDonald is Staff Psychiatrist with the Forensic Division,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge.  Both doctors share the view that Mr. Rogers poses a risk to the
    safety of others, which is best managed at a maximum security facility.  In
    my view, this is not compelling evidence; it does not demonstrate that this
    is the extraordinary case where the relief sought should be granted; and,
    MEMHC has not met its onus. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    circumstances described by the evidence, while perhaps amounting to more
    detail, are no different than those that were squarely before, and considered
    by the Board when it ordered the disposition it did.  Indeed, as I have noted,
    Dr. McDonald’s opinions about Mr. Rogers formed part of the evidence the
    Board took into account.  It is worth noting that the Board was alive to
    the concerns now being expressed on this motion.  The Board’s concluding
    response is worth repeating:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Board is mindful of the fact that Mr. Rogers
    may experience difficulties integrating into the milieu of the open ward
    at the medium secure level.  If the evidence presents that Mr. Rogers behaviour
    can not be managed within the medium secure unit it will be open to the Hospital
    to seek an early Board hearing to review his level of security.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence on this motion respecting the mental condition of Mr. Rogers is
    also the same as it was before the Board.  I can find no basis from this
    evidence to conclude that his mental condition justifies a result different
    from that found by the Board.  Accordingly, the motion must be dismissed.</p>

    to the order of MacFarland J.A., Mr. Rogers was transferred to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge pending the hearing of this motion.  On August 2, 2007 I reserved
    my decision in this matter and continued the order of MacFarland J.A. until
    further order of this court.  Given my decision, Mr. Rogers will now be ordered
    returned to NEMHC in accordance with the disposition of the Board.</p>

    way of separate order, I granted the Board Intervenor status for this motion
    and all subsequent proceedings on consent of all the other parties.  The
    Board has undertaken to provide very narrow submissions, it will not duplicate
    arguments of the other parties, and it will not argue the merits of the decision
    subject of these proceedings.</p>
