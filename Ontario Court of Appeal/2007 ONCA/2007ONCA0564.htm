    February 8, 2006, McIsaac J. ordered costs to be paid by Honda to Keays in

    September 29, 2006, a majority of a panel of the Court of Appeal reduced
    the punitive damages to $100,000.  The court also reduced the costs award.  Otherwise
    the trial judgment remained intact.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

  <h2>The Motion for a Stay</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, Honda moves to stay the execution of the order of the Court
    of Appeal pending the appeal and cross-appeal pursuant to s. 65(1)(d) of
    the <i>Supreme Court Act</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On filing and serving the notice of appeal and depositing
    security as required by section 60, execution shall be stayed in the original
    cause, except that</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)       where the judgment appealed from directs
    the payment of money, either as a debt or for damages or costs, the execution
    of the judgment shall not be stayed until the appellant has given security
    to the satisfaction of the court appealed from, or of a judge thereof, that,
    if the judgment or any part thereof is affirmed, the appellant will pay the
    amount thereby directed to be paid, or the part thereof with respect to which
    the judgment is affirmed, if it is affirmed only with respect to part, and
    all damages awarded against the appellant on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>As a matter of practice, the Supreme
    Court does not require the $500 deposit contem-plated by s. 60 of the <i>Supreme
    Court Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Honda’s
    position is that a stay of execution should be granted because Honda can
    satisfy the court that if the order of the court or any part thereof is affirmed,
    Honda will pay the amount directed to be paid to the respondent.  In support
    of its position, Honda has provided an undertaking to pay any amount that
    the Supreme Court determines is owed by Honda to the respondent.  Mr. Joe
    Sperduti, the General Manager Administration of Honda, filed an affidavit
    in which, <i>inter alia</i>, he deposes that Honda has been producing vehicles
    at its plant in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Alliston,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario since November 1986 where they currently employ 4,600 associates
    and produce 390,000 vehicles each year.  Honda’s accumulated investment in
    the Alliston facility is valued at over $2.4 billion.  Mr. Sperduti further
    deposes that Honda is well able to pay the amount of the order and costs
    awarded against it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Keays neither challenges Honda’s undertaking nor the evidence which supports
    the viability of the undertaking.  However, counsel for Keays submits that
    in order to obtain a stay under s. 65(1)(d) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i>,
    the applicant must satisfy the three part test in <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald v.
    Canada (A.G.)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311.  According to the three part test,
    an applicant must establish that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    is a serious question to be tried;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> irreparable
    harm will result if the relief is not granted; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    balance of convenience favours the applicant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Keays argues that, although leave to appeal has been granted, Honda’s
    appeal is unlikely to succeed, that Honda cannot establish irreparable harm
    and that the balance of convenience favours the respondent.  In the latter
    respect, counsel for Keays has filed unchallenged affidavit evidence that
    he is impecunious.  He lives on a disability pension of approximately $900
    a month and support from his family.  At the time of filing the affidavit
    evidence for this motion, he had approximately $17 in his bank account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Keays submits that s. 65(1)(d) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i> does not
    grant an unconditional or automatic stay of execution and must be read together
    with s.&nbsp;65(4) of the Act which provides: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court, the court appealed from or a judge of
    either of those courts may modify, vary or vacate a stay of execution imposed
    by subsection (1).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent further submits that by reading s. 65(1)(d) and s. 65(4) together
    and applying the three part test in <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald</i>, the court would
    be justified in granting a partial stay of execution to the extent of approximately
    one-half the value of the appeal judgment, including one-half of the costs
    award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Honda submits that s. 65(1)(d) modifies the common law test for granting
    a stay application where leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada has
    been granted.  In this regard, he relies upon the <i>obiter dicta</i> of
    Low J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Lee v. Dawson</i>,
    (2006), 269 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>th</span>)
    390 (C.A.) at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 65(1)(d) is a statutory variation of the
    common law found in <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald</i> and other cases.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>It should be noted that the application
    before Low J.A. was a motion for a stay pursuant to s. 65.1(1) of the <i>Supreme
    Court Act</i>, brought prior to leave to appeal being granted by the Supreme
    Court.  Low J.A. held that under that section of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i>,
    the <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald</i> three part test applies.  The common law remains
    applicable pending determination of a leave to appeal application; once leave
    to appeal is granted, s. 65(1)(d) becomes the appropriate test.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Honda also relies upon this court’s judgment in <i>Beals v. Saldanha</i>,
    (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 641 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In that case, the court was dealing with a motion to stay the execution
    of a judgment of the Court of Appeal where leave to appeal to the Supreme
    Court had been granted.  The court found that the Lawyers’
    Professional Indemnity Company’s irrevocable guarantee of $1 million was
    satisfactory security for the purpose of s. 65(1)(d) of the <i>Supreme Court
    Act</i>.  The court granted the stay without considering the <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald</i> factors
    such as hardship or balance of convenience.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Honda submits that s. 65(4) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i> has no application
    at this stage.  It is a saving provision to be invoked only if the circumstances
    under which a stay was granted should change, such as the death or insolvency
    of a person who may have given an undertaking to pay the damages.  </p>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the plain language of s. 65(1)(d) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i> leads
    to no other conclusion than that an applicant for a stay of execution of
    a judgment in which leave to appeal has been granted and a notice of appeal
    has been filed and served, is entitled to a stay if he or she gives security
    to the satisfaction of a judge of the court appealed from.  It is unnecessary
    to meet the requirements of the <i>R.J.R.-MacDonald</i> three part test.  In
    this case, I am satisfied that the undertaking given by Honda satisfies the
    requirements of s.&nbsp;65(1)(d).  Honda is a company of considerable substance
    with assets that can easily satisfy any judgment in favour of Keays.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    found that Honda has satisfied the requirements for a stay under s.&nbsp;65(1)(d)
    of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i>, I ask myself the question: am I entitled
    to modify, vary or vacate the stay of execution under s. 65(4)?  A narrow
    reading of s. 65(1)(d) and s. 65(4) would suggest that the two sections taken
    together limit the court’s jurisdiction to modify, vary or vacate a stay
    only to a change of circumstances under which the stay was granted.  However,
    I am persuaded that the language of s. 65(4) is sufficiently broad to permit
    me to vary the stay in appropriate circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    deciding whether I should vary the stay, I would apply the test which this
    court has used under rule 63.01(5) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, which provides: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A judge of the court to which the appeal is taken
    may order, on such terms as are just, that the stay provided by subrule (1),
    (3) or (4) does not apply.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Although the language of rule 63.01(5)
    is different than the language of s. 65(4) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i> and
    although rule 63.01(5) relates to automatic stays, I think the basis upon
    which this court has lifted a stay under that rule can usefully be applied
    under s.&nbsp;65(4) of the <i>Supreme Court Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test for lifting a stay used by this court involves the balancing of three
    principal factors:</p>

    respect of the first factor, I am satisfied that the respondent has made
    out a significant case for financial hardship should the stay not be lifted.</p>

    respect of the second factor, it appears very unlikely that Keays would be
    able to repay or provide security for any amount paid to him.  </p>

    respect of the third factor, the merits of the appeal, I was not provided
    with a list of the grounds of appeal.  However, I was advised that in Honda’s
    application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, no attack was made
    on the quantum of wrongful dismissal damages.  As to the issue of liability
    for wrongful dismissal, this finding is based on findings of fact made by
    the trial judge which are subject to appellate review on the basis of palpable
    and overriding error – a very difficult standard to meet.  The Court of Appeal
    has already found that the evidence at trial supported the finding of wrongful
    dismissal.  </p>

    also raises an issue of reasonable apprehension of bias by the trial judge
    and complains, <i>inter alia</i>, about independent research the trial judge
    carried out on the internet and other issues related to the conduct of the
    trial.  In respect of these issues, the best that Honda could hope for is
    a new trial.  </p>

    balancing the three factors and also taking into account that the short term
    needs of Keays are relatively modest, I would lift the stay granted under
    s. 65(1)(d) of the Act to the extent necessary to meet those needs pending
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not disposed to lift the stay in respect of the punitive damages which
    are not compensatory.  I also would not lift the stay in respect of costs.  It
    was argued before me that counsel for Keays were at some significant disadvantage
    because they are not receiving funds to cover fees and disbursements from
    their client as the litigation progresses.  I am not persuaded by this argument.  No
    specific examples were given to support their position.  Also, I was advised
    that counsel were taking this matter on a contingency fee retainer.  They
    have already been granted a premium on their costs by the Court of Appeal.  If
    they ultimately succeed in the Supreme Court of Canada, the compensation
    to counsel for Keays will be substantial.   </p>
  <h2>Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, a stay is granted pursuant to s. 65(1)(d) of the <i>Supreme Court
    Act</i>.  However, I would lift the stay to the extent of $60,000.  This
    will give Keays $5,000 a month for twelve months (more than five times what
    he presently receives by way of disability pension), which should alleviate
    his financial hardship for the period of time leading up to the appeal and
    for a reasonable period of time after the appeal is argued and the decision
    is under reserve.</p>
  <h2>Costs of the Motion </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    view of the fact that counsel for Keays was requesting an order that Honda
    pay his client $441,300 (an unrealistic sum), I think it can fairly be said
    that substantial success was achieved by counsel for Honda.  Counsel for
    Honda does not seek costs and there shall be no order as to costs.</p>
