style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issues in this appeal are whether the trial judge erred in failing to
    find that Mr. Miskiewicz was a fiduciary and erred in finding that he did
    not make unfair use of confidential information.  Mr. Miskiewicz was a very
    successful salesman for the plaintiff at the time that he and Mr. Alves,
    another employee of the plaintiff, set up their own company.  The trial judge
    found, however, that Mr. Miskiewicz was not in a fiduciary relationship and
    did not make use of confidential information.  The appellant submits that
    the trial judge erred in three respects.  First, she failed to take into
    account the evidence that two weeks before he left, Mr. Miskiewicz took some
    telephone messages while telling a fellow employee that they were worth a
    million dollars.  Second, she misapprehended the evidence as to the appellant’s
    power to set prices.  Finally, she failed to find that Mr. Miskiewicz was
    a key employee and hence a fiduciary based on the volume of sales for which
    he was responsible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge set out the correct test for finding a fiduciary relationship.  She
    gave comprehensive reasons for why Mr. Miskiewicz was not a fiduciary.  She
    pointed out that he did not supervise any other employees, was not involved
    in corporate decision-making, had no power or ability to guide the affairs
    of the plaintiff, had no hiring or firing authority and in short “never rose
    above the position of salesman”.  Rather, he was entirely accountable to
    one of the firm’s owners who was responsible for sales.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the facts that were
    relevant to this determination.  In particular, it was open to the trial
    judge to find that Mr.&nbsp;Miskiewicz had little discretion in respect to
    pricing.  Like any salesman, it was part of his job to price the jobs but
    he was bound by the formula that established a fixed amount for overhead.  If
    he made a serious error then he could be charged back for the loss.  This
    was an appropriate factor to take into account in finding that Mr. Miskiewicz
    was not a fiduciary.  It was no more than a factor and that is how the trial
    judge used this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the telephone messages, the trial judge referred to this evidence.  But
    she also drew the inference that Mr. Miskiewicz did not use any confidential
    information to contact customers.  This inference was available on the evidence.  He
    had been dealing with some of these customers for years and the information
    required to solicit their business was not confidential.  Aside from the
    comment attributed to him about the messages being worth a million dollars,
    there was no other evidence to indicate that he used confidential information.  We
    can thus see no basis for interfering with the holding that Mr. Miskiewicz
    did not engage in unfair competition.  The trial judge heard considerable
    evidence as to the nature of the marble fabricating business and the loss
    in sales after Mr. Miskiewicz left the plaintiff’s employment.  She drew
    the inference that
    “as is the case with many other businesses, the ‘commercial relationships
    between contractors and customers in this industry are more a function of
    price and service than the result of personal influence arising out of previous
    business dealings’”.  That was a finding that was open on the evidence and
    severely undercut the plaintiff’s theory of unfair competition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the plaintiff argues that the volume of sales generated by Mr. Miskiewicz
    was so large and since these customers dealt only with Mr. Miskiewicz, it
    was peculiarly vulnerable to the exercise of discretion or power by Mr. Miskiewicz.  However,
    the trial judge found that he had little discretion or power; that he was
    nothing more than a salesman.  While his volume of sales was substantial,
    it accounted for less than forty percent of the total sales and we were not
    referred to any evidence showing that Mr.&nbsp;Miskiewicz had any power or
    discretion different from the other salesmen.  As the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact that
    the business decision to rely so heavily on Mr.&nbsp;Miskiewicz may have
    turned out to be a less than prudent one is not sufficient to brand Mr. Miskiewicz
    as a fiduciary <i>when the other hallmarks of a fiduciary relationship, such
    as the power to make or influence management decisions or set corporate policy,
    are absent.  </i>To find otherwise would mean that every salesperson, regardless
    of his or her position or authority in the business, would have a fiduciary
    duty simply because of his or her success in sales.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and
    disbursements.</p>
