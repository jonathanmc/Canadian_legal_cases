    MediaWorks Inc. (“CanWest”) appeals the order of Justice Lax of the Superior
    Court of Justice dated  November 6, 2006 which dismissed CanWest’s motion
    for a summons to issue under the <i>Interprovincial Summonses Act</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. I.12 to Professor Barbara Mintzes of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia for the purpose of examining her in advance of the hearing
    of an application.  The application is for, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration
    that s. 3(1) of the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i> R.S., c. F-27 is inconsistent
    with s. 2(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  Section
    3(1) of the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i> prohibits the advertising to the general
    public of certain prescription drugs listed in a schedule to the Act.  Professor
    Mintzes is a leading expert on direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription
    drugs.  She is also retained as a litigation consultant by the Attorney General
    in these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Attorney General of Canada (the “AG”) moved to quash the appeal on the ground
    that the order of Lax J. is interlocutory and that we have no jurisdiction
    to hear the appeal.  We reserved our decision on the motion to quash and
    then heard argument on the merits of the appeal.</p>
  <h2>The Motion to Quash</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the AG submits that the order of Lax J. is interlocutory because no <i>lis</i> existed
    between CanWest and Professor Mintzes (who did not appear on the motion)
    and the dismissal of the motion did not finally resolve any issue between
    the only two parties to the litigation – CanWest and the AG.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, we disagree.  In our view, this court’s judgment in <i>Smerchanski
    v. Lewis</i> (1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 370 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) governs in the circumstances of this case.  In <i>Smerchanski</i>, Arnup
    J.A. said at page 377:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…it is my view that the appealability of an order
    is determined by the nature of the order made and not by the identity of
    the successful party.  If a stranger to the action who has been unsuccessful
    in an application made to the trial Judge has an immediate right of appeal,
    it seems to me clear that where the stranger succeeds before the trial Judge,
    the party to the action who failed in the issue with the stranger should
    have an immediate right of appeal.  In short, an order made in an issue between
    a party and a stranger is either appealable or it is not, and if it is appealable,
    the party who lost in the issue has a right of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without
    expressly inviting this court to overrule <i>Smerchanski</i>, counsel for
    the AG submitted that the scope of the reasoning in that case is drawing
    considerable criticism both in legal commentary and in recent decisions of
    this court.  See for example <i>Sun Life Assurance Co. v. York Ridge Developments
    Ltd.</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 4899 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Royal Trust Corporation v. Fisherman </i>(2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 794
    (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Sun
      Life</i>, the court distinguished <i>Smerchanski</i>.  In <i>Sun Life</i>,
      it is clear that an order quashing a subpoena to a non-party was interlocutory
      because it did not finally dispose of the issue between the non-party and
      the party seeking to examine him.  Similarly, in <i>Royal Trust Corp.</i>,
      the court distinguished <i>Smerchanski</i>.  The <i>Royal Trust Corp.</i> case
      turns on its own particular facts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the AG seeks to limit the <i>Smerchanski</i> case to the situation where
    there are opposing positions taken between a non-party and one of the parties
    to the litigation.  In our view, the recent decisions of this court have
    not so narrowed the scope of <i>Smerchanski</i>.  See <i>Morse Shoe (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Ltd. v. Zellers Inc.</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 1524 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Pennington v. Hawley</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 3591 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In <i>Morse Shoe</i>, Zellers and Hudson’s Bay Company appealed an order
    dismissing a motion for the production of documents by a non-party, First
    National Bank of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Boston (“FNB”).  In deciding whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the
    appeal, Austin J.A. said at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear that the order below would be final
    as against FNB and as between FNB and Zellers; the order finally disposes
    of the issue between them.  I am therefore satisfied that this court has
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal notwithstanding that the only opposition
    to the application and to the appeal comes from the plaintiff rather than
    from FNB.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Similarly in <i>Pennington</i>,
    this court held that it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the defendant
    from an order that two limited partners (who were not parties to the proceeding)
    were entitled to vote in the election of a new general partner for the business.  In
    that case, the court said at para. 23:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Nor do we think it necessary to deal at length with
    the issue of whether the Order appealed from is a final order or an interlocutory
    order.  There is authority for the proposition that an order made in a contest
    between a party to a proceeding (Mr. Hawley, here) and someone who is not
    a party (Chalmers and Mr. Huq) is a final order if the order finally disposes
    of the rights of those persons in the issue between them.  That is the case
    here.  <i>It is the nature of the order that determines its characteristics
    as “final” or
    “interlocutory”, not the party who is asserting opposition to it</i>.  See
    Smerchanski v. Lewis (1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 370 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ): Morse Shoe (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Ltd. v. Zellers Inc. (1997) 10 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 390 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    therefore conclude that the order of the motion judge is a final order and
    that CanWest has a right of appeal to this court.  The motion to quash is
    dismissed.</p>
  <h2>The Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge approached her consideration of whether to issue a summons to
    Professor Mintzes in two stages.  In the first stage, she considered the
    application of rule 39.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  In the
    second stage, she considered the application of s. 5(1)(a) and (b) of the <i>Interprovincial
    Summonses Act</i>.  Counsel for CanWest submits that the motion judge made
    three principal errors: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she

    witnesses of his or her choice; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she
    failed to apply the proper test under rule 39.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she
    erred in failing to find that Professor Mintzes’ evidence is necessary for
    the due adjudication of the application and is reasonable and essential to
    the due administration of justice in Ontario pursuant to s.&nbsp;5(1)(a)
    and (b) of the <i>Interprovincial Summonses Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that, as a general proposition, counsel decides whom he or she will
    call as a witness and that it is counsel’s prerogative to do so.  However,
    in the circumstances that obtain here, counsel must first satisfy the requirements
    of s. 5(1)(a) and (b) of the <i>Interprovincial Summonses Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span

    or not it is necessary, in a motion brought pursuant to s. 5(1) of the <i>Interprovincial
    Summonses Act</i>, to consider rule 39.03(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    the case was put before the motion judge and this court on that basis and
    we therefore intend to address the motion judge’s treatment of rule 39.03.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the evidence sought to be adduced from a non-party is relevant, there is
    a <i>prima facie</i> right to resort to rule 39.03(1) as long as the right
    is not exercised in a manner which constitutes an abuse of process.  See <i>Canada
    Metal Co. v. Heap</i> (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 185 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the motion judge referred to the above authority, counsel for CanWest submits
    that she dismissed the motion on the basis that caution must be exercised
    where applying rule 39.03 in the context of expert witnesses.  She cited <i>Niagara-on-the-Lake
    Association of Ratepayers v. The Corporation of the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Niagara-on-the-Lake</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 568 (S.C.J.).  In our view,
    the <i>Niagara-on-the-Lake</i> case has no application to this case and the
    motion judge erred in relying on it in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence which CanWest seeks to obtain from Professor Mintzes is clearly
    relevant and we see no basis upon which to conclude that CanWest seeks to
    use it in a manner that would constitute an abuse of process.  There may
    well be cases where an effort to use rule 39.03 to obtain expert evidence
    could constitute abuse of process but this is not one of them.  We are satisfied
    that CanWest met the test under rule 39.03.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    take a different view of the motion judge’s approach to s. 5(1) of the <i>Interprovincial
    Summonses Act</i>.  The motion judge concluded that other expert witnesses,
    who have filed affidavits in support of the position of the Attorney General,
    will be available for cross-examination by counsel for CanWest.  More than
    one of those witnesses is familiar with the work of Professor Mintzes and
    at least two of them are co-authors with her of academic articles that are
    relied upon by the AG.  The motion judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While the evidence of Dr. Mintzes may assist CanWest
    in the preparation of its s. 1 case, it is neither necessary for the adjudication
    of the proceeding nor essential to the due administration of justice in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    our view, this was a call for the motion judge to make and absent palpable
    and overriding error, we cannot intervene.  There was a basis in the record
    for her to conclude as she did.  No doubt it would be helpful to have Professor
    Mintzes’ evidence, but “helpful” is not the test.</p>
