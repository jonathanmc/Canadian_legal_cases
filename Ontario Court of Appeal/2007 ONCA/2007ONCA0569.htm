style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Steven Gosal, appeals from the order of The Honourable Mr. Justice
    DiTomaso, dated January 25, 2007, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice,
    dismissing his motion to expunge all child support arrears for the period
    December 1, 2001, to September 1, 2005 while he was unemployed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was let go from his position as a vice-president and CFO for a
    small company in 1999 after it was sold.  He was then 50 years of age. &nbsp; While
    experienced in accounting he has neither formal designation nor university
    degree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found that the appellant initially became unemployed through
    no fault of his own. &nbsp;He then went on to find that the appellant’s continued
    lack of employment was self-imposed, that he could have found other work,
    and that he chose not to work for four years allowing the child support arrears
    to grow without ever intending to pay them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    judge found that the appellant was capable of earning income in the amount
    of $72,500 and concluded that amount of amount of income should be imputed
    to him during the period that he was unemployed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion was argued on the basis of affidavit evidence without cross examinations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant deposed that throughout his unemployment he diligently sought employment.  He
    swore that he regularly scoured job application sites on the internet, used
    head hunters, made “cold calls” and applications, responded to help wanted
    ads he saw in newspapers, and spoke to friends, former colleagues, and acquaintances
    about obtaining employment.  He provided a list of some of the jobs for which
    he had applied. He specifically deposed that he applied for jobs for less
    money than he had been earning beforehand, such as jobs as a bookkeeper and
    credit manager.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s affidavit was supported by that of his brother, with whom he
    resided during his unemployment, and by his adult daughter who lent him money.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent declined the appellant’s invitation to question him under oath
    on his financial statement and disclosure and no questioning has occurred. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, in her affidavit, did not contest that the appellant legitimately
    sought employment, but deposed that it was her belief that even if he was
    unable to obtain employment, he had an obligation to open his own practice
    or start his own business to earn income as he has a child support obligation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view the motion judge erred.  Whether the appellant was intentionally
    under-employed or unemployed was the central issue of the motion and the
    judge had no basis for rejecting the appellant’s uncontradicted affidavit
    evidence that he diligently sought employment without a trial or cross-examination.
    See <i>Ierullo v Ierullo</i> [2006] O.J. No. 3912 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Morever, the judge was mistaken in stating the evidence was that the
    appellant had restricted his job search to controller and financial director-type
    positions.  As noted, the appellant did depose he applied for lower level
    jobs.  It is true, as the judge noted, that when some money came into the
    appellant’s hands from non-employment sources he used it to pay down debts
    rather than to make child support payments. &nbsp;This, however, is not sufficient
    to support the conclusion he was intentionally unemployed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    we have concerns about the evidentiary base for quantifying the appellant’s
    imputed income in the amount of $72,500.  The appellant relied, in part,
    on a Professional Compensation Survey of the Chartered Accountants of Ontario
    in 2005 filed by the respondent and on information she obtained from a Government
    of Canada Human Resources website indicating the average earnings of Canadian
    controllers in 2000.  Both of these reports generally apply to persons with
    credentials that the appellant lacks.  There was no evidence before the court
    regarding the amount of money he could earn as a bookkeeper or credit manager
    or running his own business.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    we allow the appeal and remit the matter for a rehearing.  The costs of the
    motion below are reserved to the judge on the rehearing.  The appellant’s
    costs of the appeal are fixed in the amount of $2500.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST to be set off against any child support arrears that are outstanding.<span style='font-family:Calibri'>&nbsp;</span></p>
