    Ontario, the DIDFA ensures that a consumer is offered the lowest priced drug
    by stipulating generic brands that are “interchangeable” in terms of safety
    and effectiveness to the brand name drug that may have been prescribed.  Under
    the DIDFA, a pharmacist is required to dispense the lowest priced interchangeable
    brand of a prescribed drug unless the doctor specifies “no substitution” or
    the patient requests a higher price brand.  The provincial Minister of Health
    publishes a schedule for designated interchangeable drug products known as
    the Comparative Drug Index (“CDI”). </p>

    a separate provincial regime, certain eligible individuals are provided with
    prescription drugs at no cost.  This regime is governed by the <i>Ontario
    Drug Benefit Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O-10 (“ODBA”).  The ODBA defines categories
    of persons who are entitled to receive their prescription drugs free of charge
    and regulates the system by which pharmacists dispensing drugs to such persons
    are reimbursed by the government. The Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary (the
    “Formulary”) lists the drugs available to eligible persons free of charge
    under the ODBA.</p>

    the Formulary/CDI.  While both lists are published together, a drug may be
    listed on the CDI as an interchangeable drug but may not be listed in the
    Formulary as available free of charge to eligible persons under the ODBA.  In
    this case, Apo-Flavoxate was designated as an interchangeable drug product
    under the DIDFA and was also listed as a benefit under the ODBA until its

    parties largely agree on how the overall legislative scheme works in practical
    terms.  The Minister recommends to the LGIC that drugs be listed or de-listed
    from the Formulary/CDI.  The Minister is advised by the Drug Quality and
    Therapeutics Committee (“Committee”), which is an expert committee made up
    of practicing physicians and pharmacists.  One of the functions of the Committee
    is to review the drugs listed on the Formulary/CDI to ensure their safety,
    efficacy and cost-effectiveness.  Unlike the process that leads to the granting
    of a NOC under the federal legislation, the Committee reviews drugs on an
    on-going basis.</p>

    Review Procedures Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c J-1]. The same may be said about
    the power of the LGIC to pass regulations giving effect to the delisting

    while the two schemes are linked, they serve different goals: “<i>DIDFA</i> focuses
    on interchangeability while the <i>ODBA</i> is geared towards a government
    reimbursement scheme related to provincial expenditures on prescription drugs.”  They
    concluded that the decision to remove Apo-Flavoxate’s interchangeability
    designation under that DIDFA was patently unreasonable because it was not “rationally
    connected” with the decision to remove it as an eligible benefit under the
    ODBA. </p>

    upon being informed that the Minister intended to recommend to the LGIC that

    had repeatedly requested that the Minister not recommend that Apo-Flavoxate
    be de-listed as an inter-changeable product under the DIDFA.  They also requested
    that if the Minister did so recommend, that Apotex be advised.  Apotex was
    not advised and was not given an opportunity to make representations as to
    the removal of Apo-Flavoxate from the CDI.</p>

    contrast, Apotex seeks to characterize the decision to remove the interchangeabiltiy
    designation as a Ministerial decision.  At the operational level, says Apotex,
    it is the Minister who deals with and makes decisions with respect to the
    listing and de-listing of drug products.  Without the Minister’s involvement
    and decision-making, there can be no recommendation to the LGIC, no approval
    by Cabinet and no regulation issued under the DIDFA.  In this case, it was
    the Minister, acting on the Committee’s recommendation, who made the decision
    to de-list Apo-Flavoxate as a drug benefit under the ODBA and the Minister
    who placed that decision before the LGIC for implementation.  The appellants’ invocation
    of the LGIC’s regulation making power, says Apotex, is an effort “to hide
    the de-listing of Apo-Flavoxate from judicial scrutiny under the cloak of
    a Cabinet decision ‘made by the LGIC in the public interest’”.  </p>

    identified the Minister as the substantive decision-maker, Apotex articulates
    its argument as an attack on the decision of the Minister.  Apotex submits
    that “[t]he Ontario Minister must act fairly, and not arbitrarily, when exercising
    its authority”.  It submits that
    “[a] decision to de-list Apo-Flavoxate’s designation as an interchangeable
    product under DIDFA must be exercised in a manner consistent with the rules
    of natural justice.  The circumstances that surround the Ontario Minister’s
    decision to remove the interchangeability status of Apo-Flavoxate constitute
    a denial of natural justice.”  </p>

    further submits that the appellants have failed to challenge the majority’s
    finding that “the Minister’s decision” to remove Apo-Flavoxate as an interchangeable
    product under DIDFA was unfair and breached the rules of natural justice
    because Apotex was never granted an opportunity to make submissions that
    Apo-Flavoxate should maintain its interchangeability status under DIDFA.</p>

    agree with the appellants that s. 14(1.1) is a complete answer to Apotex’s
    application for judicial review.  In my view, there are fundamental flaws
    in Apotex’s position. </p>
  <h2>(a)       No Ministerial Decision or Recommendation to De-List under the
    DIDFA</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    Apotex has tried to characterize the de-listing of Apo-Flavoxate as a Ministerial
    decision, the de-listing of Apo-Flavoxate under the DIDFA was made by a regulation
    enacted by the LGIC pursuant to s. 14(1.1) of the Act. Putting aside that
    the DIDFA does not grant the Minister a power to list or de-list drug products
    as interchangeable, in this case there is no Ministerial decision, or even
    recommendation, that Apotex can seek to attack.  </p>

    if one assumes that the Minister made a “decision”
    to accept the Committee’s recommendation and that the Minister placed before
    Cabinet a recommendation that the LGIC pass a regulation to give effect to
    the Committee’s recommendation, that does not advance Apotex’s argument.  As
    pointed out by Apotex, the Committee recommended that Apo-Flaxovate be removed
    from the drug benefits provided by the ODBA; it did not recommend that Apo-Flavoxate
    be de-listed as an interchangeable drug under the DIDFA.  Apotex therefore
    cannot point to anything that could be characterized as a “decision”
    or “recommendation” by the Minster to de-list Apo-Flavoxate under the DIDFA.
    Rather, as noted by Apotex, the Committee gave no consideration to the DIDFA. </p>

    statutory basis for Regulation 59/04 is s. 14(1.1) of the DIDFA.  The power
    that s. 14 (1.1) grants to the LGIC to remove interchangeability designations
    under the DIDFA is extremely broad.  It empowers the LGIC to de-list a product
    even if it continues to meet the conditions prescribed for interchangeability
    where the LGIC considers it advisable in the public interest to do so.  At
    the time the regulation was made, the DIDFA did not impose any procedural
    pre-conditions to the exercise of the LGIC’s jurisdiction under s. 14(1.1). </p>

    do not accept Apotex’s argument that the fact that Apo-Flavoxate may still
    be sold pursuant to its federal NOC is in some way determinative of a consideration
    of the exercise of the LGIC’s provincial competence.  Any resort by the LGIC
    to s. 14(1.1) to remove the interchangeability of a drug that holds a federal
    NOC may be said to increase the cost to the consumer.  Here as noted above,
    the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals is reviewed under the provincial
    legislation on an on-going basis.  There is evidence on the record that flavoxate
    products are not effective and are considerably more expensive than oxybutynin,
    another drug used in the treatment of urinary incontinence.  Given the great
    deference accorded legislative action, the delisting of Apo-flavoxate from
    the DIDFA cannot be said to be outside the statutory purpose of ensuring
    the public has access to the lowest cost effective drugs. </p>
