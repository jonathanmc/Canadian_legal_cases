    had been assaulted by Mr. Schmidt. The appellant and Mr. Schmidt were visiting
    Jay McColman when the assault occurred. Mr. Schmidt then drove the appellant
    and Jay McColman to Scott McColman’s residence. The police found two rifles

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Possession of

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal arises as a result of language used in the following paragraphs near
    the beginning of the reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            The
    Crown proved that the rifles in question were stolen on May 10, 2004 from
    Walter Lanzinger. When the guns were seized by the police on May 27 and May
    28, 2004, the stocks and barrels had been shortened. I take judicial notice
    that the guns, when they came into possession of the police, were less than
    660 millimetres in length.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Given
    the short time period between the date of the offence and the date when these
    items were stolen and Mr. Choquette was found to be in possession of these
    items, the doctrine of recent possession of stolen property results in his
    being <i>deemed</i> to have knowledge that they were stolen. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel fairly conceded in argument that if by the word “deemed”, the trial
    judge meant that the doctrine is automatic, then that is an error requiring
    a new trial on those charges. However, if he meant that he had concluded
    that he would draw that inference based on the evidence, then there was no
    error. In order to assist in understanding the finding of the trial judge
    on this point, this court asked counsel if the submissions had been recorded
    and could be ordered. Those submissions were subsequently provided to this
    court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Crown counsel made no mention or reference to the doctrine of recent
    possession to prove knowledge that the rifles were stolen. He focussed his
    submissions on the issue of whether the Crown had proved possession by the
    appellant in some constructive or joint form. The issue of the doctrine of
    recent possession was raised by the trial judge with defence counsel during
    his submissions. The trial judge asked defence counsel whether the doctrine
    came into play because the Crown proved the rifles were stolen on May 10
    and they were found on May 27. Noting that the appellant was in possession
    of a stolen item seventeen days after it was stolen, the trial judge specifically
    asked:  “Can I <i>infer</i> from that he knows that it’s stolen?” [Emphasis
    added.].  Defence counsel responded “no”, that there was not a sufficient
    nexus between the dates or between the theft and the appellant because there
    were no fingerprints and no allegation that he was part of the theft. Defence
    counsel wished to focus, as did the Crown, on the issue of whether the Crown
    had proved possession by the appellant. He asked the trial judge whether
    he could address the law on the issue later in his submissions. Unfortunately,
    he never returned to the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    leading authority on the doctrine of recent possession is the Supreme Court
    of Canada decision in <i>Kowlyk v. The Queen</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 61.
    At p. 7, McIntyre J. explained the rule by quoting from a concurring judgment
    of Laskin J. in <i>Regina v. Graham </i>(1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 93  at 108
    (S.C.C.)  as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            The
    use of the term “presumption”, which has been associated with the doctrine,
    is too broad, and the word which properly ought to be substituted is “inference”.
    In brief, where unexplained recent possession and that the goods were stolen
    are established by the Crown in a prosecution for possessing stolen goods,
    it is proper to instruct the jury or, if none, it is proper for the trial
    Judge to proceed on the footing that an inference of guilty knowledge, upon
    which, failing other evidence to the contrary, a conviction can rest, may
    (but, not must) be drawn against the accused.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>McIntyre J.
    went on as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            He
    went on to point out that two questions, that of recency of possession and
    that of the contemporaneity of any explanation, must be disposed of before
    the inference may properly be drawn. He made it clear that no adverse inference
    could be drawn against an accused from the fact of possession alone unless
    it were recent, and that if a pre-trial explanation of such possession were
    given by the accused and if it possessed that degree of contemporaneity making
    evidence of it admissible, no adverse inference could be drawn on the basis
    of the recent possession alone if the explanation were one which could reasonably
    be true. Implicit in Laskin J.’s words that recent possession alone will
    not justify an inference of guilt, where a contemporaneous explanation has
    been offered, is the proposition that in the absence of such explanation
    recent possession alone is quite sufficient to raise a factual inference
    of theft.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McIntyre
    J. concluded at pp. 12-13 that: “In all recent possession cases the inference
    of guilt is permissive, not mandatory, and when an explanation is offered
    which might reasonably be true, even though the trier of fact is not satisfied
    of its truth, the doctrine will not apply.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly
    in this case, as no explanation was offered, once the trial judge was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed the rifles, he was
    entitled to draw the inference that the appellant knew they were stolen,
    if he was satisfied that the theft was sufficiently proximate in time to
    the possession and if there was nothing else in the evidence that would cause
    him not to draw the inference. However, the inference is not mandatory and
    therefore an accused is never deemed to have knowledge based on the doctrine.
    It merely articulates a permissible inference that can be drawn based on
    circumstantial evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge used the term “deemed”, in his
    discussion of the issue with defence counsel, he used the correct word when
    he asked whether he could “infer” knowledge based on the theft seventeen
    days before the rifles were found in the possession of the appellant. Certainly
    it would have been better had the trial judge referred to case law and specifically
    stated why he concluded that seventeen days was sufficiently proximate in
    time for the application of the doctrine. However, a review of the record
    makes it clear that the issue of knowledge that the rifles were stolen was
    not the focus of the trial or of the submissions of either counsel, neither
    of whom provided any case law on the doctrine of recent possession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All

    to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa prior to his arrest in
    <st1:City

    <st1:place

    Ottawa. I am satisfied, based on my review of the submissions, and in particular
    the trial judge’s use of the term
    “infer”, as well as of the reasons for judgment, that the trial judge knew
    that the doctrine of recent possession was not mandatory. When the trial
    judge said the appellant was deemed to have knowledge that the rifles were
    stolen, that was his way of stating that he was drawing the inference of
    knowledge if possession were proved. I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    delivery of the reasons for judgment, the appellant, through his counsel,
    asked that he be sentenced that same day. He had been in custody for fifteen
    months on these charges as well as other charges in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa arising out of events that had occurred there that were referred to
    in the course of the trial. The trial judge acquiesced with that request,
    noting that he was doing so with no information about the appellant other
    than his criminal record and date of birth and with no case law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts relating to the appellant were that he and Mr. Schmidt drove together
    in an SUV that had stolen licence plates to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    North Bay. They called two brothers Mr. Schmidt had previously known, went
    to the home of one, a man in a wheelchair, and took him to the home of the
    other. The appellant and Mr. Schmidt were going back and forth to the vehicle,
    apparently taking drugs. Eventually, Mr. Schmidt became violent and assaulted
    the man in the wheelchair. The brother then turned on the television and
    saw news items suggesting that the appellant and Mr. Schmidt were wanted
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa and called the police. In the meantime, the appellant was tired and
    went to the vehicle where he lay down in the back under a comforter. When
    the police arrived, they pulled him out of the vehicle and found a rifle
    loaded with one round, cocked and ready to fire, pointing out from the vehicle
    and positioned beside where the appellant had been lying down. The next day
    they searched the vehicle and found the other rifle in a gym bag. It was
    accepted that Mr. Schmidt was the person in control of the vehicle and of
    the weapons, but the trial judge found that the appellant was also in possession
    of them. The appellant was acquitted of possession of the stolen licence
    plate with knowledge, but was convicted of two counts of possession of stolen
    prohibited weapons, one count of careless storage, one count of possession
    of weapons while prohibited and one count of possession of weapons without
    a licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown asked for a sentence of two years in addition to pre-trial custody
    of fifteen months credited as thirty months, on the basis of imposing a sentence
    of parity with Mr. Schmidt. He submitted that the aggravating and mitigating
    circumstances in each case cancelled each other out. Defence counsel asked
    for time served. The appellant was thirty-three years old at the time of
    the verdict and sentencing. He has a lengthy criminal record dating back
    to 1991 including offences of theft, fraud, trafficking, assault, possession
    of explosives, driving offences, assault, obstruct police and fail to comply.
    His longest sentence appears to have been six months in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted several comparisons between Mr. Schmidt and the appellant.
    He noted that Mr. Schmidt pled guilty and was sentenced based on a joint
    submission. Although Mr. Schmidt was in possession of the same guns, the
    trial judge had concluded that the appellant had loaded and cocked the rifle
    beside him when he went out to the vehicle to lie down, and considered that
    a very aggravating factor. On the other hand, Mr. Schmidt was convicted of
    a serious attack on a disabled victim, for which the appellant was not responsible.
    On the basis of this comparison, the trial judge agreed with Crown counsel
    that the aggravating and mitigating factors were in balance. The trial judge
    noted that without evidence of the personal background of the appellant,
    he had no other mitigating factors to apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that the possession of the prohibited weapons, one of
    which was loaded and ready to fire, could attract a sentence of five years
    and that he would have been prepared to impose a sentence of five years less
    credit for pre-trial custody, leaving two and a half years to serve. However,
    because he was not prepared to jump the Crown’s submission, he imposed two
    years in addition to pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal, duty counsel submitted that the sentence was excessive and manifestly
    unfit. The appellant had never served time in the penitentiary before, and
    was essentially sentenced to four and a half years in prison for possession
    of two stolen sawed-off shotguns, while Mr. Schmidt got four years for the
    same offences plus a serious assault on a disabled victim. He submitted that
    it was accepted that the appellant was not the leader in the venture and
    that drugs were clearly involved in his behaviour. He relied on <i>R. v.
    Ferguson</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 256 (O.C.A.) where, in somewhat similar
    circumstances, a sentence of two years was upheld. I note, however, that
    in that case, no gun was loaded and no ammunition was found. Finally, counsel
    submitted that the normal deference is not owed on this sentencing because
    the trial judge suggested a sentence of five years without reference to any
    case law.</p>

    agree with duty counsel that it certainly would have been preferable for
    the trial judge to have had a pre-sentence report and more fulsome submissions
    regarding sentence. However, it appears that the sentencing proceeded as
    it did based on the appellant’s wishes. The trial judge purported to apply
    the parity principle to the sentences of the two men, even though Mr. Schmidt
    committed an assault with a knife on a man in a wheelchair as well as possessing
    the stolen guns. He based his comparison of the culpability of the two men
    on the fact that the appellant had a loaded and cocked rifle pointed and
    ready to shoot. My concern is that it appears that the appellant’s sentence
    was longer than Mr. Schmidt’s, and not in parity with it. Defence counsel
    suggested in submissions that Mr. Schmidt’s total sentence was four years
    while the appellant’s was four and a half years. The only evidence on the
    record of Mr. Schmidt’s sentence is the trial judge’s statement that Mr.
    Schmidt was sentenced to two years and ten months.</p>

    my view, in this case where the only basis for the length of sentence was
    the parity principle, it was an error for the trial judge to impose a longer
    sentence on the appellant than on Mr. Schmidt while purporting to impose
    a sentence in parity with his. Based on duty counsel’s position that Mr.
    Schmidt received an effective sentence of four years, I would reduce the
    appellant’s sentence to four years, giving credit for thirty months of pre-trial
    custody. Therefore on each of counts 1 and 2, I would reduce the sentence
    imposed by the trial judge from two years to eighteen months. The sentences
    on the other counts remain the same.</p>

    the result, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction, grant leave to
    appeal sentence and reduce the sentence imposed to eighteen months from two
    years.</p>
