    this appeal, the appellant seeks to withdraw his guilty plea to a charge
    of criminal harassment on the basis that he felt pressured by his counsel
    to plead guilty when he did not believe he was guilty. For the reasons that
    follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>

    May 1, 2005, the appellant was charged with criminal harassment of a woman
    he had been seeing, Ms. K., as well as breach of a probation order. The appellant
    was denied bail and a bail review hearing was set for July 29, 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had prior convictions for uttering threats and for criminal harassment,
    both of which occurred in domestic situations. He had pled guilty on both
    occasions and Mr. Gee had been his lawyer on the latter charge. Following
    his arrest, the appellant contacted Mr. Gee once again to retain his services.
    He called Mr. Gee at least daily and sent him voluminous material regarding
    the merits of the case. Although he claimed he was innocent, he also asked
    his lawyer on a number of occasions what the Crown’s position would be on
    a guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 29, Crown counsel approached Mr. Gee with a resolution proposal of time
    served plus probation as a joint submission. Mr. Gee discussed the proposal
    with the appellant and gave him the option to accept or to proceed with the
    bail review. He told the appellant that the Crown had agreed with his request
    to limit the time frame of the offence to the latter half of April, 2005
    (as opposed to December 2004 to May 1, 2005). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the Crown synopsis and the facts read out at the guilty plea proceedings,
    until April 2005, the appellant and the victim had a dating relationship
    which the victim had tried to end. On April 23, the appellant attended the
    victim’s work and met her in the parking lot where he pumped up the tires
    on her car. She told him not to come to her work and that she did not want
    to see him anymore. On April 28, the appellant attended the victim’s store
    and was asked to leave by her and by her associate. He refused until she
    threatened to call security. On the evening of April 29, the victim lost
    her purse at a bistro. The appellant found the purse and was waiting at her
    home with it when she returned from the bistro. She was with a friend at
    the time who asked the appellant to leave. The victim found a note in her
    purse written by the appellant about her. On April&nbsp;30, both the victim
    and the appellant were at the same bistro. When the victim danced with another
    man and told the appellant to leave her alone, the appellant broke glass
    and turned over chairs. The police were called and ultimately arrested the
    appellant on the harassment charge. At that time, the appellant was bound
    by a probation order made on December 20, 2004 in respect of another charge
    of criminal harassment, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour until
    December 19, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the appellant initially made a claim of ineffective assistance
    of counsel in respect of the guilty plea and sought to file fresh evidence.
    The appeal was adjourned to allow the parties to follow the procedure for
    making the ineffective assistance claim, including notice to the lawyer.
    As a result, each party filed an affidavit and cross-examinations were held.
    A section 684 order was made, appointing duty counsel to assist with the
    procedure and with the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument however, duty counsel abandoned the ineffective assistance
    of counsel claim, and sought to set aside the guilty plea on the basis that
    it was not voluntary and that trial counsel inadvertently pressured the appellant
    into pleading guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his affidavit, filed as fresh evidence on the appeal, the appellant both
    stated that Mr.&nbsp;Gee pressured him into pleading guilty and insisted
    that he was innocent. He stated that he felt pressured because Mr. Gee told
    him that with the offer proposed by the Crown he would be out of jail that
    day, whereas the bail review would be an “uphill battle” because of his previous
    breach of recognizance after another criminal harassment charge. He also
    stated that Mr. Gee had said he could be in custody for several months until
    his trial date and pressured him into making a decision right away.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Gee denies that he pressured the appellant. He advised him that (1) the Crown
    had agreed to limit the time period of the offence to the events in the latter
    part of April where he was most at risk of conviction; (2) success on the
    bail review could not be guaranteed, especially because he had previously
    breached an earlier bail by contacting the victim of the previous harassment;
    (3) the outcome of the trial would depend on credibility findings; (4) although
    the court was not bound by a joint submission, he felt it was reasonable
    and should be accepted by the court; and (5) the proposed probation was favourable
    and would run concurrently with his previous bail order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Mr.&nbsp;Gee did not obtain written instructions, the appellant gave him
    oral instructions that he wished to plead guilty. The appellant was brought
    into court where he advised the presiding Superior Court judge that he intended
    to plead guilty that day. As there was paper work to do in terms of obtaining
    the information and preparing a new indictment, four hours passed before
    the appellant actually pled guilty. During that time he gave no indication
    that he was having second thoughts. When the case was called as the last
    matter on the list, the trial judge conducted a section 606 plea inquiry
    to ensure that the appellant understood that the effect of a plea was an
    admission of guilt and that his plea was voluntary. The appellant answered “yes”
    to both. He also made several statements to the judge before sentence was
    pronounced indicating that he knew the importance of a court order, that
    he had no intention of seeing or calling the victim again, and, in that context,
    acknowledged to the judge that they had been dating, but up until “the weekend
    when this happened.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 4, a few days after the plea, the appellant called Mr. Gee to say
    that he wished to appeal his guilty plea and complained about the account.
    Mr. Gee told him he could not represent him on such an appeal as the only
    basis for it would be that the appellant did not understand what he was doing
    or that Mr. Gee had forced him to do it. Mr. Gee’s evidence on this motion
    was that the appellant said he had understood but was prepared to say anything
    to get out of jail and that he “would think of something to say” to explain
    why he pled guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested a few days later and charged with uttering a death
    threat against Ms. K. and breach of probation. He called Mr. Gee to ask him
    to represent him but Mr. Gee declined in light of the appellant’s wish to
    appeal his guilty plea conviction. The appellant was eventually acquitted
    of the new offences. The trial judge in that case, Cooper J.,  expressed
    a negative impression of the credibility of both the complainant and of the
    appellant.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for determining whether a guilty plea is valid was stated by Doherty
    J.A. in <i>R. v. T.(R.)</i> (1992), 17 C.R. 247 at 252 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            To
    constitute a valid guilty plea, the plea must be voluntary and unequivocal.
    The plea must also be informed, that is the accused must be aware of the
    nature of the allegations made against him, the effect of his plea, and the
    consequences of his plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. King</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 717, this court applied that test on facts
      somewhat similar to this appeal. At trial, King had pled guilty to touching
      a young girl for a sexual purpose based on a plea agreement reached with
      the Crown, which included the withdrawal of a second charge of sexual assault
      of the same child. He sought to withdraw his plea before sentencing, alleging
      that the plea negotiations had been initiated without his instructions,
      the plea bargain was sprung on him on the day of trial, the plea was put
      to him as his best or only chance of avoiding jail and that he had been
      told by a friend that he would be assaulted in jail. The trial judge referred
      to the test in <i>T.(R.)</i> and to the fact that there was authority that
      inducements inherent in a plea negotiation do not in and of themselves
      render a plea involuntary. See for example, <i>R. v. Tryon</i>, [1994]
      O.J. No.&nbsp;332 (C.A.). This court dismissed the appeal from the trial
      judge’s conclusion that the plea was voluntary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is clear from the record in this case that the appellant’s pleas
    were voluntary. He had pled guilty twice before to other offences and was
    familiar with the procedure. He was fully informed of the charges and the
    evidence against him and understood the charges and the effect of his pleas.
    His pleas were unequivocal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the pleas were vitiated because trial counsel
    failed to confirm that the appellant agreed that he was in fact guilty. In <i>R.
    v. Hector</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 81 at paras. 7-8, this court stated
    that that submission did not address any of the issues the court is concerned
    with from <i>T.(R.)</i>. Having said that, counsel should be concerned if
    his or her client does not expressly admit guilt. However, in that case,
    as in this one, counsel was very experienced in criminal law, the accused
    was also familiar with the process, and the lawyer had acted for the accused
    previously. Both understood that a guilty plea meant that the accused was
    acknowledging guilt in relation to the charges. In this case, Mr. Gee ensured
    that the charge was limited in time and did not include the time when the
    appellant and the victim were dating. I note on this issue that the appellant
    did not include in the fresh evidence any suggestion of what his defence
    would have been had he proceeded to trial. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on his subsequent acquittal on the death threat charge and
    the adverse findings of credibility made about the victim by Cooper J. to
    suggest that the guilty pleas resulted in a miscarriage of justice in this
    case. I do not agree. Cooper J. in that case also disparaged the appellant’s
    credibility. Nor did he make any finding regarding the events charged in
    April, 2005.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says he felt pressured and rushed into a decision. However, as
    several hours passed between the decision and the pleas in court, this submission
    has little credence. I accept that the appellant may well have been induced
    by the prospect of release from prison that day rather than possibly waiting
    in jail for a trial date. However, as this court said in <i>King</i>, that
    type of inducement alone does not vitiate a plea. In this case, I see nothing
    else.</p>

    fresh evidence in this appeal is the appellant’s affidavit, which attests

    Both the circumstances on the record of the guilty plea as well as the responding
    evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Gee show that the appellant’s plea was fully informed
    and voluntary and  that he changed his mind about the plea after he was released
    from jail. I do not find the fresh evidence of the appellant credible and  I
    would not admit it on the appeal.</p>
