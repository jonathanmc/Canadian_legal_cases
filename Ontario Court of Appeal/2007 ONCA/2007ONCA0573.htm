style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Douglas Titus, was employed as in&#8209;house corporate counsel
    by the appellant William Cooke and his group of companies (collectively,
    the “appellants”).  The respondent worked for the appellants for eighteen
    months, from March 28, 2000 to September 28, 2001.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 28, 2001, the appellants fired the respondent.  They offered the
    respondent a settlement package, provided he signed a release.  The respondent
    accepted the offer and signed the release on the spot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent sought and obtained new, albeit less remunerative, employment
    within two weeks.  He received the settlement funds within a month.  Shortly
    thereafter, he sued the appellants, claiming that the settlement and release
    were unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    a short trial, the trial judge, Paisley J., found in favour of the respondent.  The
    appellants appeal, but on only one issue <span style='font-family:

'>-</span> did the trial judge err by setting aside the release that the respondent
    had signed?</p>

    respondent graduated from Queen’s

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    1978 to 1987, the respondent served as an in&#8209;house counsel for Proctor &amp; Gamble.  His
    employment was terminated in 1987 and he accepted a severance package from
    the company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    May 1988, the respondent went to work for the appellants, a group of Ontario
    companies controlled by William Cooke that carry on the business of distributing
    American television programs to television networks and independent television
    stations in Canada.  The respondent was employed by the appellants to replace
    their in&#8209;house corporate counsel who was on leave.  When this counsel
    returned, the respondent’s employment was terminated.  He received a severance
    package, which he accepted, in March 1989.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    May 1989 to April 1991, the respondent was employed as an in&#8209;house
    counsel at Boeing de Havilland.  His employment with that company was terminated
    in 1991 and he accepted a severance package.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    1991 to 1994, the respondent served a second stint as in&#8209;house counsel
    with the appellants.  When his employment was terminated in 1994, he accepted
    a severance package that included permission to use an office in the appellants’ premises
    while he searched for new employment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    1994 to 1997, the respondent was largely unemployed except for a six&#8209;month
    period when he worked for the Practice Advisory Service of the Law Society
    of Upper Canada.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    1997 to 1998, the respondent was employed as an in&#8209;house counsel for
    Fantasia, an adult entertainment company, at a salary of $65,000 per year.  He
    resigned his position because of concerns about his employer’s business activities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1999, the respondent made a major career change.  He abandoned his search
    for a corporate counsel position and became a full&#8209;time duty counsel
    with Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  His salary was $45,000 per year.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early 2000, the appellants approached the respondent again regarding the
    possibility of employment as in&#8209;house counsel.  The parties engaged
    in sporadic negotiations for three months and ultimately reached an agreement.  The
    respondent would work as in&#8209;house counsel at a salary of $115,000 per
    year.  He would also receive a car allowance of $450 per month, payment of
    his law society fees and practice insurance, and parking and medical benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent commenced employment on March 28, 2000.  He performed effectively.  However,
    eighteen months later, on Friday, September 28, 2001, William Cooke called
    the respondent into his office and told him that he was being terminated
    due to business downsizing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>David
    Fraser, the appellants’ chief financial officer, joined the meeting and presented
    the respondent with a written termination letter and severance offer, signed
    by Mr.&nbsp;Cooke, the crucial terms of which were:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We write to inform you that as a result of a change
    in our business requirements and our long&#8209;term personnel plans, it
    is necessary to make certain personnel decisions.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Your employment with the Company will be terminated
    effective today.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In an effort to assist you herein, the Company is
    prepared to provide you with the following separation package:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         The Company will forthwith pay you 2
    weeks of base&nbsp;salary (less applicable deductions) as termination pay&nbsp;in&nbsp;accordance
    with Section 57(1)(a) of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, S.O. 1990,
    as amended (the “Act”);</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         The Company is prepared to pay you a
    gratuitous additional lump sum payment equal to 2 ½ months of your annual
    salary (less applicable deductions).  These payments exceed your statutory
    entitlement pursuant to the Act.  You are no longer required to report to
    work.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         Your benefits, will be maintained until
    the earlier of the 31<sup>st</sup> day of October, 2001 or the date on which
    you obtain alternate employment.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>8.         The
    Company is prepared to provide you with a letter of reference.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>9.         In exchange for all of the above, we
    require you to execute the attached Release, confirming your acceptance of
    this arrangement on or before Friday October 5, 2001.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>10.       If you choose not to accept this separation
    package and sign the attached Release, the Company will pay you your 2 weeks
    of termination pay under the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    release referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 provided that the respondent released
    and forever discharged the appellants from all actions, causes of action,
    suits and complaints arising from his
    “hiring by, employment with and cessation of employment with the Employer.”  The
    release concluded with these words, in highlighted capital letters directly
    above the space for the respondent’s signature:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I HAVE READ THIS DOCUMENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
    IT CONTAINS A FULL AND FINAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS THAT I HAVE OR MAY HAVE
    AGAINST THE RELEASEES.  I AM SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT VOLUNTARILY.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent read the documents at the meeting.  Mr. Cooke and Mr. Fraser suggested
    that he take them home and consider them over the weekend.  The respondent
    declined.  He signed the release and requested immediate payment of the settlement
    funds.  The appellants prepared a cheque for $16,087.65, being the amount
    of the severance funds ($28,750), less statutory deductions for withholding
    taxes.  The respondent left the premises with the cheque.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Due
    to a drafting error, the cheque could not be cashed.  The respondent contacted
    Mr.&nbsp;Fraser the following week to advise of the problem with the cheque
    and requested that the appellants pay him the two weeks statutory severance
    and pay the balance of the settlement funds into his Registered Retirement
    Savings Plan (“RRSP”) without deduction for withholding taxes.  The appellants
    agreed to do this.  On October 31, 2001, the respondent delivered to the
    appellants the documents they required to directly deposit the funds to his
    RRSP and, on November 1, 2001, the appellants issued a cheque to the respondent
    for $4,423.08 (for the statutory two&#8209;week notice period) and deposited
    $24,326.92 (the balance of the remaining two and one&#8209;half months agreed
    notice period) directly into the respondent’s RRSP account.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 12, 2001, two weeks after his termination, the respondent obtained

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 9, 2002, the respondent commenced an action against the appellants
    seeking damages for wrongful dismissal.  Central to the success of the action
    was the respondent’s request that the release he had signed be set aside
    as unconscionable, or as having been procured by undue influence or duress.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons unknown, the trial did not take place for almost four years.  The
    trial commenced on February 20, 2006.  The trial judge heard testimony from
    Mr. Titus, Mr.&nbsp;Cooke and Mr. Fraser on February 20 and 21.  Counsel
    made their closing submissions on February 22 and the trial judge rendered
    an oral judgment the same day.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    the base salary was subject to a $5,000 increase after one year of service&nbsp;<span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>-</span>&nbsp;the trial judge found in favour of the respondent.  On a third
    disputed issue, the trial judge held that the appropriate period of common
    law notice for the termination of the respondent was ten months.  The appellants
    do not appeal these dispositions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in order to reach the issue of common law damages for wrongful dismissal,
    the trial judge first had to consider whether the release was binding on
    the respondent.  If it was binding, then the respondent could have no cause
    of action against the appellants because the release specifically precluded
    this.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that the release did not bind the respondent.  He concluded: “In
    my view, it would be wrong for me to apply the release as written, to deny
    the employee the compensation that he was entitled to by the Common Law.”  The
    appellants appeal this component of the judgment.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>C.        </span>ISSUE</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only issue on the appeal is whether the trial judge erred in concluding that
    the release signed by the respondent should be set aside.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his Statement of Claim, the respondent pleaded unconscionability, undue influence
    and duress.  In the short trial, the respondent advanced only a claim based
    on unconscionability.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the start of his oral reasons, the trial judge defined the issues in this
    fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The plaintiff, Douglas Titus, is a member of the
    Bar of Ontario and was employed by the defendant when he was terminated without
    cause.  The plaintiff signed a release on termination.  The principal issues
    which I have to decide are: What was the agreement that the plaintiff and
    defendants entered into.  Was it for a limited time period, or was it an
    indefinite contract of employment.  <i>Was the release signed and accepted,
    signed in circumstances that are unconscionable or unfair, so as to render
    the release unenforceable</i>, and, if so, the proper notice or salary in
    lieu of notice in the event that the contract was for an indefinite term.                                                                         (Emphasis
    added.)</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then provided a comprehensive and careful review of the facts.  Next,
    he analyzed the first issue and concluded that the employment contract was
    for an indefinite term.  The appellants do not challenge this conclusion
    on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    this point in his oral reasons (represented by twenty&#8209;three pages of
    typed transcript), the trial judge turned to the second issue, the release
    issue: <span lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman";'>“</span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>What
    to make of the release.”</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately,
      in his consideration of this issue, the trial judge did not apply the law
      of unconscionability; indeed, he never referred to the concept.  Instead,
      he anchored his analysis of the release issue in the decision of the Supreme
      Court of Canada in <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997]
      3 S.C.R. 701.  Applying <i>Wallace</i> to the circumstances relating to
      the release, the trial judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is a breach of good faith as the law, which
    I have reviewed, would define it.  This was an exercise of power in the circumstances
    where the employer, in a relatively secure position, was aware that the employee
    was in a very insecure position.  And that was unfair and a breach of good
    faith.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants contend that the trial judge’s finding of “breach of good faith” was
    misconceived (because it was unresponsive to the pleaded and argued central
    issue <span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>-</span> unconscionability) and, in any event, was grounded in a misreading
    of <i>Wallace</i>.  I agree with these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Wallace</i>,
    the court held that there is no actionable tort of breach of duty of good
    faith and fair dealing in the employment law context.  However, bad faith
    conduct <i>in the manner of dismissal</i> may be compensated for by an addition
    to the applicable common law notice period awarded to the employee.  As explained
    by Iacobucci&nbsp;J. at para.&nbsp;88:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The appellant urged this Court to recognize the
    ability of a dismissed employee to sue in contract or alternatively in tort
    for
    “bad faith discharge”.  Although I have rejected both as avenues for recovery,
    by no means do I condone the behaviour of employers who subject employees
    to callous and insensitive treatment in their dismissal, showing no regard
    for their welfare.  Rather, I believe that such bad faith conduct in the
    manner of dismissal is another factor that is properly compensated for by
    an addition to the notice period.</p>

    observe that the respondent did not attempt, either in his factum or in oral
    argument, to uphold the release component of the trial judgment on the basis
    of the trial judge’s ‘good faith’
    analysis.  Rather, the respondent’s position is that on the basis of the
    record before the trial judge (now before this court) the release should
    have been set aside as unconscionable.  In oral argument before this court,
    this is where the argument was joined.  I turn, therefore, to this issue.</p>

    party relying on the doctrine of unconscionability to set aside a transaction

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In order to set aside the transaction between the

    J.A. reviewed the leading cases and academic commentary and concluded, at

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Those authorities discuss four elements which appear
    to be necessary for unconscionability…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         a grossly unfair and improvident transaction;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         victim’s lack of independent legal advice
    or other suitable advice; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         overwhelming imbalance in bargaining
    power caused by victim’s ignorance of business, illiteracy, ignorance of
    the language of the bargain, blindness, deafness, illness, senility, or similar
    disability; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.         other party’s knowingly taking advantage
    of this vulnerability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the respondent could not bring himself within any of these four
    elements.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(1)       </span>Grossly
    unfair transaction</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ offer of three month’s salary in lieu of notice was not grossly
    unfair.  The appellants sought legal advice about the contents of their settlement
    offer.  The respondent had worked for the appellants for only eighteen months.  It
    should be noted that he had worked for the appellants on two previous occasions,
    for ten months and three years respectively.  However, when he was terminated
    on these prior occasions the respondent accepted severance packages.
     Accordingly, his previous periods of employment can do no more than provide
    context for fixing an appropriate notice period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is true that the trial judge, after considering the factors in <i>Bardal
    v. Globe and Mail Ltd.</i> (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.J.), determined
    that the appropriate notice period was ten months, and that the appellants
    do not challenge this conclusion.  However, the fact that ten months is a
    reasonable notice period does not mean that the appellants’ offer of three
    months was grossly unfair.  If the respondent accepted the offer, he would
    receive the money immediately, he would have an opportunity to mitigate his
    damages by seeking new employment (in fact, the respondent obtained a new
    position within two weeks of his termination) and, importantly, he would
    avoid the delay, costs and uncertainty of litigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    linking of the letter of reference to acceptance of the settlement offer
    is potentially problematic.  There is no legal obligation on an employer
    to provide a letter of reference.  However, a threat to withhold a letter
    of reference by the employer as part of a negotiation/litigation strategy
    may, in some situations, provide valuable support for an employee’s subsequent
    claim that a release was unconscionable and should not be enforced.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whatever
    may be said about the threat to withhold a letter of reference in some other
    factual context, it played a very small part in the process that produced
    this release.  Moreover, the respondent did not seek to negotiate on this
    issue and it appears that he did not request a reference letter as he sought
    new employment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    linking the settlement offer to the release was not grossly unfair.  The
    respondent, with long experience in both contract and employment law, described
    it in his testimony as “look[ing] like a standard release taken out of the
    text books.”  In short, it was fair for the appellants, in the context of
    a reasonable settlement offer, to propose a release.  It was then up to the
    respondent to accept, reject or negotiate any component of the offer, including
    the release.  The respondent accepted the offer.</p>
  <h4><span

    of legal advice</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Obviously,
    this factor is inapplicable in this case.  The respondent is a senior lawyer
    with extensive experience in contract and employment law.  In his <i>curriculum
    vitae</i>, the respondent described himself as “Senior Counsel for two multinationals:
    Boeing Canada Ltd. And Proctor &amp; Gamble Inc.”  Under the heading <i>Significant
    Activities and Accomplishments</i>, he recorded:
    “Employment Law: Counsel for senior management in all areas of employment
    including Wrongful Dismissals….”  In short, the respondent did not want or
    need legal or other advice.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(3)       </span>Overwhelming
    imbalance in bargaining power</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is an inherent imbalance in bargaining power between an employer and an employee
    when the former terminates the employment of the latter.  The employer’s
    business will continue, the employer will be there, and the employee will
    be gone.  Thus, as Iacobucci&nbsp;J. said in <i>Wallace</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 95: “The point at which the employment relationship ruptures is
    the time when the employee is most vulnerable and hence, most in need of
    protection.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the respondent asserts that the starting point of vulnerability
    at the moment of termination was magnified by two important personal circumstances <span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>-</span> the recent death of his father (three weeks before termination) and
    his desperate financial situation (high debt load).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Acknowledging
    these aspects of general and specific vulnerability, they do not, in my view,
    rise to the level of creating an overwhelming imbalance in bargaining power
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    generalized vulnerability of all terminated employees is diminished in this
    case by the fact that the respondent was a senior, knowledgeable lawyer particularly
    well&#8209;versed in contract and employment law, including the law relating
    to wrongful dismissal.  In short, the respondent knew well his position and
    his options (accept, reject, negotiate).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    death of his father was, of course, a difficult and sad event for the respondent.  However,
    the appellants put no pressure on the respondent and told him to take the
    time he needed to deal with this unfortunate event.  As for the respondent’s
    high debt load, it is not clear from the record how the respondent got in
    this predicament.  After all, for the eighteen months before his termination
    he was receiving a salary of almost $10,000 per month plus generous benefits
    and he was living at his parents’ home.  Additionally, the picture of financial
    desperation is clouded somewhat by the fact that the respondent chose to
    place most of the severance money he accepted and received in his RRSP account
    rather than pay down his debt.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(4)       </span>Employer
    taking advantage of employee’s vulnerability</h4>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants sought legal advice about an appropriate severance package to
    present to the respondent.  The contents of the package were not unreasonable.  The
    termination was announced, and the severance package presented, in private
    in a company office and in a polite, professional manner.  The appellants
    strongly advised the respondent to take time to consider their offer.  When
    the respondent rejected their advice and asked for immediate payment, the
    appellants wrote a cheque the same day.  After the cheque could not be cashed
    due to an inadvertent drafting error and the respondent requested a combination
    of payments directly to himself and into his RRSP account, the appellants
    complied with this request one day after receiving the relevant documents. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    is true that the appellants fired the respondent and that the termination
    was without cause.  However, the law permits this and structures both how
    termination is achieved (manner) and its consequences for the employee (compensation).  In
    this case, the appellants’ conduct was professional and lawful throughout.</p>
