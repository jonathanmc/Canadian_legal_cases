    Harris, the respondent, was a passenger in a motor vehicle stopped by the
    police after the driver failed to signal a left turn.  The officer asked
    all of the occupants, including Harris who was sitting in the front passenger
    seat, to identify themselves.  They did so.  The officer checked the names
    through the Canadian Police Information Centre  (“CPIC”) and discovered that
    Harris was apparently on bail, a term of which required him to abide by a
    curfew.  That curfew had long passed.  The officer returned to the vehicle,
    arrested Harris, handcuffed him, took him back to the police cruiser, and
    searched him.  During that search, the officer discovered  a quantity of
    crack cocaine tucked into the waistband of Harris’s underwear.  He charged
    Harris with possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and advised
    him of his right to counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Harris
    brought a <i>Charter</i> application at the outset of his trial alleging
    several constitutional violations.  The trial judge found that Harris was
    arbitrarily detained and subject to an unconstitutional search when he asked
    him to identify himself while he was detained in the vehicle.  She further
    held that Harris was denied his right to counsel while under arbitrary detention.  The
    trial judge concluded that the cocaine seized from Harris was obtained as
    the result of these constitutional violations and should be excluded under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Without the cocaine, the Crown had no case
    and Harris was acquitted.  </p>

    would allow the appeal.  I would hold that Harris was not arbitrarily detained
    when asked for identification and was not denied the right to counsel.  I
    do agree, however, with the trial judge’s finding that the officer’s request
    that Harris identify himself constituted an unreasonable search and seizure.  I
    would not, however, exclude the cocaine from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  I would order a new trial.</p>

  <h4>THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS AT TRIAL</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has the benefit of the trial judge’s detailed and careful reasons on
    the <i>Charter</i> application.  I take my summary of the relevant events
    from those reasons.  I also accept her findings of fact.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Lipkus and his partner were on patrol in a marked police car at about 1:00
    a.m. in downtown
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  They observed a van turn left without making a signal.  Lipkus
    decided to pull the van over for failure to signal the left turn.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lipkus
    followed the vehicle for a short distance and then directed the driver to
    pull over to the side of the road.  He left his patrol car and approached
    the van.  Lipkus saw three people in the van, the driver, Harris, who was
    sitting in the front passenger seat, and a woman sitting in the back seat.  Lipkus
    also noticed that Harris was not wearing his seatbelt as required by law.  At
    the same time, Lipkus saw Harris lean forward with his left hand down the
    small of his back.  Lipkus became concerned about his safety and ordered
    everyone in the car to keep their hands where he could see them.  They did
    so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Lipkus asked the driver for his licence, ownership and insurance.  The driver
    produced the necessary documentation.  Lipkus asked Harris and the other
    passenger for identification.  Lipkus testified that he was contemplating
    giving Harris a ticket for failing to wear his seatbelt.  He also testified
    that he routinely asked all passengers in vehicles stopped vehicle for <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> purposes to identify themselves.  Lipkus put it this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is just a
    routine – routine investigation – it helps us conduct our investigation thoroughly.  If
    there is anything pertinent or anything important that these three parties
    will have on them or this vehicle that could involve, as I said, anything
    from probations to recognizance, whether the vehicle was stolen or not, to
    numerous types of other information, it allows us to act as police officers
    and enforce the laws.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lipkus
    testified that he used the identification to obtain information through CPIC
    about driver’s licences, criminal records, whether persons were on probation
    or bail, or whether they were under some
    “level of surveillance”.  The trial judge summarized his evidence in these
    terms, at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he primary
    purpose, at least in his mind, for these checks was to obtain as much information
    as possible so that the individual in question can be as thoroughly investigated,
    simply for general purposes, as CPIC will allow.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge specifically rejected the officer’s testimony on cross-examination
    that the request for information related to officer safety concerns.  She
    also concluded that the request for identification was unrelated to Harris’s
    seatbelt violation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is clear from
    P.C. Lipkus’ evidence that his request for Mr. Harris’ identity did not relate
    to driving offences.  <u>He did testify that he was considering charging
    Mr. Harris for a seatbelt violation but it is clear that there was no nexus
    in his mind between this consideration and his request for Mr. Harris’ name.</u>  It
    is clear from the portion of his evidence that I have quoted at paragraph
    18 above that he asked for Mr. Harris’ name simply out of routine and that
    this was the routine that he followed whenever he pulled a vehicle over.  [Emphasis
    added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    driver and both passengers gave Lipkus the information he requested.  Lipkus
    informed Harris that he was not wearing a seatbelt.  He then told the three
    occupants of the vehicle that he was going back to his police vehicle to “do
    a couple of checks” and that he would return momentarily.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lipkus
    went back to his vehicle and ran the names of the two passengers through
    CPIC.  He had already run the licence plate of the vehicle through CPIC and
    identified the owner. It is not entirely clear from his evidence, but it
    would appear that Constable Lipkus checked the information provided by the
    driver with the information provided through CPIC at the same time that he
    ran the names of the passengers through CPIC.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    information provided to Constable Lipkus by CPIC indicated that Harris was
    on bail, one of the terms of which provided for a curfew.  Harris was in
    breach of that term.  Based on the CPIC information, Constable Lipkus decided
    to arrest Harris for breaching his bail.  In fact, the charges giving rise
    to the bail had been withdrawn six days earlier, thereby vacating the bail.  The
    bail information had not, however, been removed from CPIC system.  The trial
    judge concluded, and I agree, that Lipkus acted reasonably in relying on
    the information provided by CPIC in forming reasonable and probable grounds
    to arrest Harris.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Lipkus returned to the van and told Harris to get out of the vehicle.  He
    placed Harris under arrest for breaching his bail, handcuffed him, and took
    him back to the police car.  At the police car, Lipkus conducted a quick
    search of Harris to make sure that he did not have any weapons or devices
    that could be used to escape from custody.  During this search Lipkus noticed
    a significant bulge sticking out of Harris’s lower back.  On further investigation,
    Lipkus discovered a package containing 17 grams of cocaine.  He arrested
    Harris for possession of the cocaine and advised him of his right to counsel.  Harris
    told Lipkus that he understood his right to counsel and named his lawyer.  No
    issue is taken with the search of Harris after his arrest.  </p>

    went back to the van and told the driver and the other passenger that they
    were free to go.  Lipkus decided not to give the driver a ticket for the
    improper left turn.  He also did not turn his mind to whether Harris should
    be given a ticket for the seatbelt violation.  Lipkus explained that once
    the cocaine was discovered, the scope of his investigation changed and he
    focused on the drug offence and not the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c.H.8 matters.</p>

    Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 505 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Mann</i> (2004),

    counsel accepts that the driver was detained from the moment he pulled his
    vehicle over in compliance with the direction of Lipkus.  He argues, however,
    that Harris, as a passenger in the vehicle, was not subject to any police
    demand and was, therefore, not detained, even though his physical movements
    were obviously impeded when the vehicle was pulled over.  </p>

    trial judge, however, did not proceed on the basis that Harris was detained
    from the moment the vehicle was pulled over.  Instead, she focussed on Constable
    Lipkus’s direction as he approached the vehicle to all of the occupants that
    they keep their hands where he could see them.  She characterized this as
    a demand and concluded, at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view, however,
    it would have cast an aura of psychological oppression over the occupants.  It
    appears that the officer gave no explanation for the demand, which would
    add to the oppressive atmosphere.  <u>It was inevitable that Mr. Harris would
    have felt compelled not only to remain at the scene but also to answer any
    questions that followed.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    the determination of whether a person is detained demands a fact-specific
    inquiry, it is appropriate that this court consider the question of detention
    on the same factual basis as did the trial judge.  I, therefore, decline
    to decide whether Harris was detained when the vehicle was stopped.</p>

    agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Harris would reasonably understand
    that he was not free to leave the vehicle after Constable Lipkus ordered
    him to keep his hands in open view.  Harris was under psychological constraint
    at least from the point when Constable Lipkus made that demand.  He remained
    in detention for the rest of his encounter with the officer.  It follows
    that Harris was detained when Constable Lipkus asked him to identify himself.</p>

    trial judge accepted that Constable Lipkus was entitled to pull the vehicle
    over for the apparent violation of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  She specifically
    rejected the defence contention that the traffic violation was a pretext
    for the stop so that Constable Lipkus could gather police intelligence by
    questioning the occupants of the vehicle.  The trial judge also accepted
    that Lipkus acted lawfully when he took control of the movement of the passengers
    in the vehicle as he approached the vehicle.  Consequently, on her analysis,
    which I accept, Harris was lawfully detained at least until Lipkus asked
    him for identification.  </p>

    returned to his vehicle to run Harris’s identification through CPIC, he had
    already finished his investigation of the driver and could not rely on the <i>Highway

    for purposes that had nothing to do with the enforcement of the <i>Highway

    said, at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… I find, however,

    cannot agree that the request of Harris for identification for purposes unrelated
    to the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> altered the constitutionality of his detention.  Harris
    was detained by virtue of the lawful stopping of the vehicle, the ongoing
    investigation of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> violation, and Lipkus’s lawful
    assuming of control over the movements of the passengers in the vehicle.  On
    the trial judge’s factual findings, Lipkus’s request for identification did
    not prolong or alter the nature of Harris’s detention.  He remained in exactly
    the same position he would have been in had Lipkus questioned only the driver.  </p>

    detention, that is the limitation on his personal physical freedom imposed

    without individualized cause.  The detention flowed from the officer’s observations
    of the vehicle, his decision to pursue the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> investigation,
    and the reasonable steps he took to assume control of the occupants of the
    vehicle.  As the trial judge observed, these observations gave Lipkus proper

    agree with Mr. Dawe, counsel for Harris, that the Crown misreads <i>Brown</i>.  <i>Brown</i> does
    not suggest that once the police are engaged in a lawful stop under the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, they may pursue any other legitimate police interests.  <i>Brown</i> holds
    that the existence of additional legitimate police interests cannot render
    unconstitutional police conduct that is justified under the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>.  For example, in <i>Brown</i>, the police were authorized by the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> to obtain identification from the operators of the motorcycles.  They
    used the identification not only for <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> purposes,
    but for more general police intelligence gathering purposes.  At para. 31
    of <i>Brown</i>, I said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… The police
    are entitled on a s. 216(1) stop to require drivers to produce their licences.  That
    requirement is consistent with the highway safety concerns which underlie
    the power granted by the section.  <u>In addition to ensuring that the driver
    is properly licensed, the police may wish to identify the driver for other
    purposes.  It may be, as in this case, that the police are interested in
    knowing the identity of all those who are connected with what they believe
    to be organized criminal activity.  The gathering of police intelligence
    is well within the ongoing police duty to investigate criminal activity.  As
    long as the additional police purpose is not improper and does not entail
    any infringement on the liberty or security of the detained person beyond
    that contemplated by the purpose animating s. 216(1) of the <i>HTA</i>, I
    see no reason for declaring the legitimate police interest beyond highway
    safety concerns</u> should taint the lawfulness of the stop and the detention.  [Emphasis

    no sound reason for invalidating an otherwise proper stop because the police
    used the opportunity afforded by that stop to further other legitimate interest,
    I do see strong policy reasons for invalidating a stop where the police have

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>When I refer
    to improper police purposes I include purposes which are illegal, <u>purposes

    the person asserting a s. 8 right has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The
    thing taken may be tangible or intangible.  Information can be seized.  At
    its most fundamental, s. 8 preserves an individual zone of privacy against

      similar fact situation to this case and offers insight into when police
      questioning will constitute a search or seizure.  In <i>Mellenthin</i>,
      the accused was pulled over by the police at a roadside checkpoint operated
      for the purpose of examining the roadworthiness of vehicles.  The stop
      was arbitrary but constitutional.  The police officer used the opportunity
      afforded by the stop to randomly investigate other potential crimes.  He
      questioned the driver about the contents of a bag that the officer noticed
      in the back of the vehicle.  The driver’s answers to the questions eventually
      led the officer to physically seize the bag.  He discovered narcotics in
      the bag and charged the driver with possession of the narcotics.  </p>

    J. held that the officer had no lawful authority under the guise of a safety
    check to question the driver about the contents of the bag or to physically
    seize the bag from the driver.  Cory J. further concluded that the improper
    questions constituted the beginning of an unreasonable search that culminated
    in the unreasonable seizure of the bag.  He said, at p. 487:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'><u>However,
      the subsequent questions pertaining to the gym bag were improper.  At the
      moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest
      suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession
      of the appellant.</u>  The appellant’s words, actions and manner of driving
      did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment.  Check-stop programs result
      in the arbitrary detention of motorists.  The programs are justified as
      a means aimed at reducing the terrible toll of death and injury so often
      occasioned by impaired drivers or by dangerous vehicles.  The primary aim
      of the program is thus to check for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance
      and the mechanical fitness of cars.  The police use of check stops should
      not be extended beyond these aims.  <u>Random stop programs must not be
      turned into a means of conducting either an unfounded general inquisition
      or an unreasonable search.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>

    reasonably be inferred that he felt compelled to respond to the questions

    Crown next argues that a person has no or, at its highest, a minimal expectation
    of privacy in his or her name.  The Crown submits that merely providing one’s
    name reveals little, if anything, of any personal nature concerning that
    person.  In some contexts, there will be considerable merit to this submission.  However,
    in the present case, Harris was under police detention.  Lipkus was not asking
    Harris to identify himself out of some sense of curiosity or so he could
    greet Harris by name should they meet again.  Lipkus had a very specific
    purpose in mind when he asked for identification.  He intended to use that
    identification to access a wealth of personal information about Harris before
    allowing Harris to proceed on his way.  That information included whether
    Harris had a criminal record, was subject to any outstanding court orders
    and, if so, the terms of those orders.  Although Crown counsel submits that
    the officer’s request for identification was “not directed at obtaining incriminating
    information in relation to unrelated criminal conduct”, I think that was
    precisely one of the reasons Lipkus asked Harris for identification.  Why
    else would Lipkus use the identification to determine whether Harris was
    in breach of any outstanding court orders?  </p>

    difference between Lipkus asking Harris to identify himself and then checking
    that identification through CPIC, and Lipkus asking Harris a series of questions
    about his criminal past, his bail status, and the terms of any bail that
    Harris might be under.  Lipkus’s immediate access to information available
    on CPIC made Lipkus’s request for identification the equivalent of Lipkus
    asking Harris whether he was breaching any court orders at that moment.  </p>

    and provide the requested information to the police:  <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990),
    57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In the circumstances, Harris’s identification

    to suspect Harris of anything when he questioned him and requested his identification.  The
    purpose for the stop and the consequential detention of Harris and the other
    occupants of the vehicle had nothing to do with the request for Harris’s
    identification.  The purpose of the stop did not justify an at large inquiry
    into Harris’s background or his status in the criminal justice system.  That
    was the effect of the request for identification.  Just as in <i>Mellenthin</i>,
    Lipkus expanded a <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> stop into a broader and unrelated
    inquiry.  Harris’s identification of himself provided the entr<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>e

    support of the contention that the request for identification could not constitute
    a search or seizure under s. 8, Crown counsel relies on cases like <i>R.
    v. Grafe</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 267 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Hall</i> (1995),
    22 O.R. (3d) 289 (C.A.).  Those cases accept that the police may in the course
    of their duties properly request identification from individuals in circumstances
    where the police have no reason to suspect that individual of any misconduct.  <i>Grafe</i> and
    the other cases, however, turn largely on the finding that the person who
    was asked for identification was not under police detention or any other
    form of compulsion to answer the request for identification.  If, as in this
    case, a request for identification is made in circumstances of detention
    in which the detained individual reasonably feels compelled to answer the
    request for identification, then the question assumes a coercive quality
    in the nature of a demand, which suggests a state seizure of the response:  see <i>Mellenthin</i>, <i>supra;

    for the purposes of s. 8 and other questioning will not.  Laskin J.A. pointed
    out that the nature of the questions and the context in which those questions
    were asked are important considerations in determining whether the questions
    constituted a search.  On his analysis, it was important to consider whether
    the question was, in the minds of the police, preliminary to a more detailed
    search.  In the present case, when Lipkus asked for identification, he intended
    to use that identification to conduct a CPIC search, one of the purposes
    of which was to determine whether the appellant was under any court orders
    and in breach of any court orders.  I think the officer’s intention to use
    Harris’s identification to make the various inquiries available through CPIC
    is akin to an intention to conduct a further more intrusive search after
    receiving the answer to the request for identification.  <i>Grant</i> offers
    support for my conclusion that the request for identification in the circumstances
    of this case amounted to a search or seizure for the purposes of s. 8. </p>

    and continued to operate when Lipkus checked that identification through

    am satisfied that Harris was lawfully detained as part of a <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i> brief roadside detention.  It flows from counsel’s concession, which
    I accept as well founded, that this detention did not trigger the rights
    set out in s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Lipkus did not offend against
    s. 10(b) when he did not advise Harris of his right to counsel before asking

    to the appellant either that he could refuse to provide identification or
    that he could speak to a lawyer before doing so is further confirmation that
    the officer’s request for identification was in fact in the nature of a demand
    for identification, which constituted a seizure.  </p>

    than an appeal brought by an accused where a judge refuses to exclude evidence
    under s. 24(2).  I disagree.  The ultimate question of admissibility is a
    question of law.  If the trial judge excludes evidence under s. 24(2) and
    that decision is tainted by an error in principle, a misapprehension of material
    evidence, or is arrived at by virtue of an unreasonable assessment of the

    effect of receiving the evidence on the due administration of justice operated
    in favour of excluding the cocaine.  In concluding that the <i>Charter</i> breaches
    were serious, the trial judge referred to the number of the violations.  She
    found three separate <i>Charter</i> violations.  The trial judge also placed
    some significance on what she described as the officer’s “unreasonable ignorance” of
    the limits of his authority when conducting a routine <i>Highway Traffic

    the context of a single inappropriate question in what was otherwise a proper

    turn next to the seriousness of the breach.  Where, as is conceded here,
    the fairness of the trial would not suffer were the evidence to be admitted,
    the seriousness of the breach will be the key consideration in determining
    inadmissibility under s. 24(2).  Were the court to admit evidence obtained
    through a serious breach of an accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights, the admission
    of that evidence could reasonably be seen as judicial condonation of the
    unconstitutional conduct of the police. That condonation would tend to bring
    the administration of justice into disrepute:  K. Roach, <i>Constitutional
    Remedies in Canada</i> (Aurora, Ont.:  Canada Law Book, 1994) at para. 10.1564. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    my review of this record, there are four factors that are significant in
    measuring the seriousness of the s. 8 breach.  First, there was no urgency
    or exigent circumstances justifying Lipkus’s conduct.  To the contrary, the
    situation as described by Lipkus was the opposite of one in which there was
    urgency.  On his evidence, he routinely used <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> stops
    to improperly question passengers in the detained vehicles.  The absence
    of any urgency tends to make the violation more serious.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second important consideration is the characterization of the conduct by
    Lipkus that amounted to the <i>Charter</i> violation.  As the trial judge
    found, Lipkus did not act deliberately or wilfully in breaching Harris’s
    rights.  He did, however, show an unreasonable ignorance of the scope of
    his authority.  The unreasonable nature of Lipkus’s mistake as to the scope
    of his authority means that he cannot be said to have acted in good faith
    when he requested identification:  <i>Buhay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 122-23.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Police
    misconduct resulting in a <i>Charter</i> violation can be placed on a continuum
    for the purposes of accessing the seriousness of that conduct.  Lipkus’s
    conduct falls somewhere between the two extremes of a good faith error and
    a blatant disregard for constitutional rights.  Having regard to the manner
    in which Lipkus conducted himself, I would place his breach considerably
    nearer the good faith end of that continuum:  see <i>R. v. Kitaitchik</i> (2002),
    166 C.C.C. (3d) 14 at 26-27 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The characterization of the police conduct tends against describing the
    breach as serious.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third factor to be considered is the nature of the breach viewed from the
    perspective of those whose rights are infringed.  I cannot accept the Crown’s
    characterization of this breach as “minimally intrusive”.  The use of the
    broad powers associated with <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> stops to routinely
    investigate passengers who have nothing to do with the concerns justifying
    those stops must have a significant cumulative, long-term, negative impact
    on the personal freedom enjoyed by those who find themselves subject to this
    kind of police conduct.  While for persons in some segments of the community,
    these stops may be infrequent, this record suggests that for others the stops
    are an all too familiar part of their day-to-day routine.  Viewed from the
    perspective of those who are most likely to find themselves stopped and questioned
    by police, I think this form of interrogation is anything but trivial.  It
    seems to me at some point it must become provocative.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    brings me to the fourth, and I think determinative, factor relevant to the
    seriousness of this specific breach of s. 8.  The trial judge accepted Lipkus’s
    evidence that Harris was not wearing a seatbelt and that the officer informed
    him of such and was considering giving Harris a ticket for the seatbelt violation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Had
    Lipkus decided to give Harris a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt, he was
    entitled under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> to ask Harris for identification
    so that he could issue the ticket.  He was entitled to do this even if, as
    the law stood at the time, Harris was under no statutory duty to provide
    identification.<a href="#_ftn4"

    for the purposes of giving Harris a ticket for the seatbelt violation, if
    Harris provided the identification, Lipkus could, under the authority of <i>Brown</i>,
    conduct a CPIC inquiry using that identification.  Had this occurred, the
    inquiry would of course yielded the same results as the inquiry actually
    conducted by Lipkus.</p>

    trial judge did not refer to the possibility that Lipkus may have requested
    identification from Harris for the purpose of giving him a ticket, had he
    not erroneously believed that he could ask Harris for identification as part
    of his routine procedure.  Presumably, the possibility of getting identification
    from Harris in connection with a seatbelt violation was irrelevant to the
    trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis.  In my view, it does have relevance to that
    inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is a fair inference that had Lipkus properly understood the limits of his
    authority on a <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> investigation, he would have turned
    his mind specifically to whether he should issue a ticket to Harris for not
    wearing a seatbelt.  I think it is a fair inference that had Lipkus understood
    that he needed a specific reason for requesting identification from the passenger,
    he would have adverted to the seatbelt violation and requested an identification
    for the purposes of issuing a ticket to Harris.  There is no reason to think
    Harris would have responded any differently had Lipkus requested identification
    for the purpose of giving Harris a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt.  In
    my view, Harris would have felt just as compelled to answer the question
    and would have identified himself.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of this leads me to conclude that Lipkus had available to him lawful means
    by which he could have obtained Harris’s identification and proceeded in
    exactly the way he did.  The events that followed Harris’s identification,
    culminating in the seizure of the cocaine, would have unfolded in exactly
    the same way had Lipkus requested identification for the purposes of giving
    Harris a ticket.  </p>

    to use lawful means to obtain the evidence as indicative of the officer’s
    blatant disregard for the subject’s <i>Charter </i>rights, thereby making
    the breach more serious:  see <i>Collins</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 29;  <i>Buhay</i>, <i>supra</i>,

    second line of authority finds that the availability of the same evidence
    through lawful means diminishes the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach.  In
    these cases, however, the courts have concluded that the police acted in
    good faith, reasonably believing they were entitled to do that which was
    ultimately held to be unconstitutional.  The combined effect of a good faith
    error by the police and the availability of the same evidence through lawful
    means significantly diminishes the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach:  see <i>R.
    v. Duarte </i>(1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 23 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Wong</i> (1990),

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts of this case do not fit perfectly into either line of authority.  First,
    it cannot be said that Lipkus’s decision to request identification from Harris
    under his misconception of his general powers associated with <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> stops, rather than pursuant to the specific power associated
    with giving Harris a ticket for a seatbelt violation, displayed a blatant
    disregard for <i>Charter</i> rights.  This is not a case where the officer’s
    conduct suggests a “shortcut” around procedural protections such as the requirement
    of a warrant.  As it turns out, Lipkus was entitled to do exactly what he
    did.  He was simply wrong as to the basis upon which he could proceed as
    he did.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the facts of this case do not suggest a blatant disregard for <i>Charter</i> rights,
    the facts also do not fall into those cases that treat the availability of
    an alternative means of obtaining the evidence as significantly diminishing
    the seriousness of the violation.  Lipkus did not act in good faith, but
    rather acted on an unreasonable misunderstanding of the scope of his powers.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    availability of the same evidence through lawful means does not mitigate
    the seriousness of the breach as much as it would had Lipkus acted in a reasonable
    good faith belief that he was entitled to question Harris.  I am, however,
    satisfied that it does diminish the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach.  Lipkus
    had the lawful authority to ask Harris exactly the same question that he
    in fact asked him.  There is a strong likelihood that had he turned his mind
    to the seatbelt violation, Lipkus would have requested identification for
    that purpose, would have received exactly the same answer from Harris, would
    have conducted exactly the same CPIC inquiry, would have obtained exactly
    the same information, and would have proceeded exactly as he did.  Lipkus’s
    error as to the reason he was entitled to demand identification had no effect
    on the nature of the question, Harris’s response, or the events subsequent
    to that response.  The availability of a lawful basis to ask the question
    had Lipkus turned his mind to it, in my view, renders the breach less serious
    than it otherwise would have been.</p>

    that the trial judge erred in holding that the respondent’s rights under
    ss. 9 and 10(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> had

    J.A. would also hold that the trial judge did not err in finding that Constable
    Lipkus breached Harris’ right to be free from an unreasonable search and

    Doherty J.A., I conclude that the trial judge erred in holding that Constable
    Lipkus breached Harris’ right to be free from an unreasonable search and
    seizure pursuant to s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  For the same reasons as
    set out by Doherty J.A., I would also admit the evidence under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i>, in the face of what he found to be a s. 8 breach.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching my conclusion, I have accepted the following findings of fact by
    the trial judge.  Lipkus had grounds to stop the vehicle in which Harris
    was a passenger and to ask the driver for his identification documents.  Further,
    he acted properly when he directed the occupants to keep their hands where
    he could see them.  He had seen Harris moving his hands towards the small
    of his back and he was understandably concerned about safety.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    he approached the car, Lipkus observed that Harris did not have his seatbelt
    fastened.  He asked Harris and the other passenger for identification.  While
    he had contemplated giving Harris a ticket for failing to wear a seatbelt,
    that was not the reason he requested identification.  Rather, he testified
    that he routinely asked passengers in vehicles that he had stopped for <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, purposes to identify themselves.  He
    did this in order to check their names through the Canadian Police Information
    Centre (“CPIC”) from which he might obtain information about their driver’s
    licences, criminal records, whether persons were on probation or bail, or
    whether they were under some “level of surveillance”.  In short, Lipkus checked
    the police data bank to apprise himself of any information the police had
    stored about the person.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    Harris identified himself, Lipkus conducted a CPIC check which revealed that
    Harris was on bail and that his bail order provided for a curfew which had
    long since passed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that Harris was detained after Lipkus ordered him to keep
    his hands in open view and that Harris felt compelled to identify himself
    when Lipkus asked him to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, Lipkus did not breach Harris’ s. 8 rights when he asked him to identify
    himself.  I make three points that underlie my conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    Lipkus’ request for Harris’ name did not in itself constitute an unreasonable
    search and seizure under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  When he provided his
    name, Harris revealed nothing of a personal and confidential nature about
    himself.  His name did not touch on a “biographical core of personal information
    which individuals in a free and democratic society would wish to maintain
    and control from dissemination to the state”, nor did it reveal any “intimate
    details of [his] lifestyle and personal choices” as would be required to
    be protected under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>:  see <i>R. v. Plant</i> (1993),
    84 C.C.C. (3d) 203 at 213 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Harris
    had little, if any, expectation of privacy in his name.  People routinely
    identify themselves in a wide range of contexts and situations.  Generally,
    an individual’s identity is broadly known within his or her community and
    can be easily ascertained by others.  In this case, for example, Lipkus might
    have asked the driver or the other passenger for Harris’
    name.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    date, courts have not held that a person’s identity is constitutionally protected
    under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In <i>R. v. Grant</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C.
    (3d) 250 (Ont. C.A.), police officers stopped and questioned the accused
    in circumstances that gave rise to this court concluding that he had been
    arbitrarily detained.  On stopping the accused, the police asked him what
    was going on and then asked him for his name and address.  The accused identified
    himself by producing an OHIP card.  Subsequent questioning led to the accused
    admitting he possessed marijuana.  At para. 33, Laskin J.A., for the court,
    said: “The divide between questions that begin a search and questions that
    do not is sometimes not easy to draw.  In this case, I am not persuaded that
    the police’s question to the appellant ‘if he had anything that he shouldn’t’ began
    a search.  In my view, the search began, at the earliest, after the appellant
    admitted to possession of the marijuana”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clearly,
    the court in <i>Grant</i> did not consider that the police officer’s request
    for the accused’s name, even in circumstances where the accused had been
    arbitrarily detained, constituted a search that warranted protection under
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Moreover, in <i>R. v. Grafe</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C.
    (3d) 267 (Ont. C.A.), the court had affirmed the principle that there is
    a right for police officers to ask questions even when there was no belief
    that an offence has been committed.  A police officer’s right to ask questions
    does not depend on there being a duty on a citizen to answer. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in my view, Lipkus did not conduct an unreasonable search and seizure by
    obtaining the information about Harris contained in the CPIC system.  This
    information, which included the details of a bail order, had been entered
    into the system on an earlier date.  As a national repository of police information,
    CPIC is a vital shared resource within
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    law enforcement.  As such, maintaining the CPIC system is a normal law enforcement
    function.  There is nothing improper for law enforcement agencies to maintain
    these types of records.  Rather, doing so is an essential and important part
    of legitimate law enforcement activities.  The information that is in issue
    on this appeal, information about a bail order, originated in a public court
    process and as such, would be available in the court files.  The bail order
    is the paper record of the court reflecting the order made in a public courtroom.  Once
    entered in the CPIC system, this information was to be made available to
    law enforcement officers who had access to that system. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, an individual such as Harris, does not have a reasonable expectation
    of privacy with respect to information in CPIC, at least insofar as police
    officers are concerned.  A reasonable and prudent individual would assume
    that information about him or her emanating from a public court process will
    be available to police officers through an information data system such as
    CPIC.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue arises in this case, however, because Lipkus was only able to access
    the CPIC information after Harris had identified himself.  Thus, the argument
    goes, by asking his name, Lipkus was in effect conducting a search and seizure
    with respect to the information in the system.  Had he not asked Harris’ name,
    he would not have been able to make the link to that information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    may be so, however, I do not think that it changes the fact that Harris did
    not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the information
    about the bail order, at least insofar as police officers were concerned.  The
    fact is that the information was available to law enforcement officers and
    access to it by a police officer could not result in an intrusion upon a
    reasonable privacy interest so as to constitute a search within the meaning
    of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this case is distinguishable from <i>R. v. Mellenthin</i> (1992),
    76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), where the Supreme Court of Canada found that
    a police officer’s questions and subsequent seizure of a bag of marihuana
    breached the accused’s s. 8 rights.  In that case, the accused was pulled
    over for a roadside check of the roadworthiness of his car.  The police officer
    questioned the accused about a bag in the back of the car.  The accused’s
    answers eventually led the officer to seize the bag in which he found narcotics.  Cory
    J. concluded that the officer did not have authority to question the accused
    about the bag or to seize the bag.  He found that the improper questions
    constituted the beginning of an unreasonable search that resulted in the
    unreasonable seizure of the bag.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is a different case.  In <i>Mellenthin</i>, the police officer did not have
    any information about the bag or its contents.  He had no basis to suspect
    that the bag contained narcotics.  In the circumstances of a random stop,
    he had no authority to ask the accused about the bag or to eventually seize
    it. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    contrast, in this case, the information about Harris’ bail order was already
    in the police data system and Lipkus was entitled to access that system.  Harris
    had no reasonable expectation that the information would be kept private
    from police officers in any circumstances.  I do not think that obtaining
    Harris’ name which enabled Lipkus to access the CPIC information can be equated
    to asking and then seizing a bag which was in the sole possession of the
    accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third part of my analysis addresses the fact that the trial judge found that
    Harris felt compelled to identify himself when asked.  It is suggested that
    the compulsion to answer played a role in turning the request for his name
    into an unconstitutional search and seizure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is worth noting that there was nothing improper about the compulsion.  Lipkus
    directed the occupants of the car to keep their hands where he could see
    them.  In the circumstances, he was entitled to do so for safety purposes.  The
    compulsion, as found by the trial judge, resulted from this direction, nothing
    else. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, compulsion to provide information does not in itself constitute
    the basis for an unreasonable search and seizure.  As the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    pointed out in <i>R. v. Tessling</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.),
    not every examination by the state will constitute a “search” for constitutional
    purposes.  It is only where the state’s actions result in an intrusion upon
    some reasonable privacy interest of an individual, will a government action
    constitute a search within the meaning of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Thus,
    the protection of privacy interest is at the core of s. 8 rights and infringement
    of a constitutionally protected privacy interests is an essential prerequisite
    to a finding that there had been a breach under s. 8.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I said above, I do not consider that the question asking Harris to identify
    himself and the follow-up search of the CPIC system constituted an intrusion
    upon a reasonable privacy interest of Harris.  Thus, the fact that Harris
    may have felt compelled to identify himself, does not operate, in my view,
    to render what was otherwise constitutional into a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that counsel for Harris did not argue either at trial or on appeal that
    his client’s rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> to be free from self-incrimination
    had been breached.  Accordingly, I need not address that issue.  I raise
    this point only to add that even if it were found that in the circumstances
    of this case there had been a breach of s. 7, I would still admit the evidence
    of the narcotics seized under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  I would do
    so for essentially the same reasons that Doherty J.A. would admit the evidence
    in the face of what he found to be a s. 8 breach.  </p>
