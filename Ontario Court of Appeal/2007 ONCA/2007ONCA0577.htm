    a Friday evening in late November, 2000, around 11:30 p.m. the complainant
    took a cab to a bar she frequently went to with friends. She only had $20
    for the cab and drinks but expected her boyfriend would arrive following
    his night shift to drive her home. When he did not arrive, she was offered
    a ride with an acquaintance but declined because she did not feel she knew
    him well enough.  Instead, she went with Garcia, a longstanding friend of
    her boyfriend. He had arranged for the appellant Hoohing to drive her home.
    However, rather than take her home, he brought her to Garcia’s apartment.
    The complainant protested when the appellant turned onto Garcia’s street.  He
    did so anyway, telling her they were just stopping briefly to have a beer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    they arrived, Garcia, the appellant Buckle, another man whom the complainant
    knew as “Lawrence”, and a woman friend of Garcia were also present. The woman
    absented herself to the bedroom and the men put on a pornographic movie and
    began drinking beer. The complainant went to use the washroom. While she
    was in there, the appellant Buckle entered and raped her both vaginally and
    anally, though she yelled for him to stop. After Buckle left, Garcia entered.
    The complainant asked him why he had not come in and stopped Buckle when
    he heard her yelling. Garcia took out his penis and asked her to
    “suck him off”. She refused and left the bathroom.</p>

    Lawrence came behind her and when he rubbed his penis against her, she scratched
    it.  He called her a “bitch” and struck her on the head. The appellant Hoohing
    then intervened, told the others to leave her alone, and told her he would
    give her a ride home. She left the apartment and got into the back of a van
    with the appellant Hoohing and Lawrence in the front. Instead of driving
    her home, Hoohing told
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    police in March, 2001. She said that she wanted to forget about it but was
    unable to. She also did not want to tell her boyfriend, fearing he might
    feel uncomfortable with her.</p>

    trial, the appellant Buckle denied having intercourse with the complainant
    that night. He explained the presence of his semen on her skirt by saying
    that he and the complainant had consensual intercourse seven or eight times
    prior to that evening and twice afterward. The complainant denied any sexual
    involvement with the appellant. She said she did not know him before that

    appellant Hoohing admitted having intercourse with the complainant in the
    backseat of the van that night but claimed it was consensual and was instigated
    by the complainant. During cross-examination by the Crown, he said that he
    had had intercourse with her previously in similar circumstances, that is,
    in the back seat of the van with
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellant Buckle also raises two
    further alleged errors:</p>

    he revoked the appellant’s bail of his own motion and without giving counsel
    an opportunity to make submissions, causing the appellant prejudice and the
    appearance of unfairness.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(4)       The trial judge erred by not leaving with the jury the possibility
    that they could infer that it was unlikely that the appellant raped the complainant
    when, according to him, they had consensual intercourse after the alleged
    sexual assault.</p>

    at trial and on appeal, defence counsel objected to the way the trial judge
    described the first prong of the <i>W.(D.)</i> approach, where he said “…if
    you accept the evidence <i>favouring the particular accused</i> … and find
    it to be factually true <i>when weighed against the contradictory evidence</i> you
    must acquit that accused on that count.” [Emphasis added.<span lang=EN-US>]</span> The
    appellants submit that the trial judge added the words
    “when weighed against the contradictory evidence” to the formulation first
    set out by Cory J. in <i>W.(D.)</i> and to the formulation in the standard
    charge forms prepared by Watt J. They say this had the effect of asking the
    jury to choose between the version of the accused and that of the complainant.
    The appellant Buckle also submits that it was an error for the trial judge
    to refer to the evidence “favouring” the accused rather than just to the
    evidence of the accused, as the jury need only accept the evidence of the
    accused to acquit even if they do not accept other evidence that favours
    or supports that accused.</p>

    it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have followed the formulation
    of Cory J. in <i>W.(D.)</i>, I do not agree that he erred on either account.
    Prior to dealing with the jury’s approach and the <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction,
    the trial judge gave the jury a detailed review of the evidence wherein he
    delineated all of the evidence favourable to each accused as well as the
    evidence relied on by the Crown. He also pointed out inconsistencies in the
    evidence of the witnesses. In that context, much of what he outlined was
    evidence favourable to one or more of the three accused and could properly
    be taken into account by the jury when considering the first prong of <i>W.(D.)</i>. </p>

    trial judge properly told the jury that they are not compelled to choose

    also properly told the jury that they were to weigh the evidence cumulatively
    and not in isolation. A jury does not consider an accused’s version of events
    in isolation as if the Crown had led no evidence. When the jury is applying
    the first two prongs of the three-pronged test in <i>W.(D.), </i>they are
    deciding whether they accept the accused’s version of events or whether it
    leaves them with a reasonable doubt. Clearly they can only do that by assessing
    the accused’s evidence and the other evidence that favours the accused in
    the context of all the evidence.  See <i>R. v. Hull</i>, [2006] O.J. No.

    ). The evidence of any witness, including an accused, may be believable standing
    on its own, but when other evidence is given that is contradictory, or casts
    doubt on the accuracy or reliability of the witnesses’ evidence, that evidence
    may no longer be believable, or in the case of an accused, may no longer
    raise a reasonable doubt.</p>

    court recently considered the same impugned wording in the case of <i>R.

    However, the court did not consider the language fatal because it does not
    invite the jury to choose between the two versions but recognizes that the

    was cavalier about making suggestions about people. The trial judge refused
    to allow defence counsel to pursue the line of cross-examination, ruling
    that the probative value of the evidence was significantly outweighed by
    its prejudicial effect. He agreed with Crown counsel that the situation was
    similar to the decision of this court in <i>Riley </i>insofar as the inquiry

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in this ruling. In his submission,
    the “false” allegation by the complainant was not a collateral matter but
    related directly to the sexual assault she was alleging occurred. He submitted
    further that it could be used to show animus by the complainant against the
    appellant Hoohing because she falsely identified his brother. In making this
    latter suggestion, appeal counsel acknowledged that trial counsel did not
    make this submission to the trial judge, but says that it would nevertheless
    have been open to the jury to draw this inference.</p>

    also a case where the accused was charged with sexual assault. Defence counsel
    wished to cross-examine the complainant about another allegation she had
    made of sexual assault against another man, then to call that man to say
    the allegation was false. The trial judge ruled that the proposed line of
    questioning was irrelevant. This court affirmed the decision of the trial
    judge. The court stated that the only relevancy would be to establish a pattern
    of false allegations by the complainant. However, to do that, the defence
    would have to be able to prove that the other allegation was false. In that
    case, the other man had been charged and acquitted, but that acquittal did
    not prove that the complainant’s testimony had been fabricated. The court
    concluded that the proposed cross-examination was on a collateral matter
    and was essentially an attack on the general character of the complainant
    and that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion to exclude it.</p>

    same issue was faced by this court in the case of <i>R. v. A.R.B</i>. (1998),
    41 O.R. (3d) 361.  In that case, the appellant was convicted of sexually
    assaulting his fourteen year old adopted daughter. The complainant had alleged
    that her foster brothers had also sexually assaulted her. Counsel for the
    appellant wanted to cross-examine the complainant on her allegations about
    her brothers, then call the brothers to deny the allegations. The trial judge
    refused, applying <i>Riley</i>. Finlayson J.A. for the majority of this court
    upheld the decision of the trial judge. Moldaver J. A. dissented on the basis
    that the proposed evidence in that case was not collateral because it was
    capable of resolving an essential issue in the case which was the appellant’s
    opportunity to commit the offences in the conditions that prevailed in that
    household. Moldaver J.A. referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>R. v. B.A.W</span></i><span lang=EN style='color:black;
'>., </span>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 811  where McLachlin J. distinguished
    between evidence that is collateral because it goes only to general credibility
    as opposed to evidence that goes to a live issue in the case. Moldaver J.A.
    observed that, unlike in the case before him, the evidence in <i>B.A.W. </i>and
    in <i>Riley </i>was “designed to portray the complainant as the type of person
    who should not be believed because she had a propensity to make up false
    accusations” (<i>A.R.B., supra</i> at 374).<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the analysis from both opinions in <i>A.R.B.</i> is instructive
    for application in this case. First, Moldaver J.A. was only prepared to allow
    the line of questioning if it addressed a live issue in the case other than
    the complainant’s alleged propensity to make up false allegations. However,
    it was that latter inference that defence counsel in this case wished the
    jury to draw from the proposed questioning about the incorrect identification
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Lawrence. Second, as this was not an identification case, there was no relevance
    to the questioning to show inability to accurately identify someone. Third,
    the suggestion of animus against Hoohing was not made by trial counsel, nor
    does it bear any scrutiny. It would be based on the premise that the complainant
    made a knowingly false allegation that she knew would be proved false, in
    an effort to help her case and to hurt Hoohing. However, by making a deliberately
    false statement that would be shown to be false, the complainant would only
    hurt her own case, which would help Hoohing. Finally, the way the complainant
    made the identification when she thought she recognized “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Lawrence” in the courtroom, by saying that he looked like him except he was
    missing the large wart on his nose, suggested that she was making a mistake,
    not telling a lie. <i></i></p>

    denial of natural justice. She outlined several concerns about differences
    that the jury might now observe in the courtroom now that the appellant was

    the trial judge should have asked for submissions from defence counsel before
    he made his decision, he corrected his error the next morning, allowing her
    to make submissions on whether the order was appropriate and could be implemented

    in accordance with s. 523(2) of the <i>Code</i>. Although rarely used mid-trial,
    and even more rarely on a judge’s own motion, this power is an important
    aspect of the ability of a trial judge to control the trial process—in this
    case to ensure that the accused will appear to the conclusion of the trial.
