    higher cost of living in London, England where he resides. The mother cross-appealed

    parties were married in 1987 and divorced in 1998. In the divorce judgment,
    the mother was granted custody of the three children, who were then 8, 6
    and 4 years old, child support in accordance with the <i>Guidelines</i>,
    some
    “add-ons” including a portion of the children’s day-care expenses and two-thirds
    of the children’s health expenses not covered by the father’s plan. The judgment
    also required the father to maintain a life insurance policy with the children
    named as beneficiaries. </p>

    2001, the father applied to vary the support and access provisions of the
    divorce judgment. That application resulted in an order, dated July 13, 2001,
    based on minutes of settlement which amended the divorce judgment by increasing
    the child support payable by the father as of August 1, 2000, in accordance
    with the father’s income from the new position he began in England in August
    2000, as well as by adjusting the add-ons and some other provisions. The
    order also incorporated a provision from the minutes of settlement that the
    parties’ agreement was conditional on the accuracy of the disclosure of the
    father’s total employment income and benefits. The order required significant
    disclosure by the father of the financial details of his new employment through
    production to the mother’s counsel of documentation, including his contract
    of employment, tax returns and details of benefits.</p>

    father failed to make the financial disclosure required by the divorce judgment
    and by the order of July 13, 2001. The mother wrote to the father on May
    17, 2002 and August 7, 2002 requesting compliance and was ultimately obliged
    to bring a motion for contempt, resulting in a court order of April 29, 2004
    requiring the father to provide the disclosure by May 30, 2004. The father
    did not comply with that court order, and on June&nbsp;3, 2004, he was found
    in contempt of court. The application under appeal was heard in November
    2004, after the father purged his contempt by making the required disclosure.</p>

    the issue of the level of child support, the application judge ordered the

      <st1:place

      U.K.</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.K.</st1:country-region>
    income into Canadian funds under s. 20 of the <i>Guidelines</i>, she declined
    to reduce the amount payable by taking into account the higher cost of living
    in the

    than in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . She also declined to exercise her discretion under s. 4(b) of the <i>Guidelines</i> to
    find that the higher cost of living made the table amount inappropriate or
    that it would constitute an
    “undue hardship” under s. 10 of the <i>Guidelines</i>. </p>

    the issue of whether the new amount ordered should be made retroactive, the
    application judge applied and weighed the criteria set out in the following

    577 (C.A.); <i>Marinangeli v. Marinangeli </i>(2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 40 (C.A.); <i>S.

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that as a result of the father’s failure to pay
    the higher <i>Guidelines </i>amount of child support in accordance with his
    income and his failure to disclose that income, it did not appear that the
    children’s reasonable financial needs were being met and that the father’s
    conduct was blameworthy. Furthermore, the application judge noted that the
    mother had been required to increase her line of credit to meet the children’s
    expenses, although she had also been reducing her long-term mortgage debt.
    The application judge was concerned about the mother’s delay in bringing
    the application, but was satisfied that she had been trying to pursue the
    issue with the father out of court. </p>

    application judge concluded, based on the record before her, that “the obligation

    obligation,” but felt that she could not condone the father’s conduct in
    breaching court orders: [2006] W.D.F.L. 2169 at para. 89 [emphasis added].
    Weighing the factors together, the application judge awarded retroactive
    child support from January 1, 2003, but not from August 2000.</p>

    J. begins his majority reasons by pointing out that the issue of “retroactive” child
    support is a misnomer, because the child support sought is only retroactive
    in the sense that it had not been ordered to be paid during the relevant
    period, even though it was owed in accordance with the <i>Guideline</i>s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    discussing the factors a court is to consider prior to ordering retroactive
    child support, he stressed that such awards should not be seen as exceptional
    (at para.&nbsp;97): </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It cannot only
    be exceptional that children are returned the support they were rightly due.
    Retroactive awards may result in unpredictability [for the payor parent],
    but this unpredictability is often justified by the fact that the payor parent
    chose to bring that unpredictability upon him/herself. A retroactive award
    can always be avoided by appropriate action at the time the obligation to
    pay the increased amounts of support first arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache
    J. identified four factors that should be considered when determining whether
    to order a retroactive award: </p>
  <p>            (1)       unreasonable delay by the recipient parent in applying
    for the support; </p>
  <p>            (2)       conduct of the payor spouse; </p>
  <p>            (3)       circumstances of the child; and </p>
  <p>            (4)       hardship occasioned by the retroactive award.</p>
  <p>He further indicated that none of these factors is decisive, and that “a
    court should strive for a holistic view of the matter and decide each case
    based on its particular factual matrix” (para. 99). </p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(1)
          Unreasonable delay by the recipient parent</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a factor because of the payor parent’s interest in certainty. However,
    because the right to child support is the right of the child, any delay by
    the recipient parent is merely a factor that allows the judge to “examine
    the balance between the payor parent’s interest in certainty and fairness
    to his/her children, and to determine the most appropriate course of action
    on the facts” (para.104).  In fact, it is the conduct of the payor parent
    that often determines the reasonableness of the delay by the recipient parent
    in bringing the application, including whether the payor parent informs the
    recipient parent of income increases in a timely manner and does not pressure
    or intimidate the recipient.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(2)
          Conduct of the payor parent</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache
    J. strongly condemns blameworthy payor parent conduct, that is, “anything
    that privileges the payor parent’s own interests over his/her children’s
    right to an appropriate amount of support”
    (para. 106). And: “[p]ut simply, a payor parent who knowingly avoids or diminishes
    his/her support obligation to his/her children should not be allowed to profit
    from such conduct” (para.107).</p>
  <h3><span

line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    includes considering the child’s needs both at the time when the support
    should have been paid as well as at the time of the application.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(4)
          Hardship occasioned by a retroactive award</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is the hardship that the payor parent may suffer because he or she will be
    paying out of today’s income for a past obligation and because the payor
    parent may have more children who also rely on him or her for support. In
    light of these considerations, the court should attempt to minimize hardship
    by structuring the payments in the best way possible for the payor. However,
    Bastarache J. also recognized that: “it will not always be possible to avoid
    hardship. While hardship for the payor parent is much less of a concern where
    it is the product of his/her own blameworthy conduct, it remains a strong
    one where this is not the case” (para. 116).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache
    J. also discusses how a court should assess and award the correct  amount
    of retroactive support, including the date from which it will be payable
    and the quantum. He concludes that the fairest retroactive date is the date
    when “effective notice” was given by the recipient spouse to the payor spouse
    that child support needed to be renegotiated. He stated that all that is
    required for effective notice is that the subject be broached. However, if
    after broaching the subject, the recipient parent does not pursue the matter,
    the payor parent may again begin to rely on the <i>status quo</i>. For that
    reason, Bastarache J. concluded that it will usually be inappropriate to
    select a date more than three years prior to the formal notice of the claim. </p>

    the date of retroactivity can be extended back in time for a payor parent
    who withholds information about a material change in circumstances, such
    as income increases that would entitle the child to increased support. In
    those circumstances, the presumptive date will be the date of the material
    change, as “[a] payor parent cannot use his/her informational advantage to
    justify his/her deficient child support payments” (para. 124).  </p>

    J. concludes as follows (at para. 125):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The proper approach
    [for determining the date of retroactivity] can therefore be summarized in
    the following way: payor parents will have their interest in certainty protected
    only up to the point when that interest becomes unreasonable. In the majority
    of circumstances, that interest will be reasonable up to the point when the
    recipient parent broaches the subject, up to three years in the past. However,
    in order to avoid having the presumptive date of retroactivity set prior
    to the date of effective notice, the payor parent must act responsibly: (s)he
    must disclose the material change in circumstances to the recipient parent.
    Where the payor parent does not do so, and thus engages in blameworthy behaviour,
    I see no reason to continue to protect his/her interest in certainty beyond
    the date when circumstances changed materially. A payor parent should not
    be permitted to profit from his/her wrongdoing.</p>

    terms of quantum, the <i>Guidelines</i> amount is the presumptive amount,
    subject to undue hardship under s. 10, or other circumstances recognized
    by the <i>Guidelines </i>in ss.&nbsp;3(2), 4 and 9. The quantum can also
    be adjusted by reducing the time period for retroactive payment in order
    to achieve fairness in all the circumstances, for example, where there has
    been some unreasonable delay by the recipient parent.</p>

    I stated earlier, the application judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme
    Court decision in <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al</i>., <i>supra</i>, when deciding
    this case. However, she did refer to the factors set out by the Supreme Court
    as well as to other additional factors. </p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    first addressed the needs of the children. She noted, correctly, that the
    objective is to provide the children with the standard of living they would
    have enjoyed had the family remained together, and that the <i>Guidelines</i> amount
    is presumptively appropriate to meet the needs of the children. Consequently,
    when a parent’s ability to pay support increases, the children’s needs are
    presumed to increase commensurately. The application judge had concluded
    earlier in her judgment that the reasonable financial needs of the three
    children were not being met at the level of support that was being paid.</p>

    application judge next considered the father’s blameworthy conduct. This
    included his failure to disclose his financial information in the face of
    the divorce decree, the parties’ agreement and several court orders culminating
    in a contempt finding, all at a time when he knew he was depriving his children
    of an increase in support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    next referred to the fact that the mother had to increase her debt-load during
    this period, but was also repaying her mortgage at an accelerated rate. Consideration
    of this factor is now excluded by the Supreme Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then considered the reason for the mother’s delay in commencing
    her application. The father’s first default in disclosing financial information
    under the court order was in August 2001, while the application was not commenced
    until March 2004. The record showed that the mother wrote to the father in
    May 2002 and in August 2002 requesting full disclosure in accordance with
    court orders. The father claimed he had moved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge addressed what she stated was the most significant
    consideration for not awarding retroactive child support, which was the financial
    burden that accumulated arrears would place on the father, because although
    his financial statements showed substantial income, he did not have accumulated
    capital. She concluded, therefore, that an obligation to pay arrears “<i>may</i> impact
    on his ability to meet the ongoing obligation.” [Emphasis added.] However,
    earlier in the reasons on the main appeal, the application judge had discussed
    the issue of undue hardship under s. 10 of the <i>Guidelines</i>. She concluded
    that undue hardship had not been shown and observed in that context that “[a]
    payor earning in excess of $300,000 bears a heavy onus in persuading a court
    that he will suffer undue hardship” (para. 49).</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded her analysis by saying that in order to strike
    a balance among the factors and not to condone the father’s conduct in breaching
    court orders which had the effect of thwarting the effectiveness of the variation
    provisions of the divorce judgment, she would make the increased child support
    order retroactive, but only back to January 1, 2003, that is, to just over
    one year prior to the date when the application was commenced in March 2004.</p>

line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the reasons of the Supreme Court in <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G</i>. required
    the application judge to place significant emphasis on the father’s conduct
    in this case.  He  breached the divorce decree and several court orders by
    failing to make the financial disclosure that he knew would require him to
    increase his child support payments. His blameworthy conduct escalated to
    the point that he was found in contempt of court. The Supreme Court effectively
    found that a payor parent should not be permitted to gain any advantage from
    engaging in blameworthy conduct of this kind. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the application judge took the father’s blameworthy conduct into account,
    she severely limited the retroactive award because of the possibility that
    a greater obligation “<i>may </i>impact<i> </i>on his ability to meet the
    ongoing obligation.” This concern, however, does not reflect the application
    judge’s earlier strong finding of no undue hardship on the husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
    the application judge did not consider, as was suggested by the Supreme Court,
    methods of payment that might alleviate or at least reduce the difficulty
    of making a retroactive payment. Rather, the effect of her order is to deprive
    the children of their support, in the amount of approximately $30,000, which,
    as teenagers, they could use to great advantage as they grow toward adulthood,
    and to allow the father to profit from his breach of obligation to the mother,
    to the children and to the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    again emphasize that the application judge did not have the benefit of the
    reasons of the Supreme Court when making her decision. However, those reasons
    make it clear that in this type of case, in conducting the balancing process,
    the blameworthy conduct presses very heavily on the scale in favour of awarding
    very significant, if not full retroactive child support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    would therefore set aside the decision of the application judge on the cross-appeal
    and order a new hearing with costs of the cross-appeal to the mother, the
    cross-appellant, in the amount of $2,500, as requested.</p>
