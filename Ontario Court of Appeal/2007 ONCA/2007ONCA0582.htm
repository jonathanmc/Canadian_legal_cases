    particular, the appellant claims that the trial judge erred in holding that the
    police were entitled to detain him for investigation and in finding that the
    police had reasonable grounds for arrest. The appellant also claims that the

    appellant's claim that the trial judge erred in holding that the police were
    entitled to detain him for investigation. Two minutes prior to stopping the
    vehicle in which the appellant was a passenger the police heard a radio
    broadcast concerning an attempted break and enter at a variety store. The
    broadcast indicated that two male suspects were involved, one wearing a red
    hoodie and one wearing a dark hoodie and dark pants, and that the suspects were
    riding in a burgundy Thunderbird. The officers believed that the vehicle in
    which the appellant was a passenger matched the vehicle described in the
    broadcast. They observed the vehicle go through an amber light and stop at a
    Tim Horton's. Two males emerged from the vehicle and were wearing clothing
    matching the clothing described in the broadcast. In our view, on these facts,
    it was open to the trial judge to find that an investigative detention was
    justified.</span></p>

    had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. While speaking to the driver of
    the vehicle at an open door at the side of the car, one of the officers could
    see into the backseat. He observed two cartons of cigarettes in plain view in a
    box on the back seat. Based on the way the cartons were positioned, the officer
    believed there were more cartons in the box. The officer testified that in his
    experience attempted break and enter broadcasts often relate to actual break
    and enters and that he believed the cigarettes were stolen.</span></p>

    the individuals and the officer's evidence about his experience with attempted
    break and enter broadcasts, in our view, the trial judge was entitled to accept
    the officer's belief about the existence of additional cigarettes as
    subjectively and objectively reasonable and therefore to find that the officer
    had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the appellant was in possession
    of stolen property and that the officer was entitled to effect an arrest.</span></p>
