    appellant was convicted, after a trial before a judge without a jury, of
    sexual assault, assault, and threatening death.  He received sentences totalling
    four years.  The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of the charges arose out of an incident that occurred at the apartment of
    R.L.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>*</span></a> on the
    evening of March 9, 2004.  R.L. testified that she was raped by the appellant,
    forced to perform fellatio, punched several times, and threatened with death
    if she told anyone about the attack.  The appellant testified that the sexual
    activity, including sexual intercourse, was consensual and that he did not
    hit or threaten R.L.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave detailed reasons for convicting the appellant.  In the end,
    he was convinced that R.L. was telling the truth and that the appellant’s
    testimony was untrue and did not leave him with any reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    ably argued several grounds of appeal.  Two of those grounds must succeed
    and I will address only those two grounds in these reasons.  First, the trial
    judge erred in determining an important factual issue by reference to his
    personal perception of how a
    “virile young man’s” penis would function in the course of sexual intercourse.  Second,
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of a Crown witness, Ms. S.  This
    misapprehension figured materially in the trial judge’s determination that
    Ms. S.’s evidence confirmed a significant portion of R.L.’s evidence relating
    to her relationship with the appellant prior to the incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    two errors require reversal.  I would quash the convictions and order a new
    trial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.L.
    testified that the appellant, who was younger than she was, would often tease
    her at work, sometimes making fun of her in a cruel way.  She indicated that
    after they had worked together for about two years she and the appellant
    began to jog together from time to time.  The appellant also took R.L. to
    a store to get her son’s skates sharpened and visited her apartment to fix
    her DVD player.  R.L. testified that, despite this social interaction, she
    was uncomfortable around the appellant because he often acted like a bully.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.L.
    testified that on one occasion the appellant made sexual advances towards
    her in his car after they had been jogging together.  R.L. told him that
    she was not interested, and the appellant eventually relented.  R.L. also
    indicated that after the incident in the car the appellant would contact
    her either on the telephone or over her computer.  In time, he began to insist
    that they engage in “phone” sex.  He threatened her with physical violence
    if she did not go along with his demands.  R.L. said she would pretend to
    engage in “phone” sex with him because she was afraid of him.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.L.
    testified that in November 2003, about three months before the incident giving
    rise to the charges, the appellant made sexual advances towards her while
    he was visiting her apartment.  He insisted that she have sex with him.  R.L.
    refused and the appellant man-handled her in a violent fashion.  R.L. became
    very upset and eventually the appellant stopped.  He apologized to her and
    then stayed at the apartment for quite some time talking with her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the weeks following this incident, the appellant would talk to R.L. at work
    and on the telephone.  He insisted that she was acting stupidly towards him
    and threatened her should she complain about his behaviour to anyone.  For
    some reason unknown to R.L., this aggressive behaviour stopped around Christmas
    2003.  The appellant told R.L. that she had misunderstood the events in the
    apartment in November.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant gave his version of the prior relationship in his testimony.  He
    agreed that he would joke with the appellant at work and sometimes joke with
    her about her age.  She was about ten years older than the appellant.  According
    to the appellant’s testimony, they became friends and would often speak on
    the telephone or over the computer.  They also jogged together on several
    occasions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that a sexual relationship developed between R.L. and
    him.  This relationship included “phone” sex and actual sexual activity including
    sexual intercourse.  The first act of sexual intercourse occurred in August
    2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.L.
    testified that the appellant contacted her a few days before March 9, 2004
    and told her that he had something for her son’s fish tank.  After cancelling
    one visit, the appellant arrived at R.L.’s apartment shortly before 9:00
    p.m. on the evening of March 9.  R.L.’s son was staying with her ex-husband
    and was not in the apartment.  </p>

    and the appellant talked for a while.  At about 10:50 p.m. R.L. told the
    appellant that she was tired and asked him to leave the apartment.  The appellant
    ignored the request and continued to talk to R.L. about different things.  He
    suggested that they look at R.L.’s family photographs.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the night wore on, the appellant’s mood became considerably darker, and R.L.
    became frightened.  The appellant insisted that they enter the bedroom.  R.L.
    resisted but eventually the appellant physically manoeuvred her into the
    bedroom.  R.L. said “please don’t”.  The appellant persisted and manoeuvred
    her towards the bed. </p>

    the bedroom, the appellant forced R.L. to partially undress and masturbate
    him.  When she resisted, he would tell her that she was not listening to
    what he was telling her to do.  After some time, the appellant removed R.L.’s
    pants and ripped her underwear away from her.  They struggled and the appellant
    forced his penis into R.L.’s vagina.  R.L. was crying, and the appellant
    put a pillow over her head.</p>

    testified that she felt a “splash” on her left leg when the appellant ejaculated.  Afterwards,
    he lifted himself off of her, got up from the bed, and put on his clothes.  R.L.
    became very upset when she realized that the appellant was not wearing a
    condom.</p>

  <p><b>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><b>(a)       The Trial Judge’s Rejection of the Appellant’s
      Evidence That the Condom Came Off When He Lost His Erection During Sexual
      Intercourse</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was common ground between R.L. and the appellant that he was not wearing
    a condom when he ejaculated.  Even on the appellant’s evidence, R.L. would
    not have consented to unprotected sex.  It therefore became important to
    determine whether the appellant was wearing a condom that came off during
    the sexual activity, or whether the appellant was never wearing one as alleged
    by the Crown.  The trial judge addressed this facet of the evidence at paragraph
    53 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Perkins explained
    that the condom came off his penis because he lost some of his erection and
    it became loose.  Then, he did not stop to put on any condom, but rather
    put his penis back into R.L. and carried on until he was about to ejaculate.  At
    that time, he withdrew and semen projected from his penis onto her leg. First
    of all, this man was 24 years old.  He appears to be in good health and there
    is no indication that he is not.  He had not ejaculated when he was losing
    his erection.  <u>I find it hard to believe that such was the case.  A virile
    young man with a full erection bound on having a climax would not lose his
    erection.  There is one reasonable interpretation.  He did not have a condom
    on at all.</u>  He just kept going with his sexual activity and pulled out
    spilling out seminal fluid on R.L.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was no medical or other expert evidence as to the functioning of the penis
    during sexual intercourse.  The trial judge’s conclusion that a “virile young
    man” in good health would not lose his erection during sexual intercourse
    was apparently based on his own perception of the physiology of the penis
    of a healthy, virile young man.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    so finding, the trial judge acted on his own initiative and without any notice
    to the parties.  Crown counsel did not argue in his closing submissions that
    the appellant’s explanation for losing his erection was medically implausible
    or that it was common knowledge that the event described by the appellant
    was highly improbable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and the Crown disagree as to the proper characterization of the
    trial judge’s comment.  Crown counsel submits that the trial judge was using
    his “common sense and human experience” to assess the plausibility of the
    appellant’s evidence.  He submits that this is pre-eminently the function
    of the trier of fact and that this court must defer to the trier of fact
    in the exercise of that function.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge effectively took judicial notice of
    how the penis of a normal, virile young man functions during sexual intercourse.  Counsel
    for the appellant contends that the trial judge went beyond the proper limits
    of judicial notice in doing so.  Counsel contends that the possibility of
    a healthy male losing his erection during sexual intercourse is not the sort
    of thing that is either known by everybody or readily capable of proof by
    resort to available sources of undisputed accuracy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s characterization of the trial judge’s comment is correct.  Whether
    a healthy young man can lose his erection during sexual intercourse is hardly
    a matter of “common sense”.  To the extent that it reflects the trial judge’s
    personal experience or understanding, it is not a substitute for evidence.  If
    the trial judge’s comment reflects his own understanding of the physiology
    of the penis, his understanding cannot be treated as representing the medical
    norm applicable to all persons such that it can be regarded as a fact in
    a criminal proceeding in the absence of any evidence.  I think the trial
    judge clearly reached outside of the evidence to find that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A virile young
    man with a full erection bound on having a climax would not lose his erection.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was entitled to go beyond the evidence to make findings of fact
    only if he could take judicial notice of that fact.  Judicial notice is an
    essential, regularly used, and often unnoticed, fact-finding mechanism.  As
    has been observed, trials would be interminable and fact-finding suspect
    without regular use of judicial notice to set the context and background
    for the real factual battle:  see I. Binnie, “Judicial Notice:  How Much
    is Too Much?” <i>Law Society of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Upper Canada Special Lectures 2003: The Law of Evidence</i> (

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fact-finding
    through judicial notice, however, has risks.  The “fact” judicially noticed
    may be wrong.  Judicial notice can also jeopardize trial fairness in that
    it may deny the parties an opportunity to challenge the existence of the
    fact of which the trial judge eventually takes judicial notice.  These risks
    require careful limits on the reach of judicial notice.  In
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , those limits are set out in <i>R. v. Find</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 97
    (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Spence</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Spence</i> at
    paras. 57-65, Binnie J. described judicial notice as a flexible fact-finding
    device.  The scope of judicial notice depends on the nature of the fact of
    which judicial notice is taken, and the centrality of that fact to a dispositive
    issue in the litigation.  If the fact is an adjudicative as opposed to legislative
    or social fact, the scope of judicial notice is narrowed.  Similarly, if
    the fact is central to a dispositive issue, resort to judicial notice is
    restricted. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    functioning of the penis of a normal, virile young man during sexual intercourse
    was an adjudicative fact in this proceeding.  On the authority of <i>Spence</i> at
    para. 53, judicial notice of an adjudicative fact will only be taken if that
    fact is:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(1)  so notorious
    and generally accepted as not to be subject of debate among reasonable persons;
    or </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) capable of
    immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources
    of undisputed accuracy. (Citing <i>R. v. Find</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    only is the fact of which the trial judge took judicial notice an adjudicative
    fact thereby limiting the scope of judicial notice, the fact was also central
    to a crucial issue in the case.  The trial judge effectively used the fact
    of which he took judicial notice to reject the evidence of the appellant
    concerning the condom.  The rejection of that evidence, given the appellant’s
    acknowledgement that R.L. would not consent to unprotected sex, all but decided
    the case against the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    find it impossible to say that the unlikelihood of a healthy young male losing
    his erection during sexual intercourse is so well known as to be a notorious
    fact that could not be the subject of debate among reasonable persons.  Certainly,
    there is nothing before this court to suggest that the fact assumed by the
    trial judge is capable of immediate and accurate proof by resort to some
    readily accessible source of indisputable accuracy.  To the contrary, the
    subject matter, a blend of human sexuality and physiology, suggests a variety
    of possible reactions within a broad norm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    that a trial judge’s decision to take judicial notice of a fact is entitled
    to some deference on appeal, I would still hold that the trial judge erred
    in law in taking judicial notice that a healthy young male’s penis would
    not lose its erection during sexual intercourse.  There is nothing that elevates
    that observation from the personal to the notorious or that offers any assurance
    of the accuracy of that observation.  The trial judge’s improper resort to
    judicial notice to reject a crucial part of the appellant’s evidence constitutes
    reversible error.  </p>
  <h2>(b)  The Alleged Misapprehension of Ms. S.’s Evidence</h2>

    often occurs where the complainant alleges sexual assault and the appellant
    contends that she consented, the Crown focused its submissions on the evidence
    of other persons that the Crown contended supported R.L.’s claim.  Ms. S.’s
    evidence fell into that category.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge addressed Ms. S.’s evidence at para. 44 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is apparent
    from both persons that Mr. Perkins wanted to engage in sexual intercourse
    over several months, but it is not apparent that such activity took place.  Rather,
    I do not find it to be the case.  [Ms. S.] is a friend of R.L. and lived
    in the same apartment building.  She saw R.L. several times a week.  It appears
    that R.L. and [Ms. S.] confided in each other.  <u>One would anticipate that
    if there was some relationship between the complainant and the defendant,
    [Ms. S.] would have been aware of it.  Her first awareness of any contact
    R.L. had with the defendant was after March 10, 2004.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended Ms. S.’s evidence.  First,
    he argues that the trial judge was wrong when he said that Ms. S. lived in
    the same apartment building as R.L.  Counsel is correct.  They did not live
    in the same apartment building.  This error is, however, of no significance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    next submits that there was no evidence that R.L. confided in Ms. S.  I agree
    that there is no direct evidence to support this finding.  However, the trial
    judge could reasonably infer from their long friendship, their regular contact,
    and the fact that R.L. confided to Ms. S. that she had been raped, that R.L.
    would confide in Ms. S. in respect of other personal matters.  I do not agree
    that the trial judge misapprehended this aspect of Ms. S.’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s main challenge to the trial judge’s fact-finding as it related
    to Ms. S. turns on the trial judge’s finding that Ms. S. did not know about
    any relationship between R.L. and the appellant before March 10, 2004.  The
    trial judge used Ms. S.’s ignorance of any relationship to infer that there
    was no prior sexual relationship and that the appellant was lying about the
    prior relationship.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s use of the inference that the appellant was not telling the
    truth about the prior relationship because R.L. had not told Ms. S. about
    the prior relationship is made explicit in para. 49:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The testimony
    of [Ms. S.] also provided supporting evidence to that of R.L. because it
    demonstrated that Mr. Perkins was not known to her as a male companion of
    R.L.  Her friendship with the complainant was close enough that she would
    have known.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no evidence as to when Ms. S. first became aware of the appellant much
    less any evidence about what she knew about the prior relationship between
    the appellant and R.L.  Neither R.L. nor Ms. S. was asked about what, if
    anything, Ms. S. knew about the relationship between R.L. and the appellant
    before March 10, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was wrong on the evidence when he indicated that Ms. S.’s first
    awareness of any contact between R.L. and the appellant was on March 10,
    2004.  It follows that his inference that the appellant was not telling the
    truth about the prior relationship is tainted because it flows from a primary
    finding of fact based on a misapprehension of evidence.  </p>

    trial judge’s misapprehension of the evidence is material to the outcome.  It
    ultimately played a significant role in the trial judge’s rejection of the
    appellant’s evidence and his acceptance of R.L.’s version of the prior relationship
    between her and the appellant.  The trial judge’s finding concerning the
    nature of the prior relationship was integral to the reasoning process that
    led to the conviction.  The misapprehension of the evidence was material
    and the verdict cannot stand: see <i>R. v. Lohrer</i> (2004), 193 C.C.C.
