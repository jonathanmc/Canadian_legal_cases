  <h2>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is another in a spate of recent cases in this court under
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s <i>Road Access Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.34.  The Act was passed
    to resolve disputes between neighbours that occur when the property of one
    neighbour is landlocked, and the only motor vehicle access to it is over
    a road on property owned by another neighbour.  The Act stipulates that the
    owner of the access road generally cannot close it without a court order.  Implicitly,
    however, the Act allows the owner to close the road without a court order
    if there is “alternate road access” to the landlocked property.  This appeal
    raises the question what constitutes “alternate road access”
    under the Act?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents are a group of cottagers who live year-round on a lot on the
    shores of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:Street
 w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Lake St. John.  The sole existing motor vehicle access to their cottages
    is over a road located on an adjacent lot.  The appellant, 2008795 Ontario
    Inc., now owns the adjacent lot.  The previous owner of the adjacent lot
    charged the cottagers a $500 annual fee for use and the maintenance of the
    access road.  2008795, however, demanded a four-fold increase in the user
    fee.  When the cottagers refused to pay it, 2008795 closed the road to them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2008795
    sued two of the cottagers in trespass for an injunction restraining them
    from using the access road.  The cottagers, in turn, sought an injunction
    preventing 2008795 from interfering with their use of the road to go to and
    from their cottages.  The two actions were consolidated and tried before
    Howden J.  He dismissed 2008795’s action for trespass, and granted the cottagers’
    request for an injunction on condition that they continue to pay a $500 annual
    user fee (or another fee directly related to the maintenance and repair cost
    of the existing road).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    its appeal, 2008795 argues that it was entitled to close its access road
    without a court order because of the existence of alternate road access to
    the cottagers’ properties.  It contends that the cottagers have alternate
    road access to their properties in one of two ways: over a municipally regulated
    unopened road allowance, or over the existing access road on payment of the
    user fee sought by the appellant.  I disagree.  In my view, the trial judge
    correctly concluded that alternate road access means motor vehicle access
    over another existing road.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal subject
    to 2008795’s right under the Act to apply to close the road.</p>

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Ramara.  The cottagers live on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 19 which is reserve land of the Mnjikaning First Nation.  The cottagers
    lease their properties from the Crown and pay an annual rent between $1,400
    and $1,500.  For many years the cottagers have driven to and from their leased
    properties over a gravel road that runs through
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18.  </p>

    1994 and 2003,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18 was owned by Joseph and Joan Carrick.  The Carricks fenced and gated
    their lot and gave each cottager a key which allowed access to the road on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18.  Each cottager paid the Carricks an annual fee of $500 for the use
    and maintenance of the road.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    October 2003, 2008795 asked each cottager to sign an access agreement.  Under
    the proposed agreement, each cottager would pay 2008795 an annual fee of
    $2,000 in exchange for the right to use the road on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18 between May and October and the appellant’s undertaking to maintain
    the road.  The evidence on how 2008795 arrived at the figure of $2,000 is
    vague.  The appellant claims that the fee is related to the cost of acquiring
    and maintaining the property.  However, the trial judge found at para. 67: “The
    fee suggested by the plaintiff prior to closure was fixed taking into account
    costs far beyond maintenance of the gravel road and was arbitrarily set.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of the cottagers refused to sign the access agreement, apparently for two
    reasons: they claimed the fee was excessive and they required the use of
    the road not for only half the year but year-round.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 1, 2003, 2008795 closed access to the road by changing the locks
    on the gate to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18.  Litigation ensued.  On January 20, 2006, in a thorough and well
    reasoned decision, the trial judge granted judgment in favour of the cottagers.</p>
  <h2>C.        THE ACT</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The
    Act was passed in 1978 to address confrontations that arise between those
    who use private roads and those who own them.  As the trial judge noted at
    para. 31 of his reasons, in introducing the legislation, the Honourable Mr.
    D. McKeough stated that the government intended
    “to prevent the arbitrary closing of private roads, especially in cottage
    country where owners or tenants are totally dependent on these roads for
    access to their property”:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <i>Hansard</i>, No. 75 (1 June 1978) at 3015.  My
    colleague, Juriansz J.A., also referred to the Act’s purpose in this court’s
    recent decision in <i>Blais v. Belange</i>r (2007), 54 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    9 at para. 43: “a primary purpose of the Act is to prevent landowners from
    resorting to self-help measures by providing a judicially supervised process
    for resolving disputes.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Act is a short statute containing just eight sections.  Only sections 1,
    2, 3 and 6 are germane to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    1 defines an “access road” as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A] road located
    on land not owned by a municipality and not dedicated and accepted as, or
    otherwise deemed at law to be, a public highway, that serves as a motor vehicle

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found – and correctly so – that the road over
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18 is an access road.  It meets all the requirements of the definition.  The
    road is on land not owned by a municipality; it is not a public highway;
    and, it serves as a motor vehicle access route to one or more parcels of
    land.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    2(1)(a), on which this appeal turns, provides that the owner of an access
    road requires a court order to close it if doing so would prevent “all road
    access” to another person’s property:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>2(1) No person
    shall construct, place or maintain a barrier or other obstacle over an access
    road, not being a common road, that, as a result, prevents all road access

    owned by that person unless,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) the person
    has made application to a judge for an order closing the road and has given
    ninety days notice of such application to the parties and in the manner directed

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, even though another person’s use of the access road amounts
    to a trespass, the owner of the road cannot act unilaterally under section
    2(1)(a).  In this case, 2008795 did unilaterally close the access road over
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18.  The question on this appeal is whether that closure prevented “all
    road access” to the cottagers’
    properties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span

    the owner of an access road cannot unilaterally close it under section 2(1)(a)
    if doing so would landlock another property, the owner need not tolerate
    its use or trespass by another in perpetuity.  The statute simply requires
    that the owner of the access road obtain a court order to close it.  The
    obvious purpose of requiring judicial authorization for closure is to avoid
    self-help measures and potentially violent confrontations among neighbours.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>3(1) The judge

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    persons using an access road, such as the cottagers in this case, cannot
    claim a legal right to do so under section 3(1)(b) for the sole reason that
    the road is an access road.  A legal right under section 3(1)(b) must be
    a legal right that exists apart from the Act.  Section 6(1) of the Act confirms
    this to be so.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Nothing in this
    Act shall be construed to confer any right in respect of the ownership of
    land where the right does not otherwise exist at law and nothing in this

    if the users of an access road could defend an application for closing it
    on the ground that the Act gives them a legal right to use the access road,
    then section 3(1)(b) would be rendered meaningless.  Our court made this
    very point in <i>992275 Ontario Inc. v. Krawczyk</i> (2006), 268 D.L.R. (4th)
    121 at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'> Finally, we
    note that if a finding that a road is an access road created a legal right
    to use the road within the meaning of s. 3(1)(b), the condition in s. 3(1)(b)
    would make no sense.  Under s. 3(1)(b), a landowner may apply to close an
    access road if the persons entitled to notice of the application to close
    the access road do not have a legal right to use it.  If the fact that the
    road is an access road itself established a legal right to use the access
    road, the condition in s. 3(1)(b) could never be met.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the Act confers on users of an access road only a very limited and temporary
    right to use the road to go to and from their properties.  At para. 45 of
    his reasons, in a passage with which I entirely agree, the trial judge summarized
    the limited statutory right given to users of an access road:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the end, and
    in the narrow situation to which it does apply, it creates no proprietary
    right or interest in the land over which the access road passes.  It provides
    an interim status to the access user whereby the access is immunized from
    an action in trespass when travelling on the access road in a motor vehicle
    for purposes of access only (see <i>Deluca; Cook’s Road Maintenance</i>).  He
    or she may not walk on it, use it for their own purposes (except vehicular
    passage for access purposes only), play on it, or disrupt it.  The access
    user cannot grant the use of the road to others.  The access user cannot
    convey any right to the road on a sale of the parcel of land; <i>Whitmell
    v. Ritchie</i>, supra.  The <i>Road Access Act </i>does not affect property
    rights, but subjects them to the continued limited use of the road unless
    and until the owner obtains, after proper notice and hearing, a court order
    closing the road on whatever conditions are imposed; <i>Cooks Road Maintenance</i>,
    at para. 45.  And, if another access road is subsequently provided, the access
    user’s continuing status under s. 2 ceases because alternate access would
    then exist.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the record does not disclose that any of the cottagers has a “legal right” under
    s. 3(1)(b) to use the access road over
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lot 18.  Thus, the cottagers would not seem to have a defence to an application
    to close the road.  2008795 has not, however, applied for a court order closing
    its access road.  Therefore, I will refrain from deciding whether if an application
    were brought, the presiding judge would have discretion to refuse the order
    even though the cottagers could not claim a legal right to use the road.  I
    turn to the issues on the appeal.</p>
  <h2>D.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I said in the overview, the Act implicitly allows the owner of an access
    road to close it without a court order as long as doing so does not prevent “all
    road access” to another piece of property – in short, as long as there is
    alternate road access to the other property.  The trial judge correctly noted
    that those seeking to use the access road, here the cottagers, bear the onus
    of showing that no alternate road access exists.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal, however, does not turn on onus.  Instead, it turns on what constitutes
    alternate road access under the Act.  Both sides agree that there is no other
    existing road access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 19.  2008795, nonetheless, contends that the cottagers have alternate
    road access to their properties in one of two ways: over an as yet unopened
    road allowance controlled by the Township of Ramara, or over the existing
    access road on payment of the $2,000 annual user fee sought by the appellant.  Whether
    either or these ways amounts to alternate road access raises a question of
    statutory interpretation.</p>
  <h2>1.         Does a municipally regulated unopened road allowance constitute
    alternate road access?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    unopened road allowance is a strip of Crown land reserved for the purpose
    of making a road when it may be required.  The evidence at trial showed that
    there were unopened road allowances around Lot 18 that if opened would provide
    alternate access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 19.  Experts from both sides agree that a viable road to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 19 could be built.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Township of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ramara controls and regulates the development of these unopened road allowances.  Opening
    them would require the Township’s permission and the passing of a by-law.  The
    cottagers have not sought the Township’s permission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the cottagers did obtain the Township’s approval for opening one of these
    road allowances, they would be responsible for all of the costs of constructing
    the road.  The expert evidence suggested that the cost of construction would
    exceed $450,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2008795
    makes two submissions on these unopened road allowances.  First, it says
    that an unopened road allowance can amount to alternate road access.  The
    trial judge, it contends, erred by holding that alternate road access must
    be on an existing road.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    2008795 says that for an unopened road allowance not to constitute alternate
    access, the cottagers must show that it is impossible to open the allowance
    and construct the road; mere cost, even substantial cost, or mere inconvenience
    is not enough.  2008795 contends that the Act is not intended to sanction
    what is otherwise a trespass because Lot 18 provides a more convenient route
    to the properties on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 19.  Here, the experts agree that a viable road could be built, albeit
    at a significant cost, and thus the cottagers cannot demonstrate that the
    closing of the access road on
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lot 18 would prevent “all road access” to their properties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not reach the appellant’s second submission on whether the appropriate
    test should be impossibility or substantial cost.  I do not do so because
    I agree with the trial judge that under the Act, alternate road access must
    be access over an existing road; an as yet unopened road allowance does not
    qualify.  The trial judge put his conclusion this way at para. 64 of his
    reasons: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In conclusion,
    I find no support in the <i>Road Access Act</i> or its jurisprudence to date
    nor in the evidence before me to find that the mere existence and alternate
    configuration of unopened road allowances, which cannot be used for vehicular
    traffic without municipal approval in the broad public interest and without
    construction and maintenance to municipal standards, constitute alternate
    road access within the <i>Road Access Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  Two strong indicators of legislative intent, both referred to by
    the trial judge, support this conclusion.  The first indicator is the use
    of the present tense of the verb “to serve” in the definition of access road
    in section 1 of the Act: “‘Access road’
    means a road located on land not owned by a municipality … that <i>serves</i> as
    a motor vehicle access route to one or more parcels of land.” [Emphasis added.]  A
    road that might be built in the future but does not now exist, does not “serve” as
    a motor vehicle access route.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second indicator of the legislature’s intent is the complete absence of any
    reference in the Act to the possibility that an unopened road allowance might
    constitute an access road.  Unopened road allowances are quite common in
    this province.  Indeed, they are common enough that, had the legislature
    intended for road allowances to qualify as alternate access roads, the scope
    of the legislation would have been restricted considerably.  Thus, if the
    legislature had intended that a potential future road might now qualify as
    an access road, I would have expected some statutory reference to this possibility,
    and to the consideration, such as feasibility and cost, under which it might
    so qualify.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    one indicator of legislative intent that might lend some support to the appellant’s
    position is the definition of road in section 1 of the Act: “‘[R]oad’ means
    land used <i>or intended for use</i> for the passage of motor vehicles.” [Emphasis
    added.]  However, in the context of the other provisions of the Act, especially
    the definition of access road, I do not think that the phrase “intended for
    use” refers to an unopened road allowance.  Instead, it likely refers to
    an existing road that has not or is not currently being used, but is intended
    for use in the future.  If the legislature had intended the more expansive
    meaning presumably it would have said so expressly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    that an unopened road allowance might amount to alternate road access seems
    contrary to the overall purpose of the Act.  The Act attempts to prevent
    confrontations between neighbours that may result from the arbitrary closing
    of an access road, and thus requires a court ordered closing.  Permitting
    the owner of an access road to close it without a court order because there
    is some unopened road allowance nearby would undermine the Act’s purpose.  This
    is a brief statute, which aims for a simple solution to the problem of the
    unilateral closing of access roads.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2008795
    argues that if alternate road access refers only to existing roads, the Act
    potentially forces a private land owner to endure an ongoing trespass even
    though a viable alternative is possible, albeit at some expense and inconvenience.  The
    answer to this argument lies in section 3 of the Act.  The private land owner
    need not endure a trespass; the owner may apply to the court to close the
    road.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2008795
    also pointed to several trial decisions, which it claimed supported the proposition
    that an unopened road allowance can constitute alternate road access.  See,
    for example, <i>Kanhai v. Elliott Lake Textiles &amp; Draperies Inc.</i> (2005),
    29 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 133 (S.C.J.); <i>Atkins v. Carter</i> (2004),
    23 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 311 (S.C.J.); <i>Bogart v. Thompson</i> (2002),
    1 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 199 (S.C.J.); <i>Vanalstyne v. Legg</i> (2001),
    42 R.P.R. (3d) 302 (S.C.J.).   The trial judge analyzed these decisions in
    detail and I do not propose to redo his analysis.  I agree with him that
    each case differs factually from this case.  Also, unlike the trial judgment
    in this case, none of the judgments in these cases considered the key question
    of the legislative intent of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps
    more significantly, this court has not adopted the appellant’s proposition.  On
    the contrary, although this court has not considered the issue directly,
    our previous jurisprudence does offer some limited support for my opinion.  In <i>Blais
    v. Belanger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 36, Juriansz J.A. interpreted the
    phrase “used or intended to be used” in the definition of a “road” under
    the Act to require that the road “exists contemporarily”.  Although Juriansz
    J.A. was specifically referring to an access road, presumably the definition
    of an access road should inform the definition of alternate road access.  It
    too should require contemporaneous existence: see also <i>553173 Ontario
    Ltd. v. Bank of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal</i> (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 617 (O.C.G.D.), aff’d (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, on basic principles of statutory interpretation, an alternate access
    road must be an existing road.  It cannot be an as yet unopened road allowance.  The
    remaining question is whether it may be the same road, but on payment of
    a user fee.</p>
  <h2>  2.       Does access over the existing access road on payment of a user
    fee constitute alternate road access?</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    oral argument in this court, 2008795 submitted that use of the existing access
    road on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 18 on payment of the requested $2,000 annual fee can constitute alternate
    road access under the Act.  Thus, 2008795 argues that when the cottagers
    refused to pay the fee, it was entitled to close the access road without
    a court order.  I disagree with this submission.</p>

    my view, alternate road access must be access over an existing and different
    road.  If access on the same access road but on payment of a fee could be
    considered alternate road access, then the owner of an access road could
    simply demand an excessive fee on threat of closing the road without a court
    order.  That appears to be one of the very situations the Act was passed
    to prevent.</p>

    course, parties can avoid the application of the Act by entering into an
    agreement for use of an access road, for example along the lines of the proposed
    access agreement tendered by 2008795 to each of the cottagers.  Indeed, the
    cottagers may be well advised to try to reach an access agreement with the
    appellant, because, as I said earlier, it does not appear that they have
    any defence to an application to close the road.  However, I do not regard
    use of the existing access road on payment of a fee to constitute alternate
    road access.  </p>
