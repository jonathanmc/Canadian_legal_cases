    S.O. 2000, c. 20 (the “<i>R.C.A.</i>”) is the governing statute.  It gives

    Austin was racing horses at Kawartha Downs Raceway and was advised to present

    Austin eventually provided a sample to McEachern after the sixth race, at
    around 6:30 p.m.  This sample had several problems.  Not only did the temperature
    register less than the required 90 degrees Fahrenheit, but the sample was
    less than the required 30 millilitres.  McEachern notified
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Austin of these deficiencies and asked him to return later to provide another
    sample.  The track judges at Kawartha Downs that day were Jeff Minler, William

    had received a cold sample from

    of the power to regulate and govern the conduct of racing and its participants
    is delegated to track judges who are onsite officials.  This delegated power
    includes the responsibility to perform certain investigative and adjudicative
    functions.  According to r. 6.28 of the <i>Rules of Standardbred Racing,
    2003</i>, track judges may </p>

    to any suspected crime or violation of these rules, the Act, or any matter

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    considering an allegation of bias or reasonable apprehension of bias, one
    starts from the premise that absent evidence to the contrary a tribunal is
    presumed to be fair and impartial.  The test to be applied when considering
    an allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias was set out by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Committee</i> <i>for Justice and Liberty v. Canada
    (National Energy Board)</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394, and recently restated
    in <i>Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259 at para. 60:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable
    one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to
    the question and obtaining thereon the required information.  In the words
    of the Court of Appeal, that test is “what would an informed person, viewing
    the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter
    through – conclude.  Would [that informed person] think that it is more likely
    than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously,
    would not decide fairly.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    applying the test, the focus is on the individual decision maker.  As stated
    by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Bennett v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Securities Commission)</i> (1992), 69 B.C.L.R. (2d) 171

    ), “we wish to add one further observation and that is as to the target of
    a bias allegation.  Bias is an attitude in mind unique to an individual.  An
    allegation of bias must be directed against a particular individual alleged,
    because of the circumstances, to be unable to bring an impartial mind to
    bear.”  In the present case, the individuals we are concerned with are the
    members of the Commission hearing the <i>de novo</i> appeal, not Maertens,
    the track judge who testified.  </p>

    Austin argues that because Maertens was one of the track judges who originally
    ruled on the very issue the Commission Panel was now seized with <i>de novo</i>,
    a reasonable apprehension of bias was created when the Commission Panel allowed
    him to testify.  In my view, this in and of itself is not sufficient.  There
    was no suggestion that some special relationship existed between Maertens
    and the tribunal such that the tribunal might give greater weight to his
    evidence than the evidence of other witnesses.  In any event, on the facts
    of this case, Maertens’ credibility was not in issue.  His evidence was neither
    challenged nor contradicted.</p>

    Austin, however, seeks to make a distinction between testimony concerning
    a track judge’s direct involvement in the investigation of the incident,
    and testimony respecting the track judge’s role as an adjudicator.  On the
    basis of this distinction, Maertens’
    evidence respecting his exchanges with the investigator on the day of the
    incident may be proper but not his evidence concerning what occurred at the
    hearing which is the subject of the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if such a distinction were appropriate, it immediately becomes obvious that
    the concern is not the fact that the track judge was allowed to testify,
    but the correctness of the Commission Panel’s ruling concerning the breadth
    of the testimony to be given.  It is the ruling, therefore, that needs to
    be examined.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Divisional Court reasoned that because Maertens provided full reasons there
    was no basis for the Commission Panel’s ruling which allowed Maertens’ to
    testify.  The
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court concluded that by ruling that Maertens could testify, the
    Commission Panel created a reasonable apprehension of bias.  With respect,
    I disagree.  First, the December 20, 2004, letter written by Maertens did
    not constitute reasons in the traditional sense.  Although it provided an
    explanation of why the track judges concluded that Austin breached the rules
    and it set out the reasons for selecting the penalty imposed, the letter
    also outlined the sequence of events starting on the day of the alleged breach
    and ending with the hearing itself.  It set out the involvement of the track
    judges and related some of the statements given by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Austin both in the course of the investigation and at the December 9 hearing.  Second,
    absent Maertens testifying at the <i>de novo</i> hearing, the factual information
    contained in this letter would be hearsay that could not be cross-examined
    upon and may well have been given limited weight by the Commission Panel.  Because
    the Commission Panel was hearing the case <i>de novo</i>, the “findings of
    fact”
    made by the track judges did not carry the same legal significance that findings
    of fact normally carry in appeals.  Finally, because there was no transcript
    of the proceedings before the track judges, one of the track judges would
    have to testify as to admissions made by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Austin in that proceeding.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Maertens
    had relevant evidence to give.  If the tribunal erred and allowed him to
    give evidence which was irrelevant and not probative, such an error may be
    reviewable on some basis.  It would not, absent more, give rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.</p>

    Commission Panel’s ruling could give rise to an apprehension of bias if,
    for example, it disclosed the existence of some preconceived views as to
    the merits or indicated that the track judge’s evidence was to be given greater
    weight.  In my view, however, the Commission Panel’s ruling gives rise to
    no such concerns.  It did not reveal any preconceived view and, given that
    the track judge’s credibility was not put into issue, there could be no concern
    regarding the weight that it would be given.</p>

    to restrict him to those areas.

    Austin’s concern that Maertens is, to some extent, in a conflict of interest.  By

    justify both the decision made and the penalty imposed by the panel of track
    judges.  This, however, would be obvious to the Commission Panel hearing
    the <i>de novo</i> appeal.  The track judges’ views were contained in Maertens’ December
    20, 2004, letter to the supervisor of Standardbred Racing explaining the
    reasons for the track judges’ decision.  The Commission Panel would expect
    Maertens to stand behind and seek to justify that decision.  All of this
    would have been taken into account by the Commission Panel when assessing
    Maertens’ evidence.  It does not provide a realistic basis for concluding
