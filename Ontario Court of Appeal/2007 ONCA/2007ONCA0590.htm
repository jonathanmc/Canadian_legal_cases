      jurisdiction is entirely statutory:  <i>R. v. Meltzer</i> (1989), 49 C.C.C.
      (3d) 453 at 460 (S.C.C.).  The Crown purports to appeal the order of Schneider
      J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, contending that his order is a “judgment” issued
      on the return of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and is, therefore, appealable
      by the Crown pursuant to s. 784(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
      1985, c. C-46.  Counsel for the respondent, Rosete, and counsel for the

      was charged with assaulting and threatening his wife.  He appeared before
      Schneider J. on April 10, 2006.  Counsel who spoke to the matter for Rosete
      indicated that Rosete had a history of mental disorder, but she did not
      believe his mental health was an issue in the proceedings on April 10.  Counsel
      advised Schneider J. that a bail hearing would be necessary.  Rosete’s
      matter was held down so that his Legal Aid status could be resolved.  </span></p>

      was brought back before Schneider J. later that day.  He had retained counsel
      through Legal Aid.  Rosete had also seen a doctor in the cells between
      his first and second appearance before Schneider J. on April 10.  Rosete’s
      new counsel advised the court that the doctor recommended a thirty day
      mental health assessment pursuant to s. 672.11(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>

      counsel asked that the order direct that the assessment be conducted forthwith.  Schneider
      J. initially seemed hesitant to make that order observing that such assessments
      had been taking three weeks to a month, presumably because of a shortage
      of beds at CAMH.  Rosete’s counsel replied: “Not if you do a <i>habeas
      corpus</i> right away.” Schneider J. then ordered:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>[</span><span style='color:black'>G]iven
      what the doctor has said, and what Mr. Hynes [counsel for the respondent]
      has indicated, I’ll order that Mr. Rosete be assessed by CAMH, or their
      designate, for a period of time not to exceed 30 days and that he be delivered
      not later than the 11th day of April [the next day]….</span></p>

      as counsel had anticipated, Rosete was not transferred from the jail to
      CAMH on April 11, counsel brought a <i>habeas corpus</i> application in
      the Superior Court of Justice for Ontario claiming that Rosete was being
      unlawfully held in the Toronto Jail because he was subject to a judicial
      order directing that he be delivered to CAMH by April 11 for a thirty day
      assessment.  Counsel sought the immediate release of the respondent.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      application came on for hearing before Nordheimer J. on April 13, 2006.  After
      hearing submissions from all counsel, during which Nordheimer J. expressed
      concern about the authorities’ failure to comply with the order of Schneider
      J., Nordheimer J. concluded that he should exercise his discretion under
      s. 775 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and remit the matter to Schneider J.  Nordheimer
      J. opined that the real question was not whether Rosete should be in or
      out of custody, but whether he should be detained in a secure hospital
      facility or in a jail.  His endorsement reads:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='color:black'>Transferred to Justice
      Schneider in 102 court on Tuesday, April 18/06 pursuant to s. 775 of the <i>Criminal

      keeping with the order of Nordheimer J., Rosete appeared before Schneider
      J. on April 18.  The proceedings continued on April 19.  Schneider J. did
      two things in the course of this hearing.  First, based on medical testimony
      he heard on April 18, Schneider J. decided that Rosete was unfit to stand
      trial and made a treatment order under s. 672.58 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That
      order has not been appealed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
color:black;'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Second, Schneider J. purported to
      address the merits of the <i>habeas corpus</i> application on the basis
      that the order of Nordheimer J. pursuant to s. 775 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>constituted
      a delegation of the Superior Court’s <i>habeas corpus</i> powers to him.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      J. interpreted the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as requiring
      that the accused be delivered forthwith to a hospital when an assessment
      order was made.  On his interpretation, the accused could not be held in
      jail pending the availability of a bed in a secure hospital. Schneider
      J. observed:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='color:black'>To my mind all accused
      should be delivered to hospital on a forthwith basis with no “stopovers” at
      a jail along the way.</span></p>

style='color:black'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      order ultimately made by Schneider J. on April 19 reflected the two determinations
      he made.  He directed that the respondent be delivered forthwith to CAMH
      pursuant to the terms of the treatment order and he made a declaration
      that the respondent was unlawfully detained in jail after April 11 while
      the subject of the assessment order he made on April 10 directing that
      the respondent be delivered to CAMH.  </span></p>

style='color:black'>Habeas corpus</span></i><span style='color:black'> is a prerogative
      writ used by the superior court to inquire into the lawfulness of the applicant’s
      detention.  Like all prerogative writs, <i>habeas corpus</i> is an expression
      of the superior court’s supervisory powers over other courts, tribunals
      and, in some cases, the executive.  Courts other than superior courts do
      not have <i>habeas corpus</i> powers.  The Superior Court of Justice for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario is a superior court.  The Ontario Court of Justice is not a superior
    court.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span
style='color:black'>Habeas corpus</span></i><span style='color:black'> applications
      have traditionally involved a two-stage process.  At the first stage, the
      detained person seeks an order from the superior court directing that the
      writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> be issued commanding the jailer to bring the
      detained person before the superior court.  At the second stage, conducted
      upon the return of the writ to the superior court with the detained person,
      the superior court inquires into the lawfulness of the detention:  see
      Patrick Hartt, “<i>Habeas Corpus</i> and <i>Certiorari</i> in Criminal
      Cases” in <i>Remedies: Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada
      1961 </i>(Toronto: Richard de Boo Ltd., 1961) 313 at 319-320;  <i>R. v.
      Olson</i> (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 491 (S.C.C.).  On the return of the writ,
      the court may, instead of determining the lawfulness of the detention,
      order the applicant’s detention continued and remit the matter to the inferior
      court to take such steps as the superior court believes will best further
      the ends of justice:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 775.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      traditional two-stage <i>habeas corpus</i> process is seldom followed today.  It
      is usually agreed that the application should proceed at a single hearing
      in which the writ is taken to have been issued and the detained person
      brought before the court for a determination of the application on its
      merits:  see Brian J. Gover &amp; Victor V. Ramraj, <i>The Criminal Lawyers’ Guide
      to Extraordinary Remedies</i> (Aurora, Ontario: Canada Law Book, 2000)

    Ontario reflect the contemporary practice.  They provide that an applicant
    may request that the issuing of the writ be dispensed with and that the two

    made that request in his application.  </span></p>

      keeping with accepted practice and Rosete’s request, the proceedings before
      Nordheimer J. were treated as a hearing on the return of the writ of <i>habeas

      continued detention; he made an order under s. 775 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> instead.  </span></p>

      reasons that seem rooted in the technical limits on the use of the writ
      of error as a means of appeal, until relatively recently there was no right
      of appeal in <i>habeas corpus</i> applications brought in criminal proceedings.  Neither
      a decision refusing to issue the writ nor the decision on the return of
      the writ could be appealed by either the applicant or the Crown:  see Robert
      J. Sharpe, <i>The Law of Habeas Corpus</i>, 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
      1989) at 201-202.  The absence of any appeal and the importance of the
      liberty interest engaged on <i>habeas corpus</i> applications led to the
      practice of allowing an applicant to renew the <i>habeas corpus</i> application
      before a different superior court judge if the application was refused
      at first instance.  The absence of any right of appeal and the practice
      of going from judge to judge with the same application were criticized:  see
      Hartt, <i>supra</i>, at 318-319.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      April 1965, Parliament amended the <i>Criminal Code</i> to create rights
      of appeal in <i>habeas corpus</i> matters and to discontinue the practice
      of going from judge to judge with the same application:  <i>An Act to Amend
      the Criminal Code (Habeas Corpus)</i>, S.C. 1964-65, c. 53, s. 1.  The
      rights of appeal in the present <i>Criminal Code</i> are largely unchanged
      from those introduced in 1964 and are found in ss. 784(3)-(5).</span></p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='color:black;'>(3) Where an application

      of a court having jurisdiction therein, no application may again be made
      on the same grounds, whether to the same or to another court or judge,
      unless fresh evidence is adduced, but an appeal from that refusal shall
      lie to the court of appeal, and where on the appeal the application is
      refused a further appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada, with

      origins of s. 775 are not entirely clear:  see <i>Martin’s Criminal Code
      1955 </i>(Toronto: Cartwright &amp; Sons Ltd., 1955) at 1014.  It would
      appear that the section reflects the common law power of a superior court
      judge on a <i>habeas corpus</i> application to decline to order the discharge
      of the applicant even if the detention was illegal.  For example, if the
      detention was rendered illegal by a procedural or jurisdictional failure
      that did not touch on the actual merits of the basis upon which the applicant
      was being detained, the superior court could remit the matter to the lower
      court for a proper determination on the merits of the applicant’s claim
      that he should be released from custody:  see <i>Re Ferreira v. R. </i>(1981),

      18 C.C.C. 110 (Ont. C.A.) at 114.  Referring to s. 1120 of the 1906 <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, a predecessor section to s. 775, he observed:</span></p>

      J. was correct when he observed that the dispute before him did not address
      the ultimate question of whether Rosete should be detained on the charges
      pending his trial, but instead challenged the legality of his detention
      in jail rather than in a secure hospital after April 11.  On the material
      before Nordheimer J., which included an outline of the factual allegations
      underlying the charges against Rosete and a copy of his lengthy criminal
      record, there was a genuine issue as to whether Rosete should be released
      from custody even if his detention in jail beyond April 11 was illegal
      by virtue of the terms of the order of Schneider J. of April 10.  Rosete’s
      entitlement to bail under s. 515 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> had not been
      addressed.</span></p>

      J. recognized that both the immediate release of Rosete and the continued
      detention of Rosete in a jail in apparent contravention of a court order
      were not in the interests of the due administration of justice.  He also
      implicitly recognized that on the material before him he could not make
      an accurate assessment of the merits of Rosete’s claim that he should be
      released immediately.  Nordheimer J. decided that Rosete’s status pending
      resolution of the criminal charges brought against him could best be assessed
      by Schneider J. who was aware of the prior proceedings and could conduct
      a proper inquiry as to the merits of Rosete’s continued detention.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      situation faced by Nordheimer J. was not unlike other situations where
      superior court justices have invoked s. 775 and remitted the matter to
      the lower court for further proceedings on the merits.  For example, there
      have been cases where accused who did not receive the ninety day bail review
      hearing required by the <i>Criminal Code</i> brought a <i>habeas corpus</i> application.  Rather
      than ordering the release of the accused on the basis that continued detention
      was unlawful, the superior court remitted the matter to the lower court
      where the bail hearing required by the <i>Criminal Code</i> could be held
      and the merits of continued detention determined:  see <i>Re Ferreira</i>, <i>supra</i>;  <i>Ex
      Parte Gooden</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 161 (Ont. High Ct.).  The lower
      court’s power to conduct the bail hearing and make the appropriate order
      came from the <i>Criminal Code</i> provision and not through the delegation
      of any power from the superior court justice.  Further, any appeal from
      the bail order made by the lower court judge had to follow the appeal provisions
      referable to bail orders found in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      775 has also been invoked where jurisdictional error led to the improper
      committal for trial of an accused at the conclusion of the preliminary
      inquiry. Instead of ordering the release of the applicant, the superior
      court remitted the matter to the lower court for the proper conduct and
      completion of the preliminary inquiry:  see <i>Re Demerais v. R. </i>(1978),
      42 C.C.C. (2d) 287 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The lower court’s powers to conduct the preliminary inquiry and make
    an order at the conclusion of that inquiry came from the relevant <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions and not by way of delegation from the superior court.  Any
    challenge to the order made by the lower court at the end of a preliminary
    inquiry would have to be by way of prerogative writ and not by way of an
    appeal under s. 784(5).</span></p>

      J. directed that Rosete be brought before Schneider J.  In my view, in
      making that direction, Nordheimer J. put Rosete in a position where Schneider
      J. could address his detention by reference to the applicable provisions
      of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Those provisions included the bail provision
      in s. 515 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the mental disorder provisions
      in Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </span></p>

      hearing evidence that Rosete was unfit to stand trial, Schneider J. determined
      that he was unfit and made a treatment order under Part XX.I.  This order
      effectively resolved the question of whether Rosete should be released
      from custody.  Rosete’s right of appeal from that order was governed by
      the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> referable to appeals from orders
      respecting fitness to stand trial:  see <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 675(3).  In
      acting as he did under Part XX.I, Schneider J. was able to do what Nordheimer
      J. was not in a position to do –
    determine on the merits whether Rosete should be in custody and, if so, where
    he should be held.  </span></p>

      of the <i>Criminal Code</i> referable to the assessment order he had made
      on April 10.  Schneider J. characterized this part of his reasons as an
      exercise of the <i>habeas corpus</i> power that had been delegated to him
      by Nordheimer J.  Section 775 does not provide for the delegation of the
      powers of a superior court to a lower court.  The matter was remitted to
      Schneider J. so he could exercise his powers under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  As
      demonstrated above, those powers were ample to make a proper determination
      of Rosete’s status.  With respect, Schneider J.’s characterization of his
      power as a delegation of a superior court power was wrong.  That mischaracterization
      cannot create appellate jurisdiction.</span></p>
