  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judgment in this matrimonial litigation cannot
    stand, principally because the trial judge’s conduct during the course of
    the trial exhibited a reasonable apprehension of bias against the appellant,
    with the result that trial fairness was compromised.  We reject this argument
    for three main reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge made express credibility findings in favour of the respondent
    and against the appellant.  These findings are supported by the evidence.  In
    particular, the record indicates that, by the time of trial, the appellant
    had failed to comply with several court orders.  Further, the respondent’s
    evidence on several matters in controversy was supported by the uncontradicted
    evidence of another witness, Ms. D. Kumar.  It was open to the trial judge
    to make the findings of credibility that he made.  We see no error in his
    weighing of the evidence nor in his assessment of the reliability of the
    testimony of the parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and importantly, we have examined the comments of the trial judge attacked
    by the appellant.  In our view, in the circumstances of this trial and having
    regard to the demonstrated conduct of the parties as established by the record,
    these comments fall far short of meeting the test for reasonable apprehension
    of bias established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. R.D.S.</i>,
    [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 and related cases.  Many of the impugned comments were
    directed to the respondent wife or her counsel, rather than the appellant
    or his counsel.  Others arose during the testimony of the respondent, in
    contrast to that of the appellant.  While some of the challenged remarks
    by the trial judge may appear to reflect his frustration and concerns with
    the appellant’s conduct, neither the trial judge’s statements nor his alleged
    interruptions during the testimony of the parties support the assertion that
    he approached this trial with a closed mind or that his management of the
    trial was unfair or partisan.  This was an acrimonious law suit.  The evidence
    of the parties was conflicting and every issue appears to have been vigorously
    contested.  Viewed as a whole, the record and the trial judge’s reasons reveal
    that he did a commendable job in weighing the evidence, managing the trial
    and adjudicating on the issues in contention.  The fresh evidence tendered
    by the appellant on appeal does not detract from this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we agree with counsel for the Children’s Lawyer that the custody and access
    order crafted by the trial judge was grounded in the evidence of the specific
    needs and best interests of the children of the marriage.  We note that this
    order responded to the appellant’s request that the children be in his custody
    50 percent of the time by providing, favourably, that the appellant have
    access to the children for more than 40 percent of the time.  Overall, the
    trial judge’s disposition of custody to the respondent mother was consistent
    with the position of the Children’s Lawyer that the respondent should exercise
    final decision making in the lives of the children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to her costs of
    the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount of $8,500.00,
    inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
