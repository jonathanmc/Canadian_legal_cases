    respondent L.B. was tried by Grossman J. of the Ontario Court of Justice
    on one count of possession of a loaded restricted firearm and seven other
    gun and gun-related counts. He was acquitted on all counts, without a trial
    on the merits, as a result of a pre-trial ruling in which the trial judge
    excluded the gun from evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals from the respondent’s acquittals and if successful, seeks a
    new trial on all counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    seminal issue at trial, and now on appeal, is whether the respondent was
    detained when, in response to a question from a police officer, he denied
    ownership of a knapsack in which his school work was found, along with a
    loaded .22 calibre handgun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the law, as he perceived it, to the uncontradicted evidence of two police
    officers who testified on a <i>voir dire</i> about their involvement with
    the respondent and the circumstances leading to the discovery of the gun,
    the trial judge found that the respondent was detained prior to being questioned
    about the ownership of the knapsack. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    finding was central to the outcome of the case. It took the trial judge down
    an analytical path that required him to consider how, if at all, the police
    had breached the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights from the point at which
    he was detained to the discovery of the gun.  That analysis proved fatal
    to the Crown’s case. The trial judge found that from the point of detention
    to the finding of the gun, the police violated the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights
    in three separate ways.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he found that the police had no legal justification to detain the respondent
    and his detention was therefore arbitrary in contravention of s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    Second, he found that the police failed to inform the respondent of his right
    to counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> before questioning him about
    the ownership of the knapsack. Third, he found that the police had no lawful
    authority to search the knapsack and in doing so, they breached the respondent’s
    privacy rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge next turned to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> and made two pertinent
    findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he found that the gun would not have been discovered had the police not violated
    the respondent’s privacy rights. Second, he found that the administration
    of justice would be brought into disrepute if the Court were to turn a blind
    eye to police conduct “that breaches fundamental constitutional rights” and
    threatens “the very fabric of our society”. Accordingly, the trial judge
    excluded the gun from evidence under s. 24(2). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that the learned trial
    judge came to the wrong conclusion on the issue of detention. Regrettably,
    that error skewed his entire analysis. Had the trial judge applied the correct
    legal principles to the uncontradicted facts, he would have found that the
    respondent was not detained when he was questioned about the ownership of
    the knapsack, nor indeed, at any time prior to arrest; likewise, he would
    have found no <i>Charter</i> breaches. It follows that the gun should have
    been admitted into evidence. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set
    aside the acquittals.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 11, 2002, at approximately 2:35 p.m., Detective Constables Reimer
    and Purches were driving in an unmarked police car westbound on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Firgrove Crescent in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto. Both officers were in plainclothes.  From their car, they noticed
    a young male (later identified as F) partially seated on the railing of a
    walkway leading up to the school grounds of Westview Collegiate High School.
    As the officers drew closer, they saw F turn his head and look up towards
    the top of the stairs. At that point, they noticed a second young male (later
    identified as the respondent L.B.), seated on the school grounds, just inside
    a fence at the upper end of the walkway. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers continued westbound for a short distance and then turned around
    and took up surveillance of F, whom they could see at the bottom of the staircase.
    While parked, they observed F glancing around and looking up in the general
    direction of L.B. He appeared to be speaking to L.B.  This led the officers
    to believe that although the two young men were physically separated, they
    were in fact
    “together”. As Officer Reimer explained, their conduct aroused suspicion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        When
    we first drive by we see Mr. F seated at the lower level, which isn’t suspicious
    or any, anything. But then as we drive by I recognize him slightly, I don’t
    know where I can place him from, and he looks up to Mr. B. Now Mr. B is sort
    of – I believe he was seated. And the way it’s laid out is that Mr. F is
    on the lower level and Mr. B is on the upper level. They can’t see each other’s
    area where they’re looking but they can see each other. And then after watching
    them for a minute it appeared that they were together.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        And
    it was even more suspicious of why they weren’t together if they were together.
    They were some distance apart and it was very suspicious to me that they
    would place themselves in that sort of position. Like that’s something that
    I would do as a police officer if I was looking for somebody in that area
    with my partner. My partner would take the upper level, I’d take the lower
    level, and we’d always be able to see each other. It’s a police tactic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Purches confirmed his partner’s uneasy feeling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I remember thinking
    why were they not in school and what were they doing set up – perhaps set
    up isn’t the right word, but why were they positioned that way, connected,
    however physically separated, and was there a reason for that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    several minutes, the officers decided to speak to the two youths to find
    out what they were doing. Officer Reimer drove eastbound on Firgrove, crossed
    lanes and stopped in the northbound lane opposite to the natural flow of
    traffic. He parked the car in front of where F was seated on the railing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    officers then got out of the car. Officer Purches, who was on the passenger
    side, looked over the roof of the car at F and L.B., displayed his police
    badge and warrant card and called out “Toronto Police”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    that point, Officer Purches got a better look at L.B., who was seated at
    the top of the slope on school property. L.B. was crouched with his knees
    in the air, and he had a black bag or satchel in his right hand. L.B. stood
    up immediately and held the bag low behind his right thigh. He then crossed
    the top of the walkway, from east to west, and passed a pole attached to
    a chain-link fence, before proceeding down the stairs towards the two officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.B.’s
    actions caught the officers somewhat off&#8209;guard. While it was their
    intention to speak to both youths, L.B. walked directly up to Officer Reimer
    without being summoned or directed to do so. Officer Reimer testified in
    cross-examination about the event as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        Okay.
    Neither you nor Officer Purches, that’s your evidence, motioned for Mr. B
    to come and speak to you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
    we didn’t.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        He
    just came on his own?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Like
    I said, he caught me off guard when he came up to me. I didn’t expect to
    speak with him. I expected to speak with Mr. F. And Mr. B walked right up
    to me. Or he walked down the stairs right up to me.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        He
    walked down the stairs?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Um
    hmm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        Perhaps
    it was his intention, Officer, to just keep walking.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        He
    could have.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        And
    it’s your testimony that L.B. just comes right up to you and starts chatting
    with you, is that right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        That’s
    the way it appeared to me.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        But
    you’re the one that asks him a question initially, isn’t that right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Yeah,
    but it’s – like it’s a casual,
    “Hey, how’s it goin’?” And he, had walked up to me and stopped. He didn’t
    motion to try and get by me. He could have very well easily. Like there was
    room between us, like between myself and my partner. And he walked up to
    me and stopped. I asked him, “Hey, how’s it goin’?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        So
    he would have had to move around you to keep going?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Well,
    he was walking straight at me when he was walking at me. He wasn’t walking
    between us. He was walking straight at me.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        So
    he would have had to move around you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Absolutely.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Yeah, Mr. B
    came right down the steps to where I was. I never got the chance to go up
    to talk to Mr. F. He came down to me.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        And
    you know what Officer Purches was doing at this time? Officer Purches …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        At
    which time?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        … never
    motioned to L.B. is what you’re saying …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        … to
    come down those stairs?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        No.
    I was in front of him. I got out before him though we did come together.
    But I was ahead of him. And my initial intention was to go to Mr. F., but
    Mr. B came up to me and, very easy to deal with, I just deal with Mr. B and
    Mr. Purches – Constable Purches went to Mr. F.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:        And
    it’s your evidence that neither of you ever asked Mr. B. to come to you even
    though it was your plan to speak to both of these people?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A:        Yes,
    we were going to speak with both of them but L.B. walked up to me.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Officer Reimer, when he got out of the car, he intended to speak to F.  That
    changed when L.B. approached him.  As a result of L.B.’s actions, Officer
    Reimer struck up a casual conversation with L.B. and Officer Purches began
    a casual conversation with F.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Officer Reimer, he initially asked L.B.
    “how it was going” and L.B. responded “good”. Officer Reimer then asked what
    L.B. and F “were doing there” and L.B. replied “just hanging out”.  L.B.
    was then asked if he and F “went to the school” and L.B. replied “yes”, it
    was his first day. When asked why he was not in school, L.B. replied that
    he “had a spare”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Reimer then asked L.B. for his name and date of birth.  He intended to do
    a check on L.B. through the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). L.B.
    complied. Meanwhile, Officer Purches, who had been speaking with F, obtained
    F’s name and date of birth and passed that information along to Officer Reimer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    officers agreed that they had no cause to detain L.B. or F and that if either
    youth had chosen to walk away or stop answering questions, he could have
    done so with impunity. They also confirmed that prior to arresting L.B. and
    F, no physical contact occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving their names and dates of birth (L.B. and F were both age fifteen)
    Officer Reimer used his hand-held radio and “ran”
    their names through CPIC. While awaiting the results, he realized that F,
    who looked familiar, was someone he had dealt with three weeks earlier on
    robbery charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Reimer testified that at this point, L.B. began showing signs of nervousness: “He
    was fidgety, he was pacing, he was looking around”. In view of L.B.’s behaviour,
    Officer Reimer had safety concerns and he wanted to prevent L.B. and F from
    communicating with each other. He did so by interrupting their conversations
    verbally “with more [of his own] casual conversation”.</p>

    found it “on the grass with some litter”. As he did so, he called down to
    L.B. and F, who were “at the bottom with Detective Constable Reimer”, and
    asked “whose bag is this”. F did not respond; L.B. replied “I don’t know”.
    In view of L.B.’s response and the fact that he had distanced himself physically
    from the bag, Officer Purches treated the bag as abandoned property and he
    opened it. Inside, he located school work with L.B.’s name on it; he also
    discovered a loaded .22 calibre handgun. At that point he shouted “gun, gun,
    gun” and he and his partner arrested L.B. and F at gunpoint.</p>

    finding of detention could be based: (1) physical constraint; (2) control
    over the movement of a person by a demand or direction which may have significant
    legal consequences and which prevents or impedes access to counsel; and (3)
    situations where the person concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation

    76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.)], the cases appear to indicate: 1) that there
    can be a range of detentions including a ‘brief detention’ for the purpose
    of identification, 2) <i>that compulsion to respond to questions posed by
    a police officer can be presumed, unless there is evidence indicating informed
    consent, and 3) that consideration of whether the police had ‘articulable
    cause’ or other authority to stop someone in the first place is fundamental
    to the legality of the entire encounter. Where there is no ‘articulable cause,’ the
    court can find that there was a detention and an illegal search without the
    need for any testimony by the accused as to his subjective perception of
    a sense of compulsion, and without</i> <i>considering the specific factors

    will be said about <i>Mellenthin</i> in due course. For now, it will be recalled
    that in that case, a police officer directed Mellenthin to pull his vehicle
    over as part of a random spot check. In response to various questions posed
    by the officer, Mellenthin opened his gym bag and eventually produced a plastic
    bag that contained glass vials. The officer then searched the bag from which
    the vials were produced and found cannabis resin.</p>

    the context of determining whether the police had violated Mellenthin’s privacy
    rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, Cory J. at p. 487 made the following
    observation which the trial judge in <i>Powell</i> interpreted as representing
    a shift in the law of detention insofar as s. 8 and s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i> were
    concerned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>It has been
      seen that as a result of the check stop the appellant was detained. The
      arbitrary detention was imposed as soon as he was pulled over</i>.  As
      a result of that detention, it can reasonably be inferred that the appellant
      felt compelled to respond to questions put to him by the police officer.
      In those circumstances it is incumbent upon the Crown to adduce evidence
      that the person <i>detained</i> had indeed made an informed consent to
      the search based on his awareness of his rights to refuse to respond to
      questions or to consent to the search. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in the instant case agreed with the reasoning in <i>Powell</i> and
    found that Cory J.’s analysis in <i>Mellenthin </i>applied to the random
    stopping of pedestrians. In short, if motorists who were pulled over randomly
    could be presumed to feel compelled to respond to questions put to them by
    the police, so too could pedestrians. </p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    the trial judge adopted the reasoning in <i>Powell </i>as to the importance
    of
    “articulable cause” and the implications flowing from its absence for detention
    purposes.  On the evidence before him, the trial judge quite properly found
    that Officers Reimer and Purches had no authority to detain the respondent,
    even temporarily. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the trial judge, the fact that the police had no authority to detain the
    respondent was of “fundamental importance” in determining the issue of psychological
    detention. In that regard, he quoted with approval the proposition from <i>Powell</i> that
    absent lawful authority to detain, the court could “find that there was a
    detention and an illegal search without the need for any testimony by the
    accused as to his subjective perception of a sense of compulsion, and without
    considering the specific factors set out in the <i>Moran</i> test”. </p>

    sum, as indicated, the trial judge adopted and applied the legal framework
    formulated by the trial judge in <i>Powell</i> in determining whether L.B.
    was psychologically detained.  L.B. was a pedestrian whom the police questioned
    in circumstances where they had no right to detain him, even temporarily.
    Hence, in deciding the issue of psychological detention, L.B. could be presumed
    to feel compelled to answer the questions put to him by the police, without
    the need for testimony from him as to his subjective perception of a sense
    of compulsion. In other words, the trial judge effectively shifted the onus
    to the Crown to show that L.B. knew that he could refuse to respond to the
    questions put to him by the police and that he could walk away at any time
    with impunity.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I take into

    that they were police officers, one of whom testified he had had dealings
    with one of the males only weeks earlier, created, in my view, an atmosphere
    of some oppression and not just a casual cordial exchange of greetings.</p>

    was brought to the trial judge’s attention. Unfortunately, he declined to

    At 1:20 a.m., two officers in a police car observed H walking on the sidewalk
    with his friends, one of whom was carrying a bottle of beer. Through the
    open window, one of the officers said words to the effect of: “Hi, how’s
    it going? Where are you guys headed?” At that point, H and his friends came
    over to the car, without being asked to do so, and spoke to the officers.
    They responded to various questions, including their names, dates of birth,
    and phone numbers. One of the officers testified that this type of procedure
    was done as a matter of routine. He further stated that he and his partner
    had no reason to suspect that H or his friends had committed an offence.</p>

    the conversation with H and his friends continued, one of the officers conducted

    her reasons, at paras. 27 to 30, Steel J.A. observed that no simple test
    can be applied in determining whether a psychological detention has occurred
    and that the inquiry in each case must be fact-specific. At para. 33 however,
    she rejected the notion that in police-citizen encounters, a request for
    identification will necessarily create an inference that the citizen “reasonably
    believed that he had no other choice but to comply” and that “at that point … the
    onus shift[s] onto the Crown to prove informed consent”. Rather, as she observed
    at para. 36: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We have not
    yet reached a situation where a compulsion to comply will be inferred simply
    because the request comes from a police officer or that a compulsion to respond

    two decisions of this court – <i>R. v. Grafe</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 267
    and <i>R. v. Hall</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 289 – both of which remain good
    law.  Further support is found in <i>R. v. Rajaratnam</i>, [2006] A.J. No.&nbsp;1373

    ‘detain’, within the meaning of ss. 9 and 10 of the <i>Charter</i>, every
    suspect they stop for purposes of identification, or even interview.” Accordingly,
    not every conversation with the police is a detention. There must be something
    more: a deprivation of liberty. The law has not yet reached a point that
    a compulsion to comply will be inferred whenever a police officer requests
    information, for that would mean police could never ask questions: <i>R.

    J.A. considered the <i>Mellenthin</i> analogy and found it to be misplaced.
    At paras. 56 to 59, she made the following observations, with which I completely
    agree:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I disagree [with
    Lane J.’s understanding of <i>Mellenthin</i>]. The same approach does not
    apply to the stopping of motor vehicles as it does to the questioning of
    pedestrians. In the cases involving the random stopping of motor vehicles,
    the courts have found a detention to exist, as the term was defined in <i>Therens</i>.
    The issue in the motor vehicle cases was whether the detention was arbitrary
    and, if so, whether the violation was justifiable under s. 1 or otherwise
    authorized by law. See <i>R. v. Ladouceur</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257 at 1278,
    56 C.C.C. (3d) 22. In particular, in <i>Mellenthin</i>, the compulsion to
    speak arose from the fact that a motorist was deemed to be detained as soon
    as he was stopped in a motor vehicle. It is at that point that the police
    assume control over the movements of the motorist under threat of criminal
    sanction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>It has been
    seen that as a result of the check stop the appellant was detained. The arbitrary
    detention was imposed as soon as he was pulled over. As a result of that
    detention, it can reasonably be inferred that the appellant felt compelled
    to respond to questions put to him by the police officer. [<i>Mellenthin</i>,
    at p. 624, per Cory J.] …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Consequently, <i>Mellenthin</i> and
    the other motor vehicle cases are not an appropriate analogy when determining
    whether a detention has occurred in a pedestrian-stopping case. In speaking
    to an individual on the sidewalk, a police officer does not obviously assume
    control over the movements of an individual in the same way as stopping the
    driver of a motor vehicle. More importantly, on the sidewalk, unless there
    is evidence to the contrary, as required by <i>Therens</i>, there is no compulsion
    to speak and one can walk away.</p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), upon which the accused also relies, is distinguishable from this case.
    It is yet another motor vehicle case and the detention flowed from that initial
    fact. At p. 488:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellant
    was clearly detained when the motor vehicle in which he was riding was pulled
    over by constable [sic] Wilkin …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:
left'>And at p. 489:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>This detention
    was a direct result of the stopping of a motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Again, the issue
    in that case was not whether the accused was detained, but rather whether
    the detention was arbitrary. It is an important distinction. So long as police
    officers merely question citizens and do not interfere with individual liberties
    by detaining them, such proactive policing should not be prohibited.</p>

line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed, the trial judge in the instant case also found, in line with <i>Powell</i>,
    that a lack of “articulable cause” is of fundamental importance in assessing
    the issue of psychological detention. In that regard, he agreed with <i>Powell</i> that
    absent lawful authority to detain, the court could
    “find that there was a detention and an illegal search without the need for
    any testimony by the accused as to his subjective perception of a sense of
    compulsion, and without considering the specific factors set out in the <i>Moran</i> test”.
    With respect, that too is an incorrect statement of law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Post-<i>Mann</i>,
    the term “articulable cause” is no longer used; it is now referred to as
    “reasonable grounds to detain”. <i>Mann</i> teaches that where reasonable
    grounds to detain exist, the police may lawfully detain a person for a brief
    period of time. In other words, limited detention is lawful. But <i>Mann</i> and
    its progeny do not assist in determining the threshold issue, namely, whether
    a person has been detained in the first place.  The fact that the police
    may have reasonable grounds to detain someone does not mean that detention
    will automatically occur when the police approach and start talking to that
    person; the same holds true when the police do not have reasonable grounds
    to detain. To repeat, we have not yet reached the point that compulsion to
    comply will be inferred whenever a police officer requests information. That
    was made clear by Iacobucci J. in <i>R.&nbsp;v. Mann, supra</i>, at para.
    19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>‘Detention’ has
    been held to cover, in Canada, a broad range of encounters between police
    officers and members of the public. <i>Even so, the police cannot be said
    to ‘detain’, within the meaning of ss. 9 and 10 of the Charter, every suspect
    they stop for purposes of identification, or even interview. The person who
    is stopped will in all cases be ‘detained’ in the sense of ‘delayed’, or ‘kept
    waiting’. But the constitutional rights recognized by ss. 9 and 10 of the
    Charter are not engaged by delays that involve no significant physical or
    psychological restraint</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the view expressed by the trial judge, while reasonable grounds to detain
    may bear on the nature of the detention, their absence is not of “fundamental
    importance” in deciding whether detention has occurred in the first place. </p>

    so concluding, I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that the motivation
    of the police for approaching and speaking to citizens is irrelevant to the
    issue of psychological compulsion. In <i>H. (C.R.)</i> at paras. 49 and 67,
    Steel J.A. found that “purpose and motive” were relevant factors and she
    cites as examples situations of racial profiling, harassment and other improper
    purposes. </p>

    respondent bore the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities,
    that he was psychologically detained. His failure to testify did not help
    his cause. It left the issue to be decided solely on the uncontradicted evidence
    of Officers Reimer and Purches. Far from assisting him, their evidence belied
    his position. </p>

    to the officers, they did not demand anything of the respondent, nor did
    they direct him to do anything. On the contrary, it was the respondent who
    cast aside the black bag and, without prompting, walked down the stairs and
    approached the officers. He did so of his own volition. His conduct actually
    caught the officers off-guard, and in my view, it speaks volumes against
    his position that he was psychologically detained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s conduct in approaching the officers hardly fits the image of
    a frightened youth who felt psychologically compelled to submit to the police
    in deprivation of his liberty. On the contrary, it speaks to a street-wise
    teenager who quickly sized up the situation and determined that his best
    defence in the circumstances was a strong offence. Put simply, this was not
    a case of psychological compulsion exerted by the police; it was a case of
    psychological control attempted by the respondent.</p>

    when the respondent realized that his ploy was not working, he began to panic.
    That explains his nervous behaviour when Officer Purches walked up the stairs
    and began to search for the black knapsack. Here, the words of MacDonnell
    J. in <i>R. v. Orellana</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 5746 (O.C.J.) at para. 29 are
    apposite: “…the source of his [Orellana’s] fear was not anything the officer
    did or said but rather the fact that he was in possession of crack cocaine”.
    Substitute “.22 calibre unregistered handgun” for “crack cocaine” and the
    analogy is exact. At the very least, the evidence is as consistent with that
    scenario (fear of being caught) as it is with the scenario urged by the respondent
    (feeling compelled to respond to the police).</p>

    do not suggest that the respondent did not feel some stress in the situation.
    No doubt, he felt somewhat intimidated by the police given the obvious power
    imbalance that existed. He may also have felt some anxiety by reason of the
    positioning of the police car, the fact that both officers got out of the
    car and the manner in which Officer Reimer attempted to prevent him and F
    from communicating with each other. The trial judge quite properly took those
    factors into account in assessing the issue of detention. But respectfully,
    he went wrong on the legal test. In my view, had he applied the correct legal
    test to the uncontradicted evidence of the officers and placed the onus on
    the respondent, where it belonged, he would have found that psychological
    compulsion had not been made out, at least not on a balance of probabilities.
    In the circumstances, evidence from the respondent was a virtual must, and
    it was not forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing whether the respondent was detained, the trial judge took into
    account other factors that in my respectful view, he should not have. Specifically,
    I do not consider it relevant that one of the officers “had had dealings
    with one of the males [F] only weeks earlier”. F’s detention was not in issue
    and nothing in the record indicates that L.B. was even aware of F’s prior
    difficulties with the police. </p>

line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I consider it relevant that the police “drove by and returned to question
    the accused”, rather than simply “driv[ing] up and stop[ping]”. With respect,
    I am not at all sure that I understand the difference. Regardless, there
    is no evidence that L.B. saw the police drive by and no evidence that this
    had any impact on him if he did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I fail to see how “the running of CPIC checks”
    was significant in the circumstances of this case. L.B. did not testify and
    there is no evidence he knew that Officer Reimer was doing a CPIC check on
    him when he used his hand-held radio, or if he did, that it had any impact
    on him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    sum, when the proper legal principles are applied to the uncontradicted evidence
    of Officers Reimer and Purches, absent evidence from L.B. to the contrary,
    there is virtually nothing to substantiate a finding of psychological detention.
    With respect, the trial judge erred in concluding otherwise.</p>

    and Officer Purches was entitled to rely on it as a basis for searching the
    bag in the belief that it had been abandoned either by the respondent or
    someone else.</p>

    this point, the trial judge found that it was unreasonable for Officer Purches
    to “assume or conclude that the bag was abandoned having seen it in L.B.’s
    possession brief moments earlier”. In so concluding, the trial judge referred
    to the basis of Officer Purches’s belief, namely, L.B.’s denial of ownership,
    but he refused to consider L.B.’s response in assessing the officer’s explanation
    because in his view, the response was inadmissible.</p>

    was inadmissible. Had he considered it, I am satisfied that he would have
    accepted Officer Purches’s evidence and found that the search of the bag
    was legally justified in the circumstances. Having disclaimed any privacy
    interest in the bag, the respondent effectively precluded himself from relying
    on s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> to impugn the lawfulness of Officer Purches’s
    search. </p>
