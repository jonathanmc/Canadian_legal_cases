  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>A.        </span>INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ghassan
    Ijam pleaded guilty to three criminal offences &#8213; possession of the
    proceeds of crime, possession of the instruments of forgery, and production
    of counterfeit money.  He was sentenced by McMahon&nbsp;J. to a term of imprisonment
    of twenty&#8209;one months to be followed by two years probation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals his sentence on two grounds &#8213; the sentencing judge
    erred by not imposing a conditional sentence, and the sentencing judge erred
    by failing to consider the appellant’s strict bail conditions when determining
    the type and quantum of his sentence.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>B.        </span>FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 2004, the appellant and his co&#8209;accused set up a counterfeit
    operation in a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto apartment.  The operation was sophisticated and had the potential
    to produce high quality counterfeit bills and marks.  When the appellant
    and his co&#8209;accused were arrested on February&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2004, the
    operation had already produced approximately $8000 in counterfeit money,
    but they had not distributed any of the fake funds.  The police seized the
    counterfeit money and $2980 of real money.  The appellant admitted that $1000
    of the real money was a deposit on future counterfeiting, which formed the
    basis of his guilty plea for possession of the proceeds of crime.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was released on bail pending his trial.  He spent almost five weeks
    under house arrest with exceptions for school or while in the company of
    his surety.  The next eleven months were spent with a 10:00 p.m. curfew,
    except while in the company of his surety.  For the final nineteen months,
    the curfew remained, but included an exception for work purposes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge wrote careful and extensive reasons for sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge identified eight mitigating factors that favoured the appellant &#8213; his
    guilty plea and remorse, the absence of a prior criminal record, the appellant’s
    youth (age 22 at the time of sentencing), his employment, his enrolment at
    Ryerson University, a positive pre&#8209;sentence report, strong character
    letters from his employers, co&#8209;workers and family members, and the
    support of his family, especially his father and mother.  The sentencing
    judge concluded his list of mitigating factors with this statement: “His
    father was an impressive witness and I accept that the accused has turned
    his life around since this incident.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge also considered several aggravating factors &#8213; the
    nature of the offences, the sophistication and planning of the operation,
    the large scale of the operation, and the high quality of the counterfeit
    bills.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge then turned to a balancing of the mitigating and aggravating
    factors.  He said: “This is not an easy case, balancing the interests of
    the accused, individual and general deterrence.”  He rejected a penitentiary
    sentence because of “the young age of the accused, the excellent steps he
    has taken to get his life on track, his plea of guilty and family support,
    and he has no criminal record.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge also concluded that a conditional sentence was not appropriate
    in this case.  He reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have carefully considered whether a conditional
    sentence would appropriately, in this case, address the issue of general
    deterrence and individual deterrence.  It certainly would be in the interest
    of the accused particularly for the steps he has taken to be granted a conditional
    sentence.  I must conclude, however, that general deterrence cannot be met
    in this case by a conditional sentence.  A message must be sent by the court
    loud and clear that if you are going to set up a sophisticated counterfeiting
    operation to counterfeit our national currency you will go to jail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge concluded that “a fair and just sentence is a sentence of
    21 months incarceration to be followed by two years probation.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the appellant seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence.  The fresh
    evidence is in the form of an affidavit from the appellant, with attached
    exhibits.  Generally, the affidavit provides information about the appellant’s
    activities since he received bail pending appeal, namely, that he has continued
    his employment and his studies.  Further, he has sponsored a child through
    World Vision.  The affidavit also states that the appellant has complied
    with his bail conditions and that he would be willing to speak at schools
    and community organizations about his experiences with the criminal justice
    system.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>C.        </span>ISSUES</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two issues on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>(1)       Did the trial judge err by not imposing a conditional sentence?</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>(2)       Did the trial judge err by failing to consider the appellant’s strict
    bail conditions when determining the type and quantum of sentence?</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>D.        </span>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is a sentence appeal.  My review of the sentence imposed by the sentencing
    judge must be anchored in the knowledge that the Supreme Court of Canada
    has strongly cautioned appellate courts to show substantial deference to
    the sentences imposed by trial judges: see <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995),
    102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).  This deference applies to a judge’s decision
    whether or not to impose a conditional sentence: see <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000),
    140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).  Appellate interference with a sentence is
    warranted only if the sentencing judge has committed an error in principle,
    failed to consider or overemphasized a relevant factor, or if the sentence
    is demonstrably unfit: see <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d)
    327 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(1)       </span>Incarceration <i>versus</i> conditional
    sentence</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the sentencing judge failed to consider his youth
    and lack of a criminal record when considering the option of a conditional
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The sentencing judge’s reasons are not sparse or lean.  They are
    fully developed, with careful attention to a dozen mitigating and aggravating
    factors.  Two of these factors, explicitly, were the appellant’s youth and
    the absence of a prior criminal record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is true that the sentencing judge specifically mentioned these two factors
    as reasons for rejecting the Crown’s position that the appropriate sentence
    was a penitentiary term.  However, specific consideration in this context
    does not mean that the sentencing judge ignored these same two factors when
    considering whether a conditional sentence was appropriate.  On the contrary,
    a fair reading of the sentencing judge’s reasons demonstrates that he considered <i>all</i> the
    mitigating and aggravating factors in the context of the three options he
    was considering, namely, conditional sentence, incarceration in a reformatory,
    and incarceration in a penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also contends that the sentencing judge overemphasized the aggravating
    factors without explaining why they led him to reject a conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The sentencing judge’s description of the aggravating factors,
    all of which related to the nature and scope of the crimes, amply supported
    his decision to impose a custodial sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    recent years, this court has treated commercial crimes very seriously.  Generally,
    sentences for these crimes should be custodial, not conditional: see, for
    example, <i>R. v. Holub</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 166; <i>R. v. Dobis</i> (2002),
    163 C.C.C. (3d) 259; and <i>R. v. Bogart</i> (2002), 167 C.C.C. (3d) 390.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the sentencing judge described the nature of the principal offence
    and its consequences in compelling fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Counterfeiting is a crime that strikes at the heart
    of commercial confidence in our Canadian currency.  One need not go farther
    that the local coffee shop to see the little signs indicating the store does
    not accept certain denominations of Canadian currency due to fear of counterfeit
    bills.  Counterfeiting not only victimizes the public confidence in our Canadian
    currency, it also victimizes the cab driver, the shopkeeper or the large
    commercial bank.  As soon as the counterfeit bill goes into circulation,
    it is only a matter of time until someone else will be stuck with the loss
    when the counterfeit is finally discovered.  Often innocent members of the
    community have to try to explain to the police how they ended up in possession
    of counterfeit money and tried honestly to use it at the local grocery store.  Counterfeiting
    is simply a crime driven by dishonesty and greed that impacts on all Canadians.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge also noted that the number of counterfeit Canadian currency
    notes had increased by 1800&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent between 1992 and 2005, which “clearly
    demonstrates counterfeiting of Canadian currency is something that is on
    the rise and is something that has had a negative impact on the community.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellant’s considerable efforts to achieve rehabilitation
    are to be commended.  There is no doubt that his many redeeming qualities
    made a conditional sentence an attractive option.  But this fact was not
    lost on the sentencing judge, who, as I have said, carefully considered all
    the relevant factors.  I cannot say that the sentencing judge’s rejection
    of a conditional sentence for this offender constituted any of the categories
    of error summarized in <i>M. (C.A.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Accordingly, there
    is no basis for appellate intervention with the sentencing judge’s decision
    on this ground.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(2)       </span>Strict
    pre&#8209;trial bail</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing
    to consider the appellant’s stringent pre&#8209;trial bail conditions as
    a mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    set out above, the appellant spent about thirty&#8209;one months on bail
    before his trial.  The appellant experienced three bail regimes &#8213;
    an initial five week period under house arrest with exceptions for school
    or while in the company of his surety, an eleven month period under a 10:00
    p.m. curfew except while in the company of his surety, and a final nineteen
    month period under the same curfew but with an additional exception for work
    purposes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel raised the issue of pre&#8209;trial bail in her sentencing submissions:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So, your honour can take into consideration restrictive
    bail conditions.  So, we have a situation where I don’t think that it could
    be said - - I think that there’s a history of compliance here.  History of
    compliance with bail and with an extremely restrictive bail.  So, essentially,
    your honour can treat that as a form of pretrial custody in whatever formula
    your honour wishes to do, and the Court of Appeal has endorsed that approach
    especially when you have house arrest.  Now, the house arrest has allowed
    him to work, but that’s what we want.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge identified and discussed comprehensively eight mitigating
    and four aggravating factors before imposing sentence.  He did not mention
    pre&#8209;trial bail as a mitigating factor.  The appellant submits that
    this constitutes an error in principle because this court said in <i>R. v.
    Downes</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 488 at para.&nbsp;33, that “time spent
    under stringent bail conditions, especially under house arrest, must be taken
    into account as a relevant mitigating circumstance.…  [I]t is incumbent on
    the sentencing judge to explain why he or she has decided not to take pre&#8209;sentence
    house arrest into account.”</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the fact situations in <i>Downes</i> and this case are substantially different.  In <i>Downes</i>,
    a house arrest bail regime remained in place for eighteen months; here, it
    lasted five weeks and was then replaced by a less stringent regime.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    in this case the record before the sentencing judge did not demonstrate that
    the bail conditions had prejudiced, or imposed undue hardship on, the appellant:
    see<i> Downes</i> at para.&nbsp;37.  For example, the pre&#8209;sentence
    report describes the appellant’s situation in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The subject is presently living in the familial
    home in the town of Richmond Hill.  He is single with no children and maintains
    full time employment at “End to End Networks.” When he’s not working he enjoys
    spending his leisure time with his friends on the weekends meeting at various
    coffee shops in the city.  He also mentioned that he enjoys going to Wasaga
    beach during the summer with his friends and to the parks to play soccer.  He
    describes his friends as being well&#8209;educated individuals; some are
    still in university studying while others are successfully working in their
    fields.  None are reported to have a criminal record prior to this criminal
    offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this is not a description of hardship or deprivation.  In any event,
    it is a picture of a life far different from pre&#8209;trial custody in the
    Don jail or the West Detention Centre which might have been the appellant’s
    situation if bail had been denied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    it is desirable that appellate courts not hamstring judges in their weighing
    of relevant factors in the sentencing process.  The sentencing judge in this
    case addressed twelve mitigating and aggravating factors in his reasons.  They
    were all important factors and the sentencing judge’s treatment of them was
    comprehensive and careful.  The thirteenth factor – pre-trial bail – was
    specifically drawn to his attention by counsel for the appellant and was
    the subject of submissions at the sentencing hearing.  In these circumstances,
    particularly as the period of strict pre&#8209;trial bail was very brief
    and it is apparent that this factor was of lesser significance than the others,
    it makes no sense to conclude that the sentencing judge failed to consider
    it, or to take it into account in his sentencing calculus.  The sentencing
    judge simply determined that, in the particular circumstances of this case,
    this factor was outweighed by many competing – and more powerful – considerations.  It
    was open to the sentencing judge to so conclude.  That said, it would have
    been preferable had the sentencing judge explicitly explained that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, <i>Downes</i> itself
    recognizes that the imposition of absolutes by appellate courts on sentencing
    judges is to be avoided.  In the paragraph immediately before the one relied
    on by the appellant in this appeal, Rosenberg&nbsp;J.A. cited passages from
    two appellate authorities, <i>R. v. Lau</i> (2004), 193 C.C.C. (3d) 51 at
    para. 15 (Alta. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Spencer</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 181
    at para. 43 (Ont. C.A.), where the courts stated that stringent bail conditions “may” and “can” be
    taken into account and have a mitigating effect on sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion is reinforced by the sentencing principles outlined in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  Section 719(3) of the <i>Code</i>, which
    provides that time spent in custody as a result of an offence may be taken
    into account by a sentencing judge in determining the sentence to be imposed
    on a person convicted of an offence, makes no reference to pre-trial bail.  Nor
    has the <i>Code</i> been amended to include reference to pre-trial bail,
    in a manner analogous to the treatment of “time spent in custody” under s.
    719(3).  The absence of such provisions concerning pre-trial bail reinforces
    the conclusion that pre-trial bail should not be seen as a compulsory or
    inflexible mitigation factor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    there is recent authority from this court that failure by a sentencing judge
    to refer in his or her reasons to bail conditions does not automatically
    constitute an error in principle.  In <i>R. v. Lawes</i>, 2007 ONCA 10 at
    para. 10 the court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In our view, even if the experienced trial judge
    failed to consider the appellant’s bail conditions as a mitigating factor
    in fixing sentence pursuant to <i>R. v. Downes</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d)
    488, at para. 42, his failure to do so is not fatal to the ultimate sentence
    imposed.  He was entitled to emphasize community safety and the need to continue
    to send the message of deterrence to those who threaten that safety with
    firearms.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>See also: <i>R. v. Hunjan</i>, 2007
    ONCA 102 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge engaged in similar reasoning in this case.  He emphasized
    the important points &#8213; both mitigating and aggravating &#8213; and
    did not expressly mention pre&#8209;trial bail.  As I have said, however,
    on this record, it is inconceivable that the sentencing judge failed to consider
    the implications of the appellant’s pre&#8209;trial bail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    I do not accept the proposition that bail, even with stringent conditions,
    and pre&#8209;trial custody are to be regarded as equivalents in every case.  Put
    bluntly, bail is not jail.  Bail is what an accused person desires to stay
    out of jail.  That is because, at a practical, common sense level known to
    all accused persons, the pith and substance of bail is liberty, whereas the
    essence of jail is a profound loss of liberty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    import of the above reasoning is this:  Pre&#8209;trial bail and pre&#8209;trial
    custody are very different concepts.  Their foundations are different because
    their realities for accused persons are different.  That said, there will
    be cases &#8213; <i>Downes</i>, with long&#8209;term house arrest bail conditions,
    is one &#8213; where a sentencing judge should give mitigation effect to
    pre&#8209;trial bail.  However, there will be many other cases &#8213; <i>Lawes</i> and <i>Hunjan</i> are
    examples &#8213; where this factor should attract little, if any, weight.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this appeal falls into the second category.</p>
  <h4><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(3)<span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submitted fresh evidence on the appeal, which I described earlier
    in these reasons.  In my view, the fresh evidence confirms the many redeeming
    qualities &#8213; good and supportive family, steady employment, university
    studies, community involvement &#8213; of the appellant.  The sentencing
    judge was aware of these qualities and clearly took them into account.  I
    do not think that the fresh evidence tendered on appeal, by itself, justifies
    interference with the sentence he imposed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    there is a new factor that, combined with the fresh evidence, inclines me
    to the view that at this juncture this court should provide relief from the
    custodial component of the appellant’s sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    new factor is the chronology and the events of this appeal.  The appeal was
    originally argued before a three judge panel (MacPherson, Cronk and Gillese
    JJ.A.) on April&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2007.  The panel reserved its decision.  It
    then emerged that two other appeals under reserve, <i>R. v. Panday</i> <i>and
    Yue</i> and <i>R. v. Jalota</i>, also involved the issue of whether credit
    could be given for strict bail in imposing a sentence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relationship between the issues on this appeal and the other appeals was
    brought to the attention of McMurtry C.J.O. who decided that there should
    be a rehearing of both appeals with a five-judge panel composed of the judges
    from both of the original hearings (Cronk J.A. had sat on both appeals).  The
    rehearing took place on June&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2007 and the decisions in all
    three appeals have been under reserve until today.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    consequences of this chronology for the appellant have been particularly
    unfortunate.  He and his supportive family have had several more months of
    waiting and stress, presumably there has been some additional expense associated
    with the rehearing and, of particular importance, the appellant’s studies
    at

    the events surrounding the rehearing of this appeal, coupled with the fresh

    the appellant was charged with this offence, there was a complete turnaround
    in his behaviour.  As the trial judge put it: “I accept that the accused
    has turned his life around since this incident.”  The appellant enjoys the
    full support of his family and friends.  He has earned a diploma from

    in that field.  He has shown himself to be a conscientious and dedicated
    worker.  He has the trust and confidence of his employer.  The pre-sentence
    report was very favourable.  The appellant pleaded guilty and showed remorse
    for his offence.  The fresh evidence filed before this court, in the form
    of an affidavit from the appellant, confirms that he has continued on this
    very positive trajectory since he was sentenced.  He works forty hours a
    week as lead network analyst for his employer.  He is pursuing further studies

    is clear that a custodial term of imprisonment is not required for the purpose

    not pose a risk of re-offending and it is not necessary to imprison him in
    order to protect society.  Given the appellant’s continuing progress, rehabilitation
    would be hindered rather than fostered by a custodial sentence.  </span>As
    the trial judge himself recognized, the only purpose a custodial term of
    imprisonment could possibly serve is general deterrence.  The issue for me
    is whether the trial judge’s decision that general deterrence made it necessary

    is well established by the case law that when sentencing a youthful first

    a sentencing judge should not place undue weight on general deterrence.  This

    commercial crimes (thirteen counts of obtaining property by false pretences).  Writing
    for the court, Martin J.A. stated at 377:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>In our view, before imposing a custodial
      sentence upon a first offender the sentencing Court should explore the
      other dispositions which are open to him and only impose a custodial sentence

      no other sentence is appropriate.  In our view, this offence does not fall

      v. Priest</i>, <i>supra</i>, the trial judge sentenced a youthful first
      offender to a custodial term on the ground that a custodial term was required
      for the purpose of general deterrence in light of the prevalence of the
      offence of break and enter in the community.  Rosenberg J.A. held, at 294-295,
      that the trial judge had erred by over-emphasizing general deterrence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>The primary objectives in sentencing

      followed by a term of probation.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Citing <i>R. v. Stein, supra</i>,
    Rosenberg J.A. added:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>[I]t has been an important principle
      of sentencing in this province that the sentence should constitute the
      minimum necessary intervention that is adequate in the particular circumstances.  This
      principle implies that trial judges consider community-based dispositions
      first and impose more serious forms of punishment only when necessary.  These
      principles have now been codified in the recently proclaimed sections 718
      and 718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Section 718(c) instructs that separation
      of offenders from society is an appropriate objective of sentencing “where
      necessary”. Section 718.2(d) directs that an offender should not be deprived

    principle pertinent to this case is that even when there are aggravating
    factors which might point to the need for a sentence geared to general deterrence, “a
    conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence”,
    and it is an error “to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence <i><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>ab
    initio</span></i><span lang=EN style='color:black;'> simply because aggravating
    features are present”: <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.)

    the trial judge at his word, he refused to give a conditional sentence because,
    for him, the predominant consideration was that “[a] message must be sent
    by the court loud and clear that if you are going to set up a sophisticated
    counterfeiting operation to counterfeit our national currency you will go
    to jail.” </p>

    my respectful view, the governing case law holds that a conditional sentence
    can serve the purposes of general deterrence and that the trial judge’s intended
    deterrence message ordinarily should not be sent when the cost is imprisoning
    a youthful first offender where all other factors strongly point to a conditional
    sentence. </p>

      of the conditions, the onus is on the offender to establish those facts

    appellant was arguably under strict bail conditions for five weeks, but thereafter
    the terms changed and he was under a considerably less strict regime.  He
    offered no “information as to the impact of the conditions”.  I agree with
    paras. 28 to 30 of the reasons of MacPherson J.A. that, given the brevity
    of the period under which the conditions were arguably strict and the absence
    of evidence of any significant hardship or deprivation, this case is readily
    distinguishable from <i>Downes</i>.</p>

    do not agree with the implication at paras. 31-32 of MacPherson J.A.’s reasons
    that appellate courts “hamstring” trial judges by requiring them to give
    reasons for rejecting relevant factors in the sentencing process.  Appellate
    courts owe sentencing judges deference, but sentencing judges owe those being
    sentenced a reasoned explanation for the sentence that is imposed.  That
    is the condition upon which deference is owed and where the reasons fall
    short, appellate courts have a duty to intervene.  In my view, the trial
    judge should have dealt with the appellant’s strict bail conditions argument
    in his reasons for sentence, if only to explain that the appellant failed
    to bring himself within the <i>Downes </i>principle.  However, where as in
    this case, the <i>Downes</i> criteria are not satisfied, or as in <i>R. v.
    Lawes</i> 2007 ONCA 102 and <i>R. v. Hunjan</i> 2007 ONCA 102, where consideration
    of strict bail does not affect the fitness of the sentence imposed, there
    is no basis for this court to alter the sentence imposed. </p>
