  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>A.        </span>INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are several provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i> that impose minimum sentences
    for the commission of certain criminal offences.  One such provision is s.&nbsp;346(1.1),
    which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>346(1.1)         Every person who commits extortion
    is guilty of an indictable offence and liable</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)       where a firearm is used in the commission
    of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a <i>minimum punishment of
    imprisonment</i> for a term of four years….                                             [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is not unusual in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    for a person charged with a criminal offence, including a serious offence
    involving a firearm, to be granted bail pending his or her trial.  This follows
    naturally from the presumption of innocence and s.&nbsp;11(e) of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, which provides that any person charged
    with an offence has the right “not to be denied bail without just cause.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sometimes
    conditions attached to the bail order impose serious restraints on the liberty
    of an accused person.  The issue on these appeals is whether a period of
    strict pre&#8209;trial bail can be regarded as a “punishment of imprisonment” in
    the context of statutory minimum sentences so as to reduce the sentence below
    the statutory minimum if credit is given for pre&#8209;trial bail.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>B.        </span>FACTS</h4>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>            (1)       </span>The
    parties and the crimes</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties are agreed with respect to the underlying facts relevant to these
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents, Arjun&nbsp;Panday, Julian&nbsp;Yue and Maneesh&nbsp;Jalota,
    were convicted of various serious criminal offences at the conclusion of
    a six&#8209;week jury trial before Benotto&nbsp;J.  Mr.&nbsp;Panday was convicted
    of extortion with a firearm (two counts), forcible confinement, conspiracy
    to commit extortion with a firearm, and possession of a restricted firearm
    with ammunition.  Mr.&nbsp;Yue was convicted of extortion with a firearm
    and conspiracy to commit extortion with a firearm.  Mr.&nbsp;Jalota was convicted
    of extortion (two counts), forcible confinement (two counts), and conspiracy
    to commit extortion with a firearm.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    offences all stemmed from the respondents’
    efforts to forcibly gain control of the business of promoting nightclub events
    within the South Asian community in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The offences relate to extortion efforts concerning three victims <span style='font-family:Symbol;"Times New Roman";'>-</span> Vivek&nbsp;Malhotra,
    Selvin Mathew and Atif Mahmood.  These men were business partners and well&#8209;known
    event promoters, servicing the South Asian market in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  They were known as industry leaders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relevant events occurred on two days, February 8 and 18, 2003.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(a)       </span>Events
    of February 8, 2003</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the afternoon of Saturday, February 8, 2003, Mr. Malhotra was lured to Mr.
    Panday’<span lang=EN-US>s place of employment, an office above a restaurant
    on Avenue Road, on the pretext of attending a meeting to discuss a sponsorship
    agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after arriving, Mr. Malhotra was surrounded by Mr. Panday, Mr. Yue, Mr. Jalota
    and several other parties.  An uzi machine pistol was brandished by one of
    the men present.  Mr. Panday took control of the meeting and informed Mr.
    Malhotra that he was being extorted.  Mr. Malhotra was presented with a piece
    of paper listing the names and addresses of a number of Mr. Malhotra’s family
    members.  Mr. Malhotra was then forced at gunpoint to sign a contract indicating
    that he would pay 30% of his gross revenues to Mr. Panday in exchange for
    vaguely described “security services”.  He was told that it would be in his
    and his family’s best interest if he signed the contract.  The uzi was placed
    against his head and body at various times.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>About
      an hour into this confrontation, Mr. Malhotra was required, at gunpoint,
      to call his partner, Mr. Mathew, and ask him to attend the meeting.  When
      Mr. Mathew arrived, he was subjected to similar threats, also at gunpoint,
      and forced to sign an identical contract.  The two men were then permitted
      to leave after being warned not to contact police or tell anyone.  They
      had been held in the office for approximately three hours.  Throughout,
      Mr. Panday did not handle the uzi himself, but he did the majority of the
      talking and directed the meeting.  In her reasons for sentence, Benotto&nbsp;J.
      therefore referred to Mr. Panday as the
    “ringleader” of the scheme.  Mr. Yue held the uzi for some period of time
    during the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>After
      leaving the office, Mr. Malhotra and Mr. Mathew spent approximately 48
      hours trying to decide what to do before ultimately contacting the police.  An
      investigation was commenced and, in co-operation with the police, Mr. Malhotra
      and Mr. Mathew pretended to have quit the business (another option given
      to them by Mr. Panday in the meeting).  They then allowed their third partner,
      Mr. Mahmood, to take over the promotion of the events that they had previously
      run.</span></p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>After
      the February 8, 2003 extortions, information was received from a woman
      who was a mutual friend of Mr. Panday and Mr. Mahmood.  As a result of
      this information, it became known that Mr. Panday intended to also extort
      Mr. Mahmood, as he was seen to be taking over the business for Mr. Malhotra
      and Mr. Mathew.  Indeed, Mr. Panday’s plan was to surprise Mr.&nbsp;Mahmood
      at a Kelsey’s restaurant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough when Mr. Mahmood went there to meet their mutual friend.  Mr.
    Panday’s plan was to then force Mr. Mahmood to sign a contract, similar to
    the contracts signed by Mr. Malhotra and Mr. Mathew, at gunpoint.  This meeting
    was to take place at approximately 8 p.m. on February 18, 2003.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    learned of this plan, surveillance teams from the Toronto Police Service
    followed Mr. Panday as he left his home on the evening of February 18, 2003.  Mr.&nbsp;Panday
    then met up with Mr. Yue, who had his own vehicle, and the men drove in tandem
    to the Kelsey’s restaurant, arriving about 7:55 p.m.  Also arriving at that
    time, in another vehicle, was Mr. Jalota.  Police arrested all three parties
    at their cars in the Kelsey’s parking lot.  In the trunk of the vehicle being
    driven by Mr.&nbsp;Panday was a contract, which was identified at trial by
    Mr. Malhotra and Mr.&nbsp;Mathew as being virtually identical to the one
    they had been forced to sign on February 8, 2003.  It was unsigned, but was
    dated February 18, 2003, and the listed parties were Arjun Panday and NGM
    Entertainment, which is the name of Mr.&nbsp;Mahmood’s promotion company.<span style='font-size:10.0pt;'>  </span>Also
    located in the trunk of Mr. Panday’s car was a .357 calibre revolver, along
    with ammunition.</p>

    sentences</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    their arrests, the respondents spent a substantial amount of time on strict
    bail awaiting their trial <span
style='font-family:Symbol;"Times New Roman";'>-</span> thirty&#8209;two months
    for Messrs.&nbsp;Panday and Jalota and thirty&#8209;four months for Mr.&nbsp;Yue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    they were convicted, the respondents were subject to a minimum sentence of
    four years for extortion with a firearm, s.&nbsp;346(1.1)(a), and conspiracy
    to commit extortion with a firearm, s.&nbsp;465(1)(c).  Mr.&nbsp;Panday was
    subject to an additional minimum sentence of one year for possession of a
    firearm, s.&nbsp;95(2)(a).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown and the accused agreed that the minimum sentences <span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>-</span> and nothing more <span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>-</span> were appropriate (none of the accused had prior criminal records).  They
    also agreed that credit be given, on the standard 2:1 basis, for pre&#8209;trial
    custody.  The sentencing judge accepted these joint submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only issue that divided the Crown and the accused was whether the sentencing
    judge, in imposing the minimum sentences she was required to impose, could
    give credit for the time spent on strict bail by the accused.  Relying on
    her interpretation of the almost contemporaneous decision of this court in <i>R.
    v. Downes</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 488, the sentencing judge held that
    this option was open to her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This issue was fully argued by counsel before and
    again after the release on February 14<sup>th</sup> of the <i>R. v. Downes</i> decision
    of the Court of Appeal.  That decision extensively deals with the way the
    trial judge is to consider pre&#8209;trial house arrest.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At paragraph 37, Justice Rosenberg says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>In summary, credit for pre-trial bail conditions
    should be approached in the following manner:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Time
    spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions, especially house arrest,
    is a relevant mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    such, the trial judge must consider the time spent on bail under house arrest
    in determining the length of sentence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    failure of the trial judge to explain why time spent on bail under house

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Justice Rosenberg does not qualify his reasons by
    excluding situations where there is a mandatory minimum sentence required.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In <i>Downes</i>, he referred to section 719, and
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>… there is no suggestion that this provision
    limits the right of a sentencing court to take into account, as a mitigating
    factor, time spent on pre-sentence bail.  (pgh. 26)</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although Justice Rosenberg refers to pre&#8209;trial
    house arrest as a mitigating factor, he does give it special significance
    by requiring the trial judge to give reasons if credit is not given.  Nowhere
    does he say it does not apply to a mandatory minimum situation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Indeed, at paragraph 29, he says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>On the other hand, some of the same considerations
    that justify credit for pre-sentence custody apply to an offender who has
    spent a long time under house arrest.  Stringent bail conditions, especially
    house arrest, represent an infringement on liberty and are, to that extent,
    inconsistent with the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence.  House
    arrest is a form of punishment, albeit of a different character than actual
    incarceration.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This analysis is not qualified.  I thus do not accept
    the Crown’s position that I have no discretion to give credit which would
    take the sentence below the mandatory sentence.</p>

    that strict pre&#8209;sentence bail conditions constitute a “punishment of
    imprisonment” within the meaning of ss.&nbsp;346(1.1)(a) and 95(2)(a) of

    reduce judicial discretion in the sentencing process.  However, that is the
    effect of mandatory minimum sentences which, by definition, remove much of
    the discretion that sentencing judges otherwise possess.  Speaking of the
    mandatory minimum sentence established by s.&nbsp;344(a) of the <i>Criminal

    problem with this analysis is that it overlooks the crucial fact that, by
    definition, sentencing judges are afforded less discretion when a minimum
    sentence is involved.  The reality is that when a person is convicted of
    an offence that carries a minimum sentence, the sentencing judge does not
    engage in the usual balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors to arrive
    at an appropriate sentence.  Indeed, the statutory minimum sentence specifically
    excludes such a balancing up to the point of the minimum sentence.<a href="#_ftn1"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the starting point for the analysis in these appeals should be the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provision that creates and defines bail:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>515.(1)   Subject to this section, where an accused
    who is charged with an offence other than an offence listed in section&nbsp;469
    is taken before a justice, the justice shall, unless a plea of guilty by
    the accused is accepted, order, in respect of that offence, <i>that the accused
    be released</i> on his giving an undertaking without conditions, unless the
    prosecutor, having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, shows cause,
    in respect of that offence, why <i>the detention of the accused in custody</i> is
    justified or why an order under any other provision of this section should
    be made and where the justice makes an order under any other provision of
    this section, the order shall refer only to the particular offence for which
    the accused was taken before the justice.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>        (2) Where the justice does not make an order
    under subsection (1), he shall, unless the prosecutor shows cause why <i>the
    detention</i> <i>of the accused</i> is justified, order that <i>the accused
    be released</i> ….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>        (10) For the purposes of this section, <i>the
      detention of an accused in custody</i> is justified only on one or more
      of the following grounds:….                      [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    observation about the wording of this provision is that Parliament has created
    a clear dichotomy between, on the one hand, pre&#8209;trial release and,
    on the other hand, pre&#8209;trial detention in custody.  Put bluntly, bail
    is not jail.  The wording of s.&nbsp;515 makes it clear that bail is what
    an accused person seeks in order to stay out of jail.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    saying this, I do not suggest that bail is not a restraint on the liberty
    of an accused person.  It is a restraint and, where there are strict bail
    conditions, it can be a serious restraint.  However, statutory words must
    be given their natural meaning, and the natural meaning of “release”, “detention” and “custody” suggests
    that there is a fundamental difference between bail and jail.  The natural
    meaning of these words <span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>-</span> known at a practical, common sense level by all accused persons who
    seek bail <span style='font-family:
Symbol;
'>-</span> is that the pith and substance of bail is liberty, whereas the essence
    of jail is a profound loss of liberty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second and, in my view, crucial <i>Criminal Code</i> provision that needs
    to be considered is s.&nbsp;719:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>719.(1) A sentence commences when it is imposed,
    except where a relevant enactment otherwise provides.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>        (3) In determining the sentence to be imposed
    on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time
    spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a plain meaning of s.&nbsp;719(3), time spent <i>in custody</i> may be taken
    into account by a sentencing judge.  As explained by Arbour&nbsp;J. in <i>Wust</i> at
    para. 41:
    “Therefore, while pre&#8209;trial detention is not intended as punishment
    when it is imposed, it is, in effect, deemed part of the punishment following
    the offender’s conviction, by the operation of s.&nbsp;719(3).”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to note that Arbour&nbsp;J. used the word ‘detention’ in this
    explanation.  This is the same word employed in s.&nbsp;515 to describe a
    person who does not obtain bail; such a person is subject to “detention…in
    custody”.  The implication, in my view, is clear: just as s.&nbsp;515 creates
    a clear dichotomy between release and detention in custody, so too does s.&nbsp;719(3)
    make the same distinction.  In determining a sentence, including a minimum
    sentence, a sentencing judge can take into account “time spent in custody” (s.&nbsp;719(3))
    or “detention” (<i>Wust</i>); however, time spent out of custody or not in
    detention&nbsp;<span
style='font-family:Symbol;"Times New Roman";'>-</span> i.e. bail <span style='font-family:Symbol;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    interpretation is supported by a review of the legislative history relating
    to s.&nbsp;719(3) which was enacted as part of the <i>Bail Reform Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c.&nbsp;2.  In <i>McDonald</i>, Rosenberg J.A. referred
    to some of this legislative history at paras. 36&#8209;37: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>During House of Commons Debates (5 February 1971)
    at second reading of Bill&nbsp;C&#8209;218, Amendment of Provisions of the
    Criminal Code relating to Arrest and Bail, the Minister of Justice, John
    Turner, stated clearly the government's intention in reference to the new
    provision at p. 3118:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>Generally speaking, the courts in deciding what
    sentence to impose on a person convicted of an offence take into account
    the time he has spent in custody awaiting trial.  <i>However, under the present
    Criminal Code, a sentence commences only when it is imposed, and the court’s
    hands are tied in those cases where a minimum term of imprisonment must be
    imposed.  In such cases, therefore, the court is bound to impose not less
    than the minimum sentence even though the convicted person may have been
    in custody</i> awaiting trial for a period in excess of the minimum sentence.  <i>The
    new version of the bill would permit the court, in a proper case, to take
    this time into account in imposing sentence</i>.<u>  </u>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This was also the understanding of John Scollin.  I
    find his views of particular assistance since he was with the Department
    of Justice at the time the <i>Bail Reform Act</i> was introduced and testified
    before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.  In his text, <i>The
    Bail Reform Act:  An Analysis of Amendments to the Criminal Code Related
    to Bail and Arrest</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 1972) at p. 91, he summarizes
    the effect of the new provision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>This subsection gives statutory sanction to
    the practice of the courts in taking into account in determining sentence
    the time that an accused has already spent in custody as a result of the
    offence.  An important extension, however, is that the court will now be
    able to take such time into account <i>even in the case where there is a
    minimum sentence</i> which would otherwise not commence until it is imposed.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>

    Arbour J. approved of Rosenberg&nbsp;J.A.’s review in <i>McDonald</i> of
    the legislative history relating to s.&nbsp;719(3).  She stated, at para.
    31:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As was pointed out by Rosenberg J.A. in <i>McDonald</i> at
    p.&nbsp;73, Parliament enacted the forerunner to s.&nbsp;719(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> as part of the <i>Bail Reform Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;2 (2nd
    Supp.), for the very specific purpose of ensuring that the well&#8209;established
    practice of sentencing judges to give credit for time served while computing
    a sentence would be available even to reduce a sentence below the minimum
    fixed by law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the words used by the Minister of Justice, a senior lawyer in the
    Department of Justice, and Arbour J. <span

    custody awaiting trial”, “the time that an accused has already spent in custody

style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows from this analysis of the wording of ss.&nbsp;515 and 719(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> that strict bail does not constitute a “punishment of imprisonment”
    within the meaning of ss.&nbsp;346(1.1)(a) and 95(2)(a) of the <i>Code</i> (and
    other similar minimum sentence provisions).  Indeed, it seems to me that
    this basic point was clearly recognized in <i>Downes</i> itself at para.&nbsp;29: “House
    arrest is a form of punishment, albeit of a different character than actual
    incarceration.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    need to refer to one other provision of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  One of
    the respondents’ principal arguments is that at a factual level strict bail
    can closely resemble a conditional sentence; the core of both types of restraint
    on liberty is often some kind of
    ‘house arrest’ regime.  Since <i>Wust</i> stands for the proposition that
    credit towards a minimum sentence can be given for time spent in pre&#8209;trial
    custody, and since conditional sentences constitute imprisonment (see <i>R.
    v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para.&nbsp;29 (S.C.C.)), it
    follows, the respondents submit, that strict bail should also be regarded
    as a form of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accepting
    the factual similarities between strict bail and some conditional sentences,
    in my view the extension sought by the respondents must be rejected because
    of the express wording of s.&nbsp;742.1 of the <i>Code</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>742.1  Where a person is convicted of an offence, <i>except
      an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment</i>, and
      the court </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       <i>imposes a sentence of imprisonment
      of less than two years</i>, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       is satisfied that serving the sentence
    in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would
    be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set
    out in sections 718 to 718.2,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>the court may, for the purpose of supervising the
    offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the
    sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions
    of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.                           [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents are ineligible for consideration for conditional sentences for
    two reasons: they are subject to mandatory minimum sentences and their sentences
    exceed two years less a day.  In this situation, mandated by the clear wording
    of s.&nbsp;742.1, it would make no sense to permit the respondents to overcome
    (admittedly, only partially) those clear constraints through the back door
    of giving credit for strict bail.  In short, if a conditional sentence cannot
    be imposed in the case of a minimum sentence, it would be illogical and inconsistent
    to give credit for time spent out of custody under strict bail conditions,
    which is akin to a conditional sentence, so as to avoid the imposition of
    a minimum sentence declared by Parliament.</p>

    issue to be resolved on these Crown appeals against sentence is whether,

    the trial judge erred by giving them credit on approximately a one-for-five

      this court held that credit may be given for strict pre-sentence bail conditions

    a six-week jury trial, the respondents were convicted of various offences,
    all of which stemmed from their use of force and weapons in an attempt to
    gain control of the promotion of nightclub events aimed at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto’s South Asian community.  The respondents lured three victims, who
    were well-known businessmen engaged in the promotion of entertainment events,
    to a meeting where an Uzi machine pistol was brandished.  The respondents
    were arrested as a result of police surveillance prior to a second planned
    meeting and were found to be in possession of a .357 calibre revolver and
    ammunition.  All three respondents were convicted of firearms offences attracting
    mandatory minimum sentences.</p>

    respondents were in their early twenties and had no prior criminal records.  They
    each spent some time in pre-sentence custody and were then released on conditions
    amounting to house arrest.  Throughout the entire thirty-two month period,
    Panday could not leave home for any purpose unless accompanied by a surety.  Jalota
    spent thirty-two months under house arrest but was permitted to leave his
    home if accompanied by one of his parents; his bail conditions also contained
    exceptions for attending school, employment, medical emergencies and religious
    observance.  Yue’s conditions were varied after one year to permit him to
    go to and from employment or education without his surety.  He spent a total
    of thirty-four months under strict bail conditions. </p>

    Crown and defence agreed on the appropriate sentence, namely, the mandatory
    minimum sentences of five years for Panday and four years for Yue and Jalota,
    such sentences to be served concurrently with the sentences for the other
    related offences.  The Crown also agreed that each respondent should receive
    two-for-one credit for time spent in pre-sentence custody.  However, the
    Crown resisted the respondents’
    submission that they should also receive some credit for the time they had
    spent on pre-sentence house arrest bail.  The trial judge disagreed with
    the Crown and, applying <i>Downes</i>, gave the respondents the following
    additional credit: Panday received six months credit for thirty-two months
    on house arrest bail; Yue received seven months credit for thirty-four months
    on house arrest bail; and Jalota received five and one-half months credit
    for thirty-two months on house arrest bail.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ordinarily,
    a trial judge has a wide discretion to impose what he or she considers to
    be a fit sentence.  Mandatory minimum sentences are the exception, not the
    rule, in Canadian law.  That said, I entirely agree that when Parliament
    decides to specify a mandatory minimum sentence, provided the mandatory minimum
    sentence does not violate the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, the
    trial judge must impose the sentence Parliament has deemed to be appropriate
    for the offence.  However, there are few, if any, legal rules or statutory
    provisions that can be applied simply and mechanically without due consideration
    of more general legal rules and principles.  This applies with equal force
    to mandatory minimum sentences.  Legislation imposing mandatory minimum sentences
    does not oust all other legal principles.  It must, rather, be interpreted
    and applied in a manner that takes into account generally applicable rules
    and principles of sentencing that have not been specifically excluded from
    consideration by Parliament.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is well established that time spent in custody before trial will ordinarily
    be counted towards sentence.  This principle also applies even where the
    result is to reduce the length of the sentence imposed after conviction to
    a period that is shorter than the minimum sentence.  In other words, a trial
    judge does not violate Parliament’s direction regarding a minimum sentence
    by giving credit for time already served in pre-sentence custody and imposing
    a sentence that is shorter than the mandatory minimum.  The rationale for
    this result is that the offender will still have suffered a penalty equivalent
    to the mandatory minimum: see <i>Wust</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 41; <i>R.
    v. Fice</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 18.</p>

    is also now an established principle of sentencing that the trial judge must
    consider giving some credit for time spent under strict pre-sentence bail
    conditions: see<i> Downes</i>.  The <i>Downes</i> principle, like that regarding
    pre-sentence custody, emerges from cases involving ordinary sentences.  For
    reasons I will endeavour to explain more fully below, I see no reason why
    the <i>Downes</i> principle should not also apply to mandatory minimum sentences. </p>

    take as my starting point <i>Wust</i>, <i>supra</i>, where Arbour J. described
    the approach that should be taken to the interpretation of minimum sentences:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[18]  Mandatory minimum sentences are not the norm
    in this country, and they depart from the general principles of sentencing
    expressed in the <i>Code</i>, in the case law, and in the literature on sentencing.  In
    particular, they often detract from what Parliament has expressed as the
    fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the <i>Code</i>: the principle
    of proportionality.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[21] …It is a well-established principle of the
    criminal justice system that judges must strive to impose a sentence tailored
    to the individual case [citations omitted].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[22]  Consequently, <i>it is important to interpret
      legislation which deals, directly and indirectly, with mandatory minimum
      sentences, in a manner that is consistent with general principles of sentencing,
      and that does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system</i>.

    a package of <i>Criminal Code</i> amendments imposing mandatory minimum sentences
    for crimes committed with a firearm.  The minimum sentence at issue in <i>Wust </i>was
    introduced into the <i>Code</i> as part of the same package.  Arbour J.,
    writing for an unanimous court in <i>Wust </i>observed, at para. 27, that
    when enacting these minimum sentences for firearms offences, Parliament did
    not intend “to alter the general administration of sentences in a way that
    would distinguish the new mandatory minimums from other sentences.”  Accordingly,
    Arbour J. held that Parliament did not intend to remove minimum punishment
    offences from the general scheme governing the imposition and administration

    J.A. writes at para. 31 of his reasons: “Put simply bail is not jail” and
    he proceeds to treat them as if they were opposites.  I disagree with my
    colleague’s classification.  Bail and jail are different points on a continuum
    between complete freedom and total deprivation of liberty.  Strict conditions
    amounting to house arrest significantly constrain liberty and push bail towards
    the total deprivation of liberty end of the continuum.  I therefore cannot
    agree with my colleague’s statement at para. 32 that “the pith and substance
    of bail is liberty”.  For the following reasons, I conclude that house arrest
    bail of the kind at issue on these appeals amounts to a form of state-imposed
    punishment sufficiently close to total deprivation of liberty to have afforded
    the trial judge the discretion to conclude that it amounted to the equivalent
    of “punishment of imprisonment” on a one to five basis. </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span class=DoubleIndentQuoteChar><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Str</span></span>ingent bail conditions,
    especially house arrest, represent an infringement on liberty and are, to
    that extent, inconsistent with the fundamental principle of the presumption
    of innocence.  House arrest is a form of punishment, albeit of a different
    character than actual incarceration.  Pre-sentence house arrest varies little
    in character from the house arrest that is often imposed as a term of a conditional
    sentence under s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. … [I]n <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000),
    140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 103, Lamer C.J.C. identified house
    arrest as a form of punishment in the conditional sentence context:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><i>First, the conditions should have a punitive
      aspect</i>. Indeed, the need for punitive conditions is the reason why
      a probationary sentence was rejected and a sentence of imprisonment of
      less than two years imposed.  As stated above, conditions such as house
      arrest should be the norm, not the exception.  <i>This means that the offender
      should be confined to his or her home except when working, attending school,
      or fulfilling other conditions of his or her sentence</i>, e.g. community
      service, meeting with the supervisor, or participating in treatment programs.
      Of course, there will need to be exceptions for medical emergencies, religious
      observance, and the like.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    deemed to be “a continuation of the offender’s sentence of incarceration”: <i> Wust</i>,

    a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years before considering whether
    the sentence can be served in the community subject to the appropriate conditions.  Parliament
    intended imprisonment, in the form of incarceration, to be more punitive
    than probation, as it is far more restrictive of the offender’s liberty.

    when read in conjunction with <i>R. v. Fice</i>, <i>supra</i>, stating at
    para. 18, that “time spent in pre-sentence custody is part of the total punishment
    imposed; it is not a mitigating factor that can affect the range of sentence”,
    requires us to exclude pre-sentence house arrest as forming part of the total
    punishment of imprisonment to reduce the time to be served.</p>

    am not persuaded that the characterization in <i>Downes</i> of strict bail
    conditions as a “mitigating factor” is determinative of the issue we are
    considering here.  In my view, the word “mitigating” in this context means
    no more than capable of reducing.  Strict bail conditions are state-imposed
    restrictions on liberty, a factor entirely unrelated to the consideration
    of the usual mitigating factors that relate to the subjective personal circumstances
    and characteristics of the offender. </p>

    note that at several points in his reasons, Rosenberg J.A. refers to the “credit” that
    is to be given for strict bail conditions, a phrase that is inapt for the
    usual mitigating factors of age, lack of record, demonstration of remorse
    or reparation of harm and the like.  In my view, the characterization in <i>Downes</i> of
    strict pre-sentence bail conditions as “mitigating circumstances” merely
    reflects the fact that no fixed or <i>a priori</i> formula can be used to
    determine the precise credit to be given: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[36]  Thus, a trial judge faced with an offender
    who has spent time on bail under house arrest should adopt a flexible approach.  In
    the end, the <i>amount of credit</i> and the manner in which it is taken
    into account as a mitigating factor is a matter for the trial judge.  That
    factor <i>must be considered along with</i> the myriad of other mitigating
    and aggravating circumstances that may impact on the sentence in a given
    case. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown reads the last sentence of the quotation conjunctively, making house
    arrest one mitigating factor among others.  I prefer to read it disjunctively.  House
    arrest is set apart as categorically different from other traditional mitigating
    factors.  This interpretation is supported by the use of the word “credit”,
    which suggests that strict pre-sentence bail conditions are conceptually
    more akin to pre-sentence custody than to mitigating factors that may be
    taken into account to reduce the sentence, but for which no “credit” is given.  </p>

    719(2) applies to time spent by <i>convicted persons</i> at large on interim
    release and is directed to the corrections officials charged with the duty
    of calculating the length of the sentence, not the sentencing judge charged

    do not accept the submission that by omitting any reference to out-of-custody
    pre-sentence time in s. 719(3), Parliament must be taken to have excluded
    consideration of strict pre-trial bail conditions when imposing sentence.  The
    legislative history and intention of s. 719(3) was reviewed in <i>McDonald</i> and
    affirmed in <i>Wust</i>.  In <i> McDonald</i>, Rosenberg J.A. held, at paras.
    23 and 26, that s. 719(3) was not “a mere codification of a principle of
    sentencing” allowing a court to reduce the term of imprisonment it would
    otherwise impose by the period of imprisonment already served, but a provision
    giving a court a substantive power” to give credit for time served in pre-sentence
    custody against a mandatory minimum sentence.  He supported this interpretation
    by examining the legislative history of s. 719(3), which was enacted as part
    of the <i>Bail Reform Act</i> in 1970, at paras. 28-37.  I reproduce paras.
    36 and 37:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>[</span>36] During House of Commons Debates (5 February 1971) at second reading
    of Bill C-218, “Amendment of Provisions of the Criminal Code relating to
    Arrest and Bail”, the Minister of Justice, John Turner, stated clearly the
    government’s intention in reference to the new provision at p. 3118: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>Generally speaking, the courts in deciding what
    sentence to impose on a person convicted of an offence take into account
    the time he has spent in custody awaiting trial.  <i>However, under the present
    Criminal Code, a sentence commences only when it is imposed, and the court’s
    hands are tied in those cases where a minimum term of imprisonment must be
    imposed.  In such cases, therefore, the court is bound to impose not less
    than the minimum sentence even though the convicted person may have been
    in custody</i> awaiting trial for a period in excess of the minimum sentence.  <i>The
    new version of the bill would permit the court, in a proper case, to take
    this time into account in imposing sentence</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[37] This was also the understanding of John Scollin.  I
    find his views of particular assistance since he was with the Department
    of Justice at the time the <i>Bail Reform Act</i> was introduced and testified
    before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.  In his text, <i>The
    Bail Reform Act: An Analysis of Amendments to the Criminal Code Related to
    Bail and Arrest</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 1972) at p. 91, he summarizes the
    effect of the new provision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>This subsection gives statutory sanction to
    the practice of the courts in taking into account in determining sentence
    the time that an accused has already spent in custody as a result of the
    offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;An important extension, however, is that the court will
    now be able to take such time into account <i>even in the case where there
    is a minimum sentence</i> which would otherwise not commence until it is
    imposed. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Wust</i>,<i> </i>at para. 31.  </p>

    Crown argues that the limitation of s. 719(3) to “time spent in custody” indicates
    Parliament’s intent that strict pre-sentence bail conditions should not be
    taken into account by a trial judge.  In my view, that would represent a
    strained reading of s.&nbsp;719(3), especially in light of the <i>Wust</i> principle
    that legislation imposing mandatory minimum sentences must be interpreted
    as conforming to the general scheme for imposing and administering sentences
    unless it is unreasonable to do so: see para 22. </p>

    legislative history demonstrates that when s. 719(3) was enacted, Parliament
    was concerned about the unfairness that would result if credit for pre-sentence
    custody was not given for mandatory minimum offences.  There is nothing to
    suggest that when enacting remedial legislation to remedy what was perceived
    to be one injustice, Parliament intended <i>to preclude</i> judges from taking
    into account <i>other</i> factors that could cause unfairness and certainly
    nothing to indicate that Parliament had strict pre-sentence bail conditions
    or house arrest–a relatively recent phenomenon–in mind. </p>

    my view, s. 719(3) is properly conceived of as a precise legislative response
    to the specific issue of the unfairness that would result if pre-sentence
    custody was not taken into account in determining what punishment the offender
    had already received from the state.  The provision is not sufficiently explicit
    to indicate that Parliament had the positive intention to preclude trial
    judges from taking into account strict pre-sentence bail conditions.  At
    best, the provision is ambiguous and any ambiguity must be resolved in favour
    of the liberty of the accused.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Conditional Sentence of Imprisonment</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=noarticlepara><span

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(<i>b</i>) is satisfied that serving the sentence
    in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would
    be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set
    out in sections 718 to 718.2,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>the court may, for the purpose of supervising the
    offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the
    sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions
    of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that because a conditional sentence cannot be imposed for offences
    that are subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, even where the period remaining
    to be served after pre-sentence custody is taken into account is less than
    two years (see <i>Fice</i>, <i>supra</i>), house arrest bail cannot be considered
    to be a form of “punishment of imprisonment”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree with this submission.  Giving credit for house arrest bail rests
    upon a judicial determination that the offender has served the legal equivalent
    of a
    “punishment of imprisonment” for the period of time for which credit is given.  This
    judicial recognition of credit for a punishment that has already been inflicted
    on the offender does not conflict with s. 718.3 nor does it violate the statutory
    preclusion against the imposition of a conditional sentence that will take
    effect in the future in relation to an offence attracting a mandatory minimum
    sentence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see nothing in <i>Fice </i>that requires a different interpretation.  As
    I read that judgment, the determinative point was that the availability of
    a conditional sentence on a going-forward basis is keyed to the gravity of
    the offence, a factor only tangentially related to pre-trial custody.  At
    para. 24 of <i>Fice</i>, Bastarache J. stated, “In my view, spending time
    in custody pre-sentence in no way changes the gravity of the offence, the
    degree of responsibility of the offender, or, as it was put in <i>Proulx</i>,
    the ‘type of offender’.  Thus, it is clear that time spent in pre-sentence
    custody is not a mitigating factor”.  Onerous pre-sentence bail conditions,
    as is recognized in <i>Downes</i>, do not change the gravity of the offence,
    the degree of responsibility of the offender or the type of offender.  They
    do, however, constitute a form of state-imposed punishment akin to imprisonment,
    and it is that feature that is pertinent to the issue of credit upon sentencing. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent that there is any doubt on these points of statutory construction
    and the authorities to which I have referred fail to establish <i>conclusively</i> that
    pre-sentence house arrest amounts to a form of “punishment of imprisonment”,
    it seems to me that at best these <i>Code </i>provisions are ambiguous.  This
    means that the interpretive principle requiring statutory ambiguities to
    be construed in favour of the accused comes into play.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    to the extent that further support is required for an interpretation favourable
    to the accused, I agree with the respondents that permitting the trial judge
    to consider pre-sentence bail conditions in relation to a mandatory minimum
    sentence would better enhance <i>Charter</i> values. In <i>McDonald</i>,
    Rosenberg J.A. observed, at para. 63, that pre-sentence custody implicates <i>Charter </i>values
    in an important way: while pre-sentence custody or onerous bail conditions
    are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption
    of innocence (see <i>R. v. Pearson</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 124 (S.C.C.);
    and <i>R. v. Morales</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (S.C.C.)), “pre-trial
    custody falls more heavily upon those persons who assert their innocence
    and insist on exercising their constitutional rights to require the Crown
    to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt before a jury of their peers”.  Thus,
    Rosenberg J.A. concludes at para. 64, the court should “adopt an interpretation
    [of the <i>Code </i>provisions] that does not impose upon accused persons
    the added burden that the additional time in custody necessitated by the
    exercise of their constitutional rights will not even count against the sentence
    if they are eventually convicted.”  This direction is approved of in <i>Wust</i>,
    at para.&nbsp;34.  Although pre-sentence custody is clearly more onerous
    than house arrest bail, the distinction is one of degree, not kind.  Rosenberg
    J.A.’s direction in <i>McDonald</i> is thus apposite here.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    general principles of sentencing law, the trial judge found on the facts
    that thirty-two to thirty-four months of pre-sentence house arrest amounted
    to the equivalent of five and one-half to seven months of actual custody.  In
    my view, the statutory language is at least reasonably capable of supporting
    the trial judge’s interpretation and it therefore follows that the trial
    judge’s interpretation favouring the liberty of the accused should be maintained.  For
    the reasons I have given, I would thus grant the Crown’s applications for
    leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeals.</p>
