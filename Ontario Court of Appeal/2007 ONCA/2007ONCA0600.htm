    Ltd. (“GCCL”), which was placed in bankruptcy effective November 18, 2005.  Its
    interim receiver has accumulated $6.5 million from GCCL’s operating assets,
    including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, and seeks the court’s
    authorization to make an interim distribution from these funds to Harbert,
    as secured creditor, in the amount of $3.75 million.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    proposal is opposed by the administrator of GCCL’s two pension plans and
    by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (“MOE”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    administrator says that, pursuant to s. 57(5) of the <i>Pension Benefits
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (“<i>PBA</i>”), it holds a lien over GCCL’s
    assets in relation to GCCL’s unpaid pension contributions, and this gives
    it priority over Harbert’s security.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MOE
    says that GCCL has failed to comply with provincial environmental safety
    requirements, and there will therefore be significant cleanup costs that
    exceed GCCL’s financial assurance given under the <i>Environmental Protection
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19 (“EPA”).  MOE says that GCCL and its interim
    receiver have an obligation to meet these costs, and that any distribution
    at this stage is premature and may leave no assets for environmental remediation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    first instance, the motion judge found against both the administrator and
    MOE, and authorized the interim distribution to Harbert. Both the administrator
    and MOE have appealed.  The appeals were argued together, although they each
    raise their own issues.  I therefore propose to address each separately.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    each case, I agree with the result reached by the motion judge, although
    for somewhat different reasons.</p>
  <h4>THE ADMINISTRATOR’S APPEAL</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Until
    January 2005, when it discontinued operations, GCCL manufactured calcium
    chloride at its plant in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Amherstburg,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  On March 31, 2004, Harbert advanced $9 million to GCCL, secured
    against GCCL’s operating assets. No one questions that Harbert’s security
    instruments were properly registered under the <i>Personal Property Security
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (“<i>PPSA</i>”), and constitute a perfected
    security interest in GCCL’s personal property as of that date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    GCCL developed financial problems, and on January 19, 2005, it was ordered
    under the protection of the <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, (“<i>CCAA</i>”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    November 2005, it became clear that GCCL’s attempt to restructure while under <i>CCAA</i> protection
    was unlikely to succeed.  Effective November 18, 2005, pursuant to the order
    of C. Campbell J. of the Superior Court of Justice, GCCL made an assignment
    in bankruptcy and an interim receiver of certain of its assets was appointed
    pursuant to the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3
    (“<i>BIA</i>”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GCCL
    maintained two pension plans for its employees, one for its salaried employees
    and one for its unionized employees.  Both are defined benefit plans and
    both are completely employer funded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Until
    about January 2004, GCCL was making the contributions due under both plans.  At
    that point, it began to fall into arrears, and by March 31, 2004, the date
    Harbert’s security was perfected, that shortfall was $1,356,230 for the union
    plan and $107,499 for the salaried plan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    March 31, 2004, while GCCL made several sporadic payments to both plans,
    the shortfalls continued to grow.  The only exception to this pattern occurred
    in October and November 2004 when GCCL made payments to both plans in excess
    of the required contributions for those months. That excess amounted to $2,164,492
    for the union plan and $113,472 for the salaried plan. Thereafter, the shortfalls
    continued to grow, although nothing in the <i>CCAA</i> order prohibited GCCL
    from making the required contributions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>PBA </i>requires
    that every pension plan have an administrator. Up until its bankruptcy on
    November 18, 2005, GCCL served in that role for both plans.  However on December
    8, 2005, the Ontario Superintendent of Financial Services, in his capacity
    as the regulator of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario registered pension plans, appointed Morneau Sobeco Limited Partnership
    (the
    “Administrator”) as the administrator of both plans pursuant to s. 71 of
    the <i>PBA</i>.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    proceeding arose because the interim receiver has now collected $6.5 million
    from GCCL’s general operations. These funds do not come from any of GCCL’s
    real estate holdings. Since it views Harbert as the only creditor with security
    against GCCL’s operating assets, the interim proposes to distribute $3.75
    million of those funds to Harbert as secured creditor.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Administrator opposes the motion approving that payment because of the security
    it says it has under the <i>PBA</i>.  At the same time, the Administrator
    moved for a declaration that its security pursuant to s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA</i> makes
    it a secured creditor ranking ahead of Harbert’s security.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge granted the interim receiver’s motion and dismissed that of
    the Administrator.  She found that the lien created by s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA</i> was
    not enforceable under the <i>BIA</i> because it was an attempt by the province
    to do indirectly what it could not do directly, namely to legislate priority
    under the <i>BIA</i> for unpaid pension plan contributions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    drew support for this conclusion from Bill C-55, <i>An Act to establish the
    Wage Earner Protection Program Act, to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Act and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act and to make consequential
    amendments to other Acts, </i>1<sup>st</sup> Sess., 38<sup>th</sup> Parl.,
    2005 (assented to 25 November 2005), which has been passed by the federal
    Parliament but not proclaimed, and which would create a “pension charge” over
    a debtor’s assets for unpaid pension plan contributions of the kind in issue
    here.  The motion judge concluded that since this amendment must be designed
    to alter the current state of the law, no such security presently exists.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge went on to find that even if the Administrator held a lien effective
    for <i>BIA</i> purposes, the rule in <i>Devaynes v. Noble (Clayton’s</i> <i>Case) </i>(1816),
    1 Mer. 572, 35 E.R. 781 (C.A.), should be applied, and absent any evident
    intention at the time of the excess contributions paid by GCCL in October
    and November 2004 as to which particular deficiencies they were to apply
    to, they should be applied to reduce the earliest pension indebtedness. This
    would eliminate all shortfalls prior to the effective date of Harbert’s security
    for which the Administrator might have had priority.  </p>
  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    important section of the <i>PBA</i> for the Administrator’s appeal is s.
    57.  Section 57(1) applies to employee contributions required under a pension
    plan and hence is not relevant here, where both plans are completely employer
    funded.  The same is true of s. 57(4), which applies where a pension plan
    is wound up, since that has not yet happened in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    critical subsections are ss. 57(3) and 57(5).  They read as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)       An
    employer who is required to pay contributions to a pension fund shall be
    deemed to hold in trust for the beneficiaries of the pension plan an amount
    of money equal to the employer contributions due and not paid into the pension
    fund.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(5)       The
    administrator of the pension plan has a lien and charge on the assets of
    the employer in an amount equal to the amounts deemed to be held in trust
    under subsections (1), (3) and (4).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>BIA</i> sets
    out a scheme of priorities governing payment by creditors in the event of
    a bankruptcy. Section 67(1)(a) excludes from the bankrupt’s property any
    property held by the bankrupt in trust for another person. Then, in distributing
    the bankrupt’s estate, those meeting the definition of “secured creditor” in
    s. 2 of the <i>BIA</i> are paid first, generally on the basis that the earliest
    security is paid first.  Then, s. 136(1) sets out a list of other creditors
    who, subject to the rights of secured creditors, are to be preferred and
    paid in the priority listed in that subsection.  Finally, unsecured creditors
    share <i>pari passu</i> in what remains.  </p>

    is no doubt that once GCCL began to fall short of its required contributions

    the Administrator concedes that this section does not create a trust as contemplated
    by s. 67(1)(a) of the <i>BIA</i> and excludes nothing from the estate of
    GCCL for the purposes of distribution under the <i>BIA</i>. All parties to
    this appeal agree that that consequence is dictated by <i>British Columbia
    v. Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd.</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 24.  That case held that
    s. 67(1)(a) of the <i>BIA</i> does not apply to statutory deemed trusts that
    lack the common law attributes of a trust, such as the requirement that the
    property be kept separate and not commingled with the bankrupt’s own property.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Administrator’s argument, however, is simply that the lien and charge accorded
    to it by s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA </i>is separate from the deemed trust created
    by s. 57(3), and is effective for the purposes of the <i>BIA</i>, even if

    this argument to succeed, however, the first step is that, as holder of a
    s. 57(5) statutory lien, the Administrator must meet the definition of secured
    creditor in the <i>BIA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    that the Administrator is the person that administrates the pension plan.
    The Administrator is to ensure that the pension plan, and the pension fund
    maintained to provide benefits under the plan, are administered in accordance
    with the <i>PBA</i> and its regulations (s. 19(1)).  In doing so, the Administrator
    must exercise the care, diligence and skill that a person of ordinary prudence
    would exercise in dealing with the property of another person (s. 22(1)).  Section
    56(1) requires the Administrator to ensure that all contributions due under
    the pension plan are paid to the pension fund when due.  To facilitate this,
    the Administrator is given the right to commence legal proceedings to obtain
    payment of contributions due under the pension plan (s. 59).  </p>

    55(2) sets out the employer’s obligation to make contributions under a pension
    plan.  It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)       An
    employer required to make contributions under a pension plan, or a person
    or entity required to make contributions under a pension plan on behalf of

    manner and at the prescribed times,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       to
    the pension fund; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       if

style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>None
    of these provisions suggest that the contributions owed by GCCL are a debt
    due to the Administrator.  Rather, GCCL’s legal obligation was to make the
    contributions to the pension funds that were required under the pension plans.
    Nor is there even any indication that the contributions are owed to the Administrator
    to be held in trust for the pension funds.  Rather, the legislation contemplates
    that those contributions are owed to the pension funds pursuant to the pension
    plans, and are not the property of the Administrator.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Administrator’s right to commence legal proceedings simply permits it to

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    consequence of this is that the lien and charge accorded to the Administrator
    secures the employer’s obligation to pay the unpaid contributions required
    by the pension plans to the pension funds.  It does not secure a debt owed
    to the Administrator.  Hence s. 57(5) does not qualify the Administrator
    as a secured creditor for the purposes of the <i>BIA</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span

    conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the Administrator’s appeal, and makes
    it unnecessary to decide whether, if s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA</i> qualifies
    the Administrator as a secured creditor for the purposes of the <i>BIA</i>,
    that section is rendered inapplicable because its effect is to reorder the
    priorities for payment set out in the <i>BIA</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found that s. 57(5) has this effect.  Relying on <i>Husky Oil
    Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453,
    she held that s. 57(5) does not give the Administrator an enforceable lien
    under the <i>BIA</i>. As I have indicated, I need not address this issue.  Although
    it was not argued, my reluctance to do so is heightened because it does not
    appear that a notice of constitutional question was served, even though the
    issue squarely raises the constitutional applicability of s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA</i> in
    these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have said, the motion judge also decided that even if s. 57(5) of the <i>PBA</i> gives
    the Administrator a lien and charge that is effective for <i>BIA</i> purposes,
    the debt thus secured should be treated as having been fully discharged by
    the overpayments made in October and November 2004.  The motion judge reached
    that conclusion by applying the general principle in <i>Clayton’s Case</i> to
    treat these excess payments as being applied to the earliest arrears in GCCL’s
    required contributions, consequently eliminating the shortfall that existed
    on March 31, 2004. This would exhaust the effect of any priority the Administrator’s
    secured claim would have over Harbert’s secured claim because it arose before
    Harbert registered its security on March 31, 2004. Any secured claim by the
    Administrator for GCCL contributions required after that date but not paid
    would rank after Harbert’s secured interest.</p>

    my conclusion that the Administrator is not a secured creditor for <i>BIA </i>purposes,
    I need not address this issue either.  In any event, on the assumption she
    makes of constitutionality, I would not interfere with the motion judge’s
    conclusion.  In my view, it was open to her on the facts before her to adopt
    the evidentiary presumption suggested by the rule in <i>Clayton’s Case</i>.  Since
    there is no evidence from GCCL, the then administrator, concerning what indebtedness
    the overpayments in October and November 2004 were intended to apply to,
    and that the present Administrator was not in place when those overpayments
    were received or applied, I would conclude that the motion judge could properly
    resort to the default presumption suggested by the general principle.  Nor
    do I see any equitable basis for not doing so.  This is not a case where
    there is any suggestion that such a conclusion would reflect any attempt
    by GCCL to adversely affect pension plan members.</p>

  <h4>THE MOE APPEAL</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the root of the MOE opposition to the distribution ordered by the motion
    judge is one simple fact.  In manufacturing calcium chloride at its Amherstburg
    plant, GCCL produced by-products that were deposited in what was called the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Soda
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ash
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Settling
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Basin (“SASB”).  It is now a contaminated site and remedial costs could reach
    $64 million.  The MOE is anxious to see that GCCL assets are available to
    pay for this clean up.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    MOE has a number of regulatory tools to use to protect the environment.  In
    1997, it issued a Provisional Certificate of Approval to GCCL which <i>inter
    alia</i> required GCCL to provide for the closure of the SASB and assurance
    that the costs of the closure would be paid for by the company.  The latter
    was provided by a financial assurance that was subject to annual review by
    the MOE.  In March 2004, the MOE accepted $3.4 million as the appropriate
    amount required of GCCL.  Since then, the MOE has vastly increased its estimate
    of the cost of clean up, to as much as $64 million.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>CCAA</i> order
    stayed the MOE’s right to review and increase GCCL’s financial assurance.  In
    August 2005, the MOE sought the lifting of the stay to permit it to increase
    that amount, but it was unsuccessful.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    November 18, 2005 order appointing the interim receiver did not exempt either
    the receiver or GCCL from compliance with environmental regulations, nor
    did it prevent the MOE from issuing orders in respect of the SASB.  However,
    that order expressly excluded the SASB from the property of GCCL over which
    the interim receiver was appointed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is uncontested that Harbert’s security does not extend to the SASB.  Rather,
    it expressly excludes it.  Moreover, the MOE does not assert a security interest
    in GCCL’s operating assets over which Harbert does have security.  Section
    14.06(7) of the <i>BIA</i> does give the MOE a security interest in the bankruptcy
    in GCCL’s contaminated real property and any contiguous property related
    to the activity that caused the environmental damage. This security ranks
    above any other security against the same property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    it is the MOE’s position that the decision to distribute on an interim basis
    should be guided by what is fair and reasonable having regard to all stakeholders,
    akin to the considerations applied under the <i>CCAA</i>.  It argues that
    the “polluter pays” principle for environmental remediation requires no distribution
    until there can be an assurance that GCCL’s assets are sufficient to clean
    up the SASB.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found against the MOE and concluded that, in her discretion,
    the distribution should proceed.  She held that the MOE was an unsecured
    creditor in relation to the GCCL operating assets that generated the funds
    to be paid out, that to permit the MOE to effect a delay in distribution
    would be to give it a <i>quasi</i> priority over other unsecured creditors,
    and in any event it has security over the SASB.  She also found no evidence
    of any imminent environmental effects or any non-compliance by GCCL with
    any environmental regulations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, the MOE repeats its arguments below and raises, as it did there,
    the case of <i>Panamericana De Bienes Y Servicios (Receiver of) v. Northern
    Badger Oil and Gas Ltd. </i>(1991), 81 D.L.R. (4th) 280 (Alta. C.A.).  In
    that case, the court found that provincial environmental legislation concerning
    oilwell clean up costs did not conflict with the scheme of distribution under
    the <i>BIA</i>, and had to be complied with even though that reduced the
    amounts otherwise available for distribution in the bankruptcy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the reasoning in that case has been overtaken
    because of subsequent amendments to the <i>BIA</i>.  Section 14.06(7) now
    expressly provides for priority to be accorded to environmental clean up
    costs and s. 14.06(8) now ensures that a claim against the debtor for environmental
    clean up costs is a provable claim.  Neither were in effect at the time of <i>Panamericana</i>.  To
    give effect to provincial environmental legislation in the face of these
    amendments to the <i>BIA</i> would impermissibly affect the scheme of priorities
    in the federal legislation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Beyond
    that, I see no basis to interfere with the discretion of the motion judge
    to order the interim distribution.  Harbert is the only creditor secured
    against the GCCL operating assets that generated the funds for distribution.  In
    that regard, the MOE is an unsecured creditor. The MOE does, however, have
    security against GCCL’s real property, as provided by the <i>BIA</i>. Harbert’s
    security does not extend to the SASB, nor does the interim receiver have
    possession of that real property. The motion judge found no evidence of non-compliance
    with environmental orders nor any threat of imminent environmental harm.  In
    these circumstances, I see nothing unreasonable in the interim distribution
    going forward.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    the Administrator nor Harbert sought costs.  While the receiver sought costs
    against the MOE, the latter neither sought costs nor invited an adverse costs
    award.  In the circumstances, I would order no costs to any party.</p>
