'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from a non-party costs award made against Dougall Grange and
    Peter Currie, the directors of the St. James’
    Preservation Society (“the Society”).  After a one and a half day application
    brought by the Society (also referred to in these reasons as the applicant),
    the application judge ordered costs in the amount of $105,852.14 to be paid
    personally by Grange and Currie. He concluded that the Society was almost
    wholly unsuccessful on the application, and that the litigation was not sufficiently
    in the public interest to justify a departure from the usual costs rules.  The
    Society took no appeal from his decision on the application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ principal submissions are that the application judge erred in
    his conclusion that the litigation was not sufficiently in the public interest
    and further submit that he deprived them of procedural fairness in making
    the personal costs award against them that he did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the application judge went too far in concluding that the Society
    had no success on the application.  A declaration was necessary to restore
    actual notice to the public record that the residue of property, known as
    Parcel F, was trust property. As the respondent would not consent to the
    making of a declaration, bringing the application for a declaration was a
    precondition of actual notice being restored. That said, the application
    judge was clearly of the opinion that any success the Society achieved was
    outweighed by the time and expense of the litigation and by its lack of success
    on many other issues it raised.  Overall, he was of the opinion the litigation
    was not in the public interest. While I may not have come to the same conclusion,
    I am not prepared to say that he committed an overriding error in this regard.  However,
    in deciding whether to award costs personally against the appellants, the
    application judge is clear in his reasons that he accepted:</p>

      issue was novel insofar as no previous court had interpreted the precise

      application involved issues that extended beyond the immediate parties
      involved.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>These factors take the litigation
    out of the realm of an abuse of process, one of the bases on which courts
    have in the past awarded costs personally against individuals.  It is equally
    clear that the appellants did not stand to gain personally from the litigation.
    The cumulative effect of these factors, when considered with the fact the
    R &amp; C did not seek to make the appellants parties to the application,
    and the lack of a full hearing as to whether the appellants should be personally
    liable for costs in the face of affidavit evidence that other reputable persons
    supported the Society, leads me to conclude that the application judge erred
    in holding that the exceptional circumstances existed for awarding costs
    against the appellants personally.   Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.
    My reasons are set out in detail below. </p>

    1820, the trustees surrendered that patent and a new patent was issued which

    respondent, the Rector and Churchwardens of St. James’ Cathedral (“R&amp;C”),
    is a corporation that holds title to the land on which the cathedral sits
    as trustee. On January 17, 2000, the R&amp;C conveyed Parcel F to itself
    without stipulating that it was a trustee or referring to the trust or its
    terms.  On June 7, 2000, the R&amp;C entered into a non-binding letter of
    intent with Context Real Estate Inc. (“Context”) to sell Parcel F for $7.5
    million. Context sought to build a condominium tower on the land. The termination
    date of the non-binding letter of intent was extended to April 30, 2001,
    an extension that subsequently lapsed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons that the parties dispute, the respondent began to consider options
    other than the development of the cathedral land. In 2002 R&amp;C entered
    into an agreement with the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto and Context to transfer some of the zoning density from the church
    lands to Context’s nearby condominium property. R&amp;C received $3.7 million
    from the developer for the density transfer and intended to use the funds
    to restore church buildings on the property. This transaction was approved
    at a meeting of the cathedral’s parishioners on May 26, 2002. On September
    16, 2003, a further meeting of parishioners approved a re-zoning agreement
    which required R&amp;C to enter into two separate agreements with the City:
    a Heritage Easement Agreement and a “Section 37 agreement” pursuant to section
    37 of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    heritage easement agreement designated certain parts of the Parish House
    and Diocesan Centre on the land as having heritage value and prohibited changes
    to these buildings. The agreement also required that the church use the funds
    received from the re-zoning to refurbish the property within certain time
    limits. It stipulated certain aspects of the refurbishment and prohibited
    the church from otherwise altering the footprints of the existing buildings.
    The section 37 agreement required that at least $2.7 million of the funds
    received from the re-zoning be paid into a trust account, and required the
    church to provide a quarterly accounting to the city reporting on how funds
    had been used. It prohibited use of the funds except for “the purpose of
    financing the revitalization, conservation, restoration and/or improvement
    of the Parish House and Diocesan Centre of St. James’ Cathedral and associated
    landscape features on the St. James’ land.”   </p>

'><span>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the lead up to these agreements, the Society and the appellants participated
    in several parishioner meetings in an attempt to thwart the rezoning and
    made further unsuccessful representations to City Council and the Ontario
    Municipal Board. On February 25, 2005, the OMB dismissed the Society’s appeal
    of its decision to pass the bylaws. </p>

    City of
    <st1:City

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto and the R&amp;C. It sought orders quashing the zoning bylaws on the
    ground that the density transfer violated the terms of the trust. It also
    sought declaratory relief with respect to the terms of the trust, the proper
    use of the land, and the proper use of funds raised by the density transfer.
    After the Society commenced the application, the parties entered into a partial
    settlement agreement pursuant to which the Society retracted its attack on
    the bylaws, discontinued the application against the city, and limited the
    relief that it sought to specifically enumerated issues. The $3.7 million
    was paid into court. </p>

    these grounds and a number of additional grounds that were not included in
    the relief that it had restricted itself to seeking in the partial settlement
    agreement. R&amp;C’s position was that the appellant was precluded from raising
    these additional issues because they had been abandoned. The application
    judge agreed that the Society should be bound by the agreement and precluded
    it from raising these issues. Alternatively, the application judge gave reasons

    respect to the issues that the Society had raised in the Amended Notice of
    Application, the application judge found that the monies R&amp;C received
    from the density transfer were impressed with a trust.  Importantly, at the
    hearing the respondent had admitted that the monies were impressed with a
    trust but had contested a declaration consistent with this admission. The
    application judge ruled that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Given
      the agreement of the parties with respect to the fact of a trust, it is
      not clear why this aspect of the application has not been settled. It is
      equally unclear why the respondent resists a declaration consistent with
      their admission. However, in the absence of a settlement between the parties
      or a binding undertaking with respect to this issue, it is clear that the
      matter is not moot. Therefore, it is appropriate that the court address
      this issue and, in light of the agreement of the parties, it is appropriate
      to declare that the monies are impressed with a trust in the Crown patents
      as that trust has been revised from time to time by statute.</span></p>

    Toronto, as the City of

    insofar as it related to the Society’s standing to bring the application.
    It did not contest standing and argued that the application judge should
    refuse to define the beneficiaries without knowing exactly why the question
    required a determination and without a concrete set of underlying facts.  </p>

    which would require that every use of the monies must benefit both parishioners <i>and </i>inhabitants.
    The application judge rejected the respondent’s argument that the issue of
    whether the monies were impressed with a trust was moot because the trust
    was admitted. He explained: </p>

    Society argued that it should be awarded costs because the Society was successful
    in its principal claim of relief – the declaration that the proceeds of the
    density transfer were impressed with a trust. The Society’s alternative position
    was that each party should bear its own costs, given the fact that the application
    was brought in the public interest and in light of the respondent’s success
    as to whether trust funds could be used to refurbish the Diocesan Centre.  With
    respect to a personal award of costs, the Society argued that this was not
    an appropriate case for such an exceptional order because the Society was

    Diocesan Centre.”
    He noted that he had rejected the Society’s interpretation of the trust and

    respect to the first factor, the nature of the unsuccessful litigant, the
    application judge accepted that the Society was not acting to vindicate a
    private interest and did have a subjective belief in the issues raised. Further,
    he concluded that the Society had a genuine interest in this litigation and
    that there were no other potential litigants who were better suited to have
    brought this application.  </p>

    discussing the nature of the <i>lis</i>, the application judge acknowledged
    that this application involved issues that extended beyond the immediate
    parties to the litigation and also involved a new issue, insofar as no previous
    court decision had interpreted the precise scope of the provisions of this
    trust.  That said, however, he concluded that the application was not in
    the public interest because many of the arguments advanced were totally devoid
    of merit and the Society had improperly tried to re-litigate matters that
    it had already settled by way of the partial settlement agreement. </p>

'><span>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    he reasoned that the fact that the impugned density transfer had been agreed
    to by both the Church and the municipal government of Toronto in the context
    of
    “open, democratic and responsible decision-making processes” militated against
    the finding that the application was in the public interest, as the appellant
    “appears to represent no one but its three directors” and participated in
    these processes but refused to accept their outcomes. Finally, the application
    judge concluded that there was no practical need to bring this application
    because the respondent acknowledged that the funds were impressed with a

    application judge found that the application did have an adverse impact on
    the public interest because the respondent was forced to expend considerable
    funds in defending it that could have been used by the Church in various
    ways that would have benefited the public interest. With respect to the financial
    consequences of a cost order to the parties, he was satisfied that requiring
    the R&amp;C to pay their own costs would have an adverse impact on the public
    interest.  While requiring the Society to pay costs would bankrupt it, this
    was no reason to refuse a costs order, especially because it was incorporated
    with a view to this litigation and had no prior history of public interest
    activity. </p>

    accepted that such an order should only be made in exceptional circumstances.
    In order to obtain such an order, he noted that the respondents must demonstrate:
    (a) that the directors had status to bring the application against the R &amp; C

    were the “true applicant”, noting that there was no evidence that the Society
    had any other members or that it represented anyone beyond them. He was clear
    that Grange and Currie controlled the conduct of the litigation from its
    inception, attended all meetings in relation to the application, including

    submit that if costs were to be sought against them personally they should
    have been made parties to the litigation. See <i>Ratepayers of

    Calgary (City) supra </i>at para 10.<i> </i> Had R&amp;C sought to make Grange
    and Currie parties they would have been afforded all of the protections of
    parties, including the ability to be awarded costs instead of just being
    subject to an order to pay them, and they further submit their litigation
    strategy may have been different. </p>

    R
    &amp; C’s position is that Grange and Currie knew they were at risk to have
    costs awarded against them personally and there has been no denial of procedural
    fairness. Actual notice was given to the appellant that the R&amp;C would
    seek personal costs against the directors in correspondence attached to a
    September 24, 2004 settlement offer, which mentioned that “if this settlement
    offer is not accepted, the Church will ask the court hearing this application
    to award costs in favour of the Church against Dougall Grange, Peter Currie
    and Melissa Moshenko personally.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    letter was sent less than two months before the hearing and until that point
    the issue of a personal costs order had not arisen in this litigation.  Further,
    it is not uncommon for correspondence and offers to contain a threat that
    costs will be sought personally.  Had the R &amp; C brought a motion for
    security for costs in advance of the application being heard, the issue of
    Grange and Currie’s personal liability could have been raised at that time.  No
    such motion was brought.</p>

'><span>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court clearly has authority, derived from its inherent jurisdiction to prevent
    an abuse of process, to award costs against a non-party who has proved to
    be the real person controlling the litigation but has put forward a “man
    of straw” to avoid liability for costs or other reasons: <i>Alexanian v.
    Dolinski</i> (1973), 2 O.R. (2d) 609 (C.A.); <i>Re Sturmer and Town of Beaverton </i>(1912),
    25 O.L.R. 566 (C.A.). The making of such an order is, however, exceptional. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are important distinctions between the authorities on which the R &amp; C
    relies in support of a personal costs award being made and the present case.  For
    example, <i>Sturmer v.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Beaverton (Town), </i>(1911) 20 O.W.R. 560, (H.C.J.),<i> </i>(1912), 21 O.W.R.
    390 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), involved a situation where the court found there was an abuse of process.
    In <i>Smith v. Canadian Tire Acceptance Ltd. </i>(1995) 22 O.R. (3d) Gen
    Div. affirmed (1995), 40 C.P.C. (3d) 129, the litigant stood to gain personally.
    Neither situation exists here.</p>

'><span>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    in making his order, the application judge found that there was “no evidence
    that the Society has any other members or that it represents anyone beyond
    the first three directors.”  There was affidavit evidence that related to
    this issue on the record from William Cooke, a parishioner and former archivist
    of St. James’ Cathedral and from Jane Beecroft, a member of the Community
    History Project. While neither Cooke nor Beecroft mentioned being members
    of the Society, both explained how their research on St. James’ Cathedral
    had caused them to doubt whether the R&amp;C had any legal rights to develop
    or re-develop the land in question. Cooke’s evidence also expressed his opinion
    for the need for a judicial determination of this issue. My only comment
    on this issue is that the application judge would have been in a better position
    to determine whether the Society was a sham after he had presided over a
    full hearing on the costs issue. </p>

'><span>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without
    subscribing to the submission that it is always necessary for an individual
    to be made a third party to an action if costs are going to be sought against
    the individual personally, I would hold that the individual members of the
    Society did not receive adequate warning in this case that costs would be
    sought against them personally and, further, that the exceptional circumstances
    do not exist for a costs award to be made personally against them. </p>

    the appellant seeks to admit fresh evidence on this appeal that it submits
    is probative of the fact that, the respondent’s admission of a trust when
    the application was heard, ran counter to its dealings with the property
    in the context of its potential development and in related litigation.  It
    submits that this evidence would have caused the application judge to reconsider
    his finding that there was no practical need to bring this application.  The
    proffered evidence does not satisfy the <i>Palmer</i> test for the admission
    of fresh evidence on appeal and I would not admit it.</p>
