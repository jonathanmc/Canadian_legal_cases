    June 5, 2007, this court released its reasons for decision in this matter
    in which it allowed the appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal.  As explained
    in those reasons, this court held that neither Kerry nor the Committee was
    entitled to costs of the initial proceedings before the Tribunal.  However,
    the parties were invited to make written submissions on what party or parties
    were entitled to costs of the appeals to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court and to this court, from what source or sources, and on what
    scale.  After considering those submissions, I would make the following orders
    in respect of costs.       </p>

    Divisional Court ordered Kerry to pay costs to the Committee, on a partial
    indemnity basis, of $90,000 plus disbursements and GST, for the two appeals
    that it heard and decided.  Given Kerry’s success on the appeal and cross-appeal
    to this court, I would set aside the

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s costs order and award Kerry costs of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court appeals on a partial indemnity basis.  The fact that a number
    of the issues were novel and important and that their resolution benefitted
    the broader pension community augurs in favour of a modest award.  Accordingly,
    I would fix those costs at $45,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  As
    I explain below, in my view, those costs are properly payable by the Committee,
    rather than from the pension fund (the “Fund”).   </p>

    or cross-appeal that warrants costs being awarded on a substantial indemnity
    basis.  Thus, I would further order that the Committee pay Kerry’s costs
    of the appeal and cross-appeal.  For the reasons given below, I would fix
    those costs at $40,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.   </p>

    Fund.  However, when determining whether to exercise that power, I begin
    from the proposition that there is no special rule or presumption applicable
    to pension cases that entitles plan members to have pension litigation financed
    by the pension fund.  This view is informed by the fact that there is a regulatory
    system in place that provides pension plan members with the opportunity to
    have concerns investigated with little risk that costs will be ordered against
    them.  As I understand it, a request that the Superintendent examine a matter
    attracts no risk of a costs sanction.  And, costs at the Tribunal level are
    not generally imposed absent “clearly unreasonable, frivolous or vexatious” behaviour
    by a party (see <i>Financial Services Tribunal Practice Direction on Costs
    Awards </i>(August 1, 2004)).  In the present case, both the Superintendent
    of Financial Services and the Financial Services Tribunal scrutinized Kerry’s
    impugned actions with no costs awards being made against any party.</p>

    determining whether to order the Committee’s costs from the Fund, guidance
    can be taken from the approach followed in trusts litigation.  That approach
    was well&#8209;summarised by Cullity J. in <i>Sutherland v. Hudson’s Bay
    Co. Ltd.</i>, [2006] O. J. No. 2009 (S.C.J.) at para. 11:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Orders for the payment of costs out of trust funds
    are most commonly made in either of two cases.  One is where the rights of
    the unsuccessful parties to funds held in trust are not clearly and unambiguously
    dealt with in the terms of the trust instrument.  In such cases, the order
    is sometimes justified by describing the problem as one created by the testator
    or settler who transferred the funds to the trust.  The other case is where
    the claim of the unsuccessful party may reasonably be considered to have
    been advanced for the benefit of all of the persons beneficially interested
    in the trust fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    determining whether to award costs from a pension fund, courts in other jurisdictions<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> have relied on the following passage from <i>Re
    Buckton</i>, [1907] 2 Ch. 406 at 414 - 415:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In a large proportion of the summonses adjourned
    into Court for argument the applicants are trustees of a will or settlement
    who ask the Court to construe the instrument of trust for their guidance,
    and in order to ascertain the interests of beneficiaries, or else ask to
    have some question determined which has arisen in the administration of the
    trusts. In cases of this character I regard the costs of all parties as necessarily
    incurred for the benefit of the estate, and direct them to be taxed as between
    solicitor and client and paid out of the estate. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is a second class of cases differing in form,
    but not in substance from the first. In these cases it is admitted on all
    hands, or it is apparent from the proceedings that although the application
    is made, not by trustees (who are respondents), but by some of the beneficiaries,
    yet it is made by reason of some difficulty of construction, or administration,
    which would have justified an application by the trustees, and it is not
    made by them only because, for some reason or other, a different course has
    been deemed more convenient. To this class I extend the operation of the
    same rule as is observed in cases of the first class.  The application is
    necessary for the administration of the trust, and the costs of all parties
    are necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate regarded as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is yet a third class of cases differing in
    form and substance from the first, and in substance, though not in form,
    from the second.  In this class the application is made by a beneficiary
    who makes a claim adverse to other beneficiaries and really takes advantage
    of the convenient procedure by originating summons to get a question determined
    which, but for this procedure, would be the subject of an action commenced
    by writ, and would strictly fall within the description of litigation. It
    is often difficult to discriminate between cases of the second and third
    classes, but when once<i> </i>convinced that I am determining rights between
    adverse litigants I apply the rule which ought, I think, to be rigidly enforced
    in adverse litigation and order the unsuccessful party to pay the costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    a number of reasons, I favour the approach articulated by Cullity J. (which
    I will refer to as the “pension trust approach”).  I do not find the categories
    set out in <i>Buckton </i>to be particularly helpful in the pension trust
    context.  There is significant overlap in the first two categories in <i>Buckton</i>.  Both
    categories are based on the same public policy consideration, namely, that
    it is desirable that parties have access to the courts to ensure that trusts
    are properly administered.  The only difference between the first two <i>Buckton </i>categories
    is in who brings the matter to court.  In category one, the proceedings are
    brought by the trustee whereas in category two, they are brought by the beneficiaries.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore,
    the third category in <i>Buckton</i> is problematic when dealing with pension
    trusts.  To determine whether a matter falls within the third <i>Buckton </i>category,
    the court must decide whether the claims that have been advanced are adverse
    to other beneficiaries.  While that determination is usefully made when considering
    traditional trusts, it is often irrelevant in pension trusts where there
    are numerous categories of beneficiaries, many with conflicting interests.  For
    example, in a merged plan, one group of beneficiaries may claim full surplus
    entitlement based on historical plan language.  Their claim is adverse to
    those of other classes of beneficiaries, such as those made by new employees
    or by employees who have been “imported” from the merging plan.  But, if
    an issue arises as to the proper distribution of surplus, costs are properly
    payable from the trust fund as public policy dictates that the issue of entitlement
    be resolved before the trust fund is distributed.  The fact that the interests
    of one group of beneficiaries is adverse to those of other groups is irrelevant.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    contrast, the two categories set out in the pension trust approach reflect
    different public policy reasons for granting costs from the trust fund.  The
    first category reflects the public interest in ensuring that all trust funds,
    including those in which pension monies are held, are properly administered.  If
    there is ambiguity about the rights of beneficiaries, those administering
    the pension fund are to be encouraged to bring the matter to the courts for
    direction so that when they perform, they do so in accordance with the law.  By
    awarding costs from the pension trust fund, there is no penalty or disincentive
    to seeking such direction.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    same public policy interest exists when direction is sought by the beneficiaries
    in pursuance of their right to compel due administration of the trust.  To
    be meaningful, beneficiaries must be able to exercise that right without
    risk of costs consequences, so long as they act reasonably.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second category of court proceedings referred to in the pension trust approach
    are those proceedings taken for the benefit of all of the beneficiaries.  As
    all beneficiaries stand to reap the benefits of such a proceeding, an award
    of costs from the trust fund is fair as all beneficiaries bear the cost of
    the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the pension trust approach, unless a court proceeding fits within one of
    those two categories, the usual civil litigation costs rules ought to apply.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Using
    that approach, I now consider the Committee’s claims.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    will be recalled that the first category in the pension trust approach is
    litigation that is necessary to ensure that a trust is properly administered.  Typically,
    the litigation is required to determine the rights of beneficiaries and arises
    as a result of ambiguity in the trust documents.  </p>

    a general level, the present case could be said to be aimed at ensuring that
    the Fund was properly administered.  And, clearly, interpretation of the
    pension and trust documents was essential to resolving this case.  However,
    this litigation was not directed at having the courts determine the rights
    of beneficiaries.  Compare it to the surplus cases – a classic example of
    pension litigation.  Unlike the surplus cases, in which the courts’ interpretation
    of plan documents is necessary to determine the rights of beneficiaries,
    this litigation arose because of the Committee’s claim that Kerry was improperly
    administering the Fund by paying Plan expenses from it and taking contribution
    holidays in respect of the Part 2 members.  This litigation was not about
    beneficiaries’ rights; it was about the propriety of actions taken by those
    responsible for the administration of the Fund and its aim was to force the
    employer to make payments into the Fund to the benefit of a limited group.  In
    my view, the claims advanced were adversarial in nature; they were not directed
    at the interpretation of documents to ascertain beneficiaries’ rights.    </p>

    so concluding, I note that certain members of the Committee made the very
    decisions that were attacked in these proceedings.  The record shows that
    those members had been senior members of the management team which had overall
    responsibility for administering the Plan.  When the management team made
    the decisions to take contribution holidays and pay plan expenses from the
    Fund, it did so with the benefit of appropriate legal and actuarial advice
    and with the belief that the decisions were properly made.  It was open to
    management to have applied to the court for advice and directions at the
    time such actions were being contemplated, had there been serious concern
    about the legality of such actions.  </p>

    comments are not intended to suggest that costs ought never to be awarded
    from a trust fund in “after-the-fact”
    proceedings.  Nor are they intended as a criticism of any members of the
    Committee.  I make these observations to assist in explaining why I see the
    proceedings as adversarial rather than as being directed at the due administration
    of the Fund.         </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    litigation is adversarial or directed at the due administration of a trust
    is critical in deciding whether to order costs from the trust fund because,
    where the matters in issue are truly administrative, there is no unfairness
    in ordering costs from the pension fund.  Costs in those circumstances are
    a legitimate expense of ensuring that the fund is properly administered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the litigation is adversarial, however, there is an inherent unfairness in
    ordering costs from the Fund because it results in less money being in the
    Fund and, therefore, available for the benefit of all plan members.  That
    unfairness is compounded in the present case because the pension plan is
    ongoing.  As the employer and plan sponsor, Kerry is responsible for the
    Fund’s solvency.  If costs are paid from the Fund, Kerry may be required
    to contribute more in future than it might otherwise have been required to
    pay.  If that occurred, Kerry, the successful litigant, would be paying the
    costs of the unsuccessful litigants.  That does not accord with our basic
    notions of fairness in the adversarial litigation process.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second category of cases in which costs are awarded from a trust fund is
    where the claims can reasonably be considered to have been advanced for the
    benefit of those beneficially interested in the trust.  In my view, the Committee’s
    claims do not fall within this category either.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    considerations lead me to this conclusion.  First, the Committee did not
    bring the proceedings on behalf of all of the Fund beneficiaries.  Indeed,
    as discussed in the reasons for decision, there is no evidence of the level
    of support that the Committee had from the Plan membership.  Further, the
    central thrust of the Committee’s position throughout the litigation was
    that a second pension plan and fund had been established.  Had the Committee
    been successful, Kerry would have been required to pay money into the original
    fund which, on the Committee’s view, was to be held for the benefit of a
    particular class of plan beneficiaries, namely, the Part 1 members.  Thus,
    contrary to the Committee’s contention, its claims were not brought for the
    benefit of all those beneficially interested in the Fund.        </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the Committee’s claims do not fall within either category, I would apply
    the usual costs rules in respect of civil litigation and order the Committee
    to pay Kerry its costs on a partial indemnity basis.  In determining the
    quantum, I again note that a number of the issues were novel and important
    and that resolution benefitted the broader pension community.  A competing
    consideration, however, is that the proceedings were protracted by virtue
    of the position the Committee took on the cross-appeal.  The law governing
    the contribution holiday issue raised on the cross-appeal was well-known.  Its
    application was straightforward and acknowledged as such by the Tribunal
    and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  While the Committee was entitled to pursue that issue,
    the reasonableness of its position on all issues is a factor that must be
    taken into consideration.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    balancing all of the relevant considerations, in my view, awarding costs
    Kerry of the appeal and cross-appeal, fixed at $40,000, all inclusive, is
    fair and reasonable.       </p>
