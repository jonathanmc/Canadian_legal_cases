  <h2>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, James Anthony, was convicted of the first degree murder of Cynthia
    Jamieson.  Mr. Anthony met Ms. Jamieson in a bar in the spring of 2002.  After
    they each drank a few glasses of beer, they returned to Mr. Anthony’s apartment
    and had sex.  In his statement to the police and medical personnel, Mr. Anthony
    described the sex as “kinky”.  He said that he thrust his fist into Ms. Jamieson’s
    vagina and anus.  Afterwards, Mr. Anthony went to sleep.  When he awoke he
    found large amounts of blood and fecal matter around her.  Several hours
    later, at a friend’s suggestion, he called 9-1-1.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Jamieson bled to death from massive internal injuries.  The experts testified
    that Mr. Anthony’s fist thrusts would have caused excruciating pain and that
    no one could have tolerated or consented to that level of injury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Anthony was charged with first degree murder under s. 231(5)(b) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>:
    causing Ms. Jamieson’s death while committing a sexual assault.  He was tried
    before Whitten J. and a jury.  He denied that he had sexually assaulted Ms.
    Jamieson; he said that she consented to the sexual activity or that he mistakenly
    believed that she had consented.  He also claimed that he did not intentionally
    cause Ms. Jamieson’s death; rather, he said that her death was accidental.  Finally,
    he said that he was too drunk to have the intent for murder.  He did not
    testify at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury found Mr. Anthony guilty of first degree murder.  The trial judge sentenced
    him to the mandatory term of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole
    for twenty-five years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, Mr. Anthony argued that the trial judge made four errors of law:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1.        He erred by admitting into evidence a statement Mr. Anthony made
    to a police officer at the scene;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>2.        He erred by failing to relate the defence of accident to the question
    whether Mr. Anthony had the required <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for murder;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>3.        He erred by failing to direct the jury that they could not use the
    evidence of Mr. Anthony’s post-offence conduct to help them determine whether
    he was guilty of murder or manslaughter; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>4.        He
    erred by instructing the jury that sexual arousal could cause the required <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for
    murder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    called on the Crown on arguments two and three.  I would not give effect
    to Mr. Anthony’s first, second, or fourth argument but I agree with his third.  However,
    the trial judge’s non-direction on Mr. Anthony’s post-offence conduct did
    not deprive him of a fair trial.  I would therefore dismiss his appeal.</p>
  <h2>B.        ANALYSIS </h2>
  <h2>1.        The Admissibility of Mr. Anthony’s Statement to the Police Officer
    at the Scene</h2>
  <h2>            (a)       Mr. Anthony’s position</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial Mr. Anthony challenged the admissibility of three statements that he
    made to the police: a statement he gave to Officer Chu at the scene; a statement
    he gave later the same day at the police station; and a statement he gave
    the next day after he had been arrested.  He challenged these statements
    on two grounds: before he made them the police did not advise him of his
    right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, and he did not make
    the statements voluntarily. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge excluded the second and third statements but admitted Mr. Anthony's
    first statement made at the scene.  In a thorough and well reasoned decision,
    the trial judge ruled that when Mr. Anthony gave a statement to Officer Chu
    at the scene he was not detained under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, and
    he was not a suspect so his statement was voluntary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, Mr. Anthony contends that the trial judge’s ruling was incorrect
    on any one of three grounds:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in holding that Mr. Anthony was not detained and therefore
    that the police did not need to advise him of his right to counsel;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in holding that Mr. Anthony was not a suspect at the time
    and therefore that the police did not need to advise him of his right to
    silence; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in failing to exclude or at least edit the statement on
    the ground that its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative
    value.</p>
  <h2>            (b)       Mr. Anthony’s statement and the circumstances under
    which he gave it</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> into the admissibility of the three statements,
    Officer Chu testified that he arrived at the scene just after noon.  He spoke
    to another officer who believed that they were responding to a “sudden death” under “suspicious
    circumstances”.  The other officer told Officer Chu to get a statement from
    Mr. Anthony.  They discussed whether to caution Mr. Anthony and decided not
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Officer
    Chu went into the apartment and saw the victim lying nude with a lot of blood
    around her hips.  He believed that foul play was a possibility, and that
    the situation appeared a “little suspicious”.  However, he did not have reasonable
    grounds to believe an offence had been committed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Officer
    Chu approached Mr. Anthony and said that they “needed” to take a statement
    from him.  The two men walked to the police cruiser.  Mr. Anthony asked to
    sit in the front seat but Officer Chu asked him to sit in the back of the
    cruiser.  Officer Chu again said that the police
    “needed” Mr. Anthony’s help.  He did not caution Mr. Anthony about his right
    to counsel or his right to silence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary
    to his other statements, in his statement to Officer Chu, Mr. Anthony disclosed
    that he had “normal sex” twice with Ms. Jamieson when she was either unconscious
    or dead.  He said that after he penetrated her with his fist, “I went and
    washed my hands.  I came back and I had normal sex.  We fucked until the
    wee hours of the morning.”  He then told Officer Chu that much later in the
    morning after he woke up he got angry with Ms. Jamieson: “She would not wake
    up.  I figured she was passed out drunk.  I went back into bed with her and
    had normal sex.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Anthony did not testify during the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>.  I turn to his
    three contentions, and begin with the last one in order to address the relevance
    of his statement.</p>
  <h2>(c)       The probative value of Mr. Anthony’s statement </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, Mr. Anthony did not argue the prejudicial effect of admitting into
    evidence his statement to Officer Chu.  Nor did he ask the trial judge to
    edit the statement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, he submits that the statement was prejudicial because having
    intercourse with an unconscious or dead person would repel the jury.  Even
    accepting that to be so, Mr. Anthony’s statement potentially had strong probative
    value on the question of first degree murder and should not be excluded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    prove Mr. Anthony guilty of first degree murder, the Crown had to prove two
    elements beyond a reasonable doubt.  The first was that Mr. Anthony caused
    Ms. Jamieson’s death while sexually assaulting her.  The second was that
    this sexual assault was part of the same “continuous transaction” as the
    unlawful acts that caused her death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first element, Mr. Anthony never conceded that “fisting” Ms. Jamieson
    amounted to a sexual assault; he relied on the defences of consent and mistaken
    believe in consent.  If the jury had accepted either defence then Mr. Anthony’s
    later sexual acts, which he disclosed to Officer Chu, would be highly relevant.  As
    Ms. Jamieson was not conscious during either of these acts, Mr. Anthony could
    not rely on consent or honest but mistaken belief in consent.  These later
    two acts therefore amounted to sexual assaults.  In this context, Mr. Anthony’s
    statement would be highly probative on the question whether Mr. Anthony caused
    Ms. Jamieson’s death while sexually assaulting her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in order to raise Mr. Anthony’s culpability to first degree murder, the jury
    would still have to be satisfied on the second element: that these sexual
    acts were part of the same “continuous transaction” as the unlawful acts
    that caused her death.  Both counsel agreed that the jury should decide whether
    there was a single continuous transaction.  Once again, if the jury had accepted
    Mr. Anthony’s defence concerning the “fisting”, they would have had to decide
    whether the sexual acts he performed on Ms. Jamieson’s unconscious or dead
    body were part of the same “continuous transaction” as the unlawful acts
    that caused her death.  In resolving this question, Mr. Anthony’s statement
    to Officer Chu would be highly probative.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these brief reasons, I conclude that the probative value of Mr. Anthony’s
    statement to Officer Chu outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>
  <h2>(d)       Mr. Anthony was not detained when he gave a statement to Officer
    Chu </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    Mr. Anthony was detained when he gave his statement to Officer Chu, he was
    entitled to be advised of his right to counsel.  The trial judge ruled that
    he was not detained.  That ruling was well supported by the evidence on the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>,
    and I see no basis to interfere with it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the heart of a detention – in this case an alleged psychological detention – is
    compulsion.  An individual acquiesces to a demand by the police because the
    individual reasonably believes there is no choice but to comply: <i>R. v.
    Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Thomsen</i> (1988),
    40 C.C.C. (3d) 411 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    Officer Chu’s interview of Mr. Anthony, the trial judge found no compulsion.  The
    following evidence reasonably supports his finding:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge characterized Officer Chu’s
    “need” for a statement as a request, not a demand.  This characterization
    was reasonable.  As the trial judge held, this request was not
    “imbued with the psychological compulsion that the courts are vigilant for.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Officer
    Chu interviewed Mr. Anthony for over an hour, but his questions did not contribute

    and those he asked were mainly “tell me what happened.”  Mr. Anthony was
    eager to tell his story.  Officer Chu listened and took notes.</p>

    location for the interview did not create an atmosphere of oppression or

    and privacy.  Although the door was closed, Mr. Anthony was allowed to leave,

    trial judge focussed his voluntariness ruling on whether Mr. Anthony was
    a “suspect” at the time because that was the principal issue argued before
    him.  Relying on <i>R. v. Dalzell</i>,<i> </i>[2003] O.J. No. 4901 (S.C.J.), <i>R.
    v. Worrall, </i>[2002] O.J. No. 2711 (S.C.J.), and <i>R. v. Morrison</i>,<i> </i>[2000]
    O.J. No. 5733 (S.C.J.), the trial judge found that a caution about the right
    to silence assists the court in determining whether a statement given by
    a
    “suspect” was made voluntarily.  In this case, the trial judge found that
    Mr. Anthony was not a suspect at the time, did not need a caution about his
    right to silence, and gave his statement voluntarily.  I see no basis to
    interfere with this finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge summarized his findings that Mr. Anthony was not a suspect when
    Officer Chu interviewed him in the following part of his ruling:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>His narrative was that of a couple, not known to each other, becoming friendly,
    intimate, and having possible unconventional sex.  The woman was described
    as haemorrhaging and in essence is progressively described by Mr. Anthony
    the morning after to be vital signs absent.  This is not a narrative of a
    crime.  There is no unlawful death as such.  It is an unexplained death possibly
    in suspicious circumstances, and it is treated as such by Officer Hrab.  It
    is a narrative which requires an expert opinion as to a cause of death before
    it can be considered a crime.  It cannot be said that Mr. Anthony was a suspect
    throughout the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chu interview and, therefore, in need of a caution as to the right to silence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    statement to Officer Chu voluntarily.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, Mr. Anthony contends that the trial judge erred in this conclusion.
    He compares the trial judge’s finding on his statement to Officer Chu with
    the trial judge’s finding on his statement later that day at the police station.  Although
    Mr. Anthony was not cautioned about his right to silence before either statement,
    the trial judge found that the statement made at the scene was voluntary
    and the statement made at the station was not.  Mr. Anthony submits that
    these two findings are inconsistent because the police had the same information
    when they conducted both interviews.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree with Mr. Anthony’s submission.  The trial judge held that Mr. Anthony’s
    statement at the station was involuntary because Mr. Anthony was being “treated
    like a suspect”.  Mr. Anthony had been detained during his transportation
    to the station and up until the start of his interview with Detective Hill.  Although
    the trial judge held that Mr. Anthony was not detained during the interview
    with Detective Hill, he found that the interview had been tainted by the
    detention: “In my opinion if a person is treated like a suspect in terms
    of the control of his freedom of movement, there are onerous circumstances
    put into play.”  Because of these “onerous circumstances”, the trial judge
    was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Anthony’s statement
    was made voluntarily.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the interview in the police cruiser with Officer Chu was different.  When
    that interview took place, Mr. Anthony was not being “treated like a suspect”
    and no “onerous circumstances” were in play.  The trial judge was therefore
    convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Anthony’s statement was voluntary.  I
    find this conclusion reasonable.</p>
  <h2>2.         The Defence of Accident and the <i>Mens</i> <i>Rea</i> for Murder</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, Mr. Anthony put forward two main defences: he was not guilty because
    the harm that he caused to Ms. Jamieson was accidental; or, he was guilty
    only of manslaughter because he was drunk and did not have the required <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for
    murder.  The trial judge charged the jury consistently with the defence’s
    position.  He related the defence of accident to the question whether Mr.
    Anthony committed an unlawful act necessary for manslaughter, and he related
    the defence of intoxication to the question whether Mr. Anthony had the specific
    intent for murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, however, Ms. Verner in her able argument for Mr. Anthony submits
    that the trial judge erred in where he discussed the defence of accident.  She
    contends that accident was relevant not to whether Mr. Anthony committed
    an unlawful act but to whether he had the required intent for murder.  Thus,
    the trial judge should have related the defence of accident to the question
    whether Mr. Anthony was guilty of murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    also contends that the trial judge further compounded this error in two ways:
    he spent a significant portion of his charge on whether Mr. Anthony was guilty
    of first or second degree murder, when second degree murder was not even
    a possible verdict; and he answered questions from the jury by repeating
    the error in his original charge.</p>
  <h2>(a)       The location of the defence of accident in the trial judge’s
    charge </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave the jury a series of decision trees to assist them in working
    through the various scenarios available to them.  Each decision tree had
    a series of questions.  One of the decision trees was for murder and it contained
    three questions.  The trial judge discussed each question as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    Mr. Anthony cause Ms. Jamieson’s death?  The trial judge properly told the
    jury they should have no difficulty in answering “yes” to this question.  The
    defence acknowledged as much.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    Mr. Anthony cause Ms. Jamieson’s death unlawfully?  The unlawful act the
    Crown relied on was Mr. Anthony’s sexual assault of Ms. Jamieson by “fisting” her
    and causing her internal injuries.  The trial judge told the jury that they
    would have to decide whether Mr. Anthony intended to cause Ms. Jamieson harm
    or whether the initial “fisting” was consensual and what happened to her
    was an accident.  If the jury had a reasonable doubt that what happened to
    Ms. Jamieson was an accident, or in other words, they had a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Anthony unlawfully caused her death, they must acquit.  If not,
    they had to go on to the next question.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    Mr. Anthony have the state of mind required for murder?  The trial judge
    instructed the jury on the specific intent required for murder.  He then
    told the jury that in deciding whether Mr. Anthony had the state of mind
    for murder, they could take into account the evidence of his alcohol consumption.  He
    reviewed that evidence, which included drinking several glasses of beer at
    the bar and about half of a forty ounce bottle of rum at his apartment.  The
    trial judge instructed the jury that if, after taking into account the evidence
    of intoxication and other evidence, they were not satisfied Mr. Anthony had
    the state of mind for murder, they must find him guilty of manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    essence of Mr. Anthony’s submission on appeal is that the trial judge should
    have discussed the defence of accident under the third question, not the
    second question.  He argues that the central issue at trial was whether he
    had the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for murder.  He says that he conceded his
    acts were intentional and thus he could not rely on accident to exonerate
    him of manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept Mr. Anthony’s submission for two reasons.  First, the trial
    judge extensively discussed with counsel the content and structure of his
    charge, including the location of the defence of accident; both Crown and
    defence counsel approved the charge in advance and took no objection to it
    after its delivery.  Second, Mr. Anthony did not concede that his actions
    were intentional.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge met with counsel on his proposed charge six times.  He heard
    submissions on what he should say to the jury over two days.  He gave counsel
    drafts of his charge and time to review them.  He asked for and took their
    input into account.  And he gave the Crown and the defence a full draft of
    his charge before delivering it.  As I have said, neither counsel complained
    beforehand or objected afterwards.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Now,
    Mr. Anthony’s new appeal counsel seeks to second guess his trial counsel’s
    tactical decisions.  Defence counsel at trial decided where discussing the
    defence of “accident” might best advance his client’s cause.  Mr. Anthony’s
    appeal counsel takes an entirely different position.  I do not think that
    this court should accede to it.  As Doherty J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Austin</i> (2006),
    214 C.C.C. (3d) 38 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 14, an appellate court is understandably reluctant to accept arguments
    that contradict positions taken at trial:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Arguments by appellate counsel that fly in the face of positions taken
    by counsel at trial quite properly attract judicial scepticism and resistance.  The
    significance of counsel’s position at trial to the merits of the argument
    on appeal will depend on the nature of the argument advanced on appeal.  Where
    it is alleged that an instruction to the jury was unclear, inadequate on
    a legal or evidentiary issue raised in the trial, or did not treat the position
    of the appellant at trial fairly or fully, counsel’s approval of the jury
    instruction and to a lesser extent his or her failure to object, will be
    a significant consideration on appeal…. Similarly, where an appellant argues
    that the trial judge failed to give an instruction that was discretionary,
    counsel’s failure to request the instruction at trial will be a significant
    consideration on appeal…. Counsel’s position at trial will become all the
    more significant on appeal if it appears that the position reflects a calculated
    tactical decision…. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trial
    judges have to rely on the positions of trial counsel, as the trial judge
    did in this case.  Otherwise we risk undermining the adversary system on
    which the administration of criminal justice so critically depends.  Finlayson
    J.A. made this point in <i>R. v. Lomage</i> (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 621 at 630:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Defence counsel assumes a great deal of responsibility in a criminal case
    and when he makes a decision, both he and his client must live with it.  It
    is no function of this court to play the role of what in football terminology
    is called a “Monday morning quarterback”
    when it comes to trial tactics employed by counsel.  If we were to do so,
    it would have the effect of placing an unhelpful burden on the trial judge.  Instead
    of being able to rely on the competence of counsel who must know more about
    the case than the trial judge, we would effectively be saying that the trial
    court has an overriding responsibility to vet tactical decisions of counsel
    and, where necessary, to vary or reverse them.  Such overweening paternalism
    denigrates the adversary system.  Had the court taken such an approach in
    this case, it would have amounted to an unjustified interference in the role
    of both Crown and defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court may take a different view if convinced that the position advanced at
    trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice or otherwise deprived the accused
    of a fair trial.  That, however, is not the case here.  The trial judge placed
    the defence of accident fairly before the jury and thoroughly reviewed the
    evidence supporting that defence.  Obviously the jury rejected the contention
    that what happened to Ms. Jamieson was accidental.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second reason I do not accept Mr. Anthony’s position is because he did not
    concede he had the intent to commit an unlawful act and was guilty of manslaughter.  Instead,
    his trial counsel argued forcefully that the jury should find him not guilty
    because what happened to Ms. Jamieson was an accident.  Defence counsel set
    out Mr. Anthony’s position in giving his overview of the case to the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>His honour will explain to you about the law of accident.  I will tell
    you in a moment why what happened was an accident and as a result why you
    should acquit Mr. Anthony.  However, if all of you in your good judgment
    decide the Crown has convinced you beyond any reasonable doubt that this
    was not an accident then there is something else I am going to ask you to
    consider.  And His Honour will explain to you what the law is with regards
    to intoxication.  I am also going to tell you why as a result of what he
    had to drink Mr. Anthony was unable to commit murder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then,
    after discussing the relevance of the defence of accident to Mr. Anthony’s
    alleged unlawful act, and arguing for an acquittal, defence counsel said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>If the Crown has convinced you beyond a reasonable doubt that what happened
    to Ms. Jamieson was not an accident, then you will be asked to decide whether
    what happened to Ms. Jamieson constituted a crime of culpable homicide.  In
    other words, murder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    retrospect, the defence might have been more effective had it conceded that
    Mr. Anthony was guilty of manslaughter and argued that both intoxication
    and accident negated the required intent for murder.  But that was not the
    defence’s position at trial.  The trial judge instructed the jury on accident
    consistently with the way defence counsel argued it to the jury.  I therefore
    cannot accept that the trial judge erred by where he located the defence
    of accident in his charge.</p>
  <h2>(b)       Instruction on first and second degree murder </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Anthony submits that the trial judge further confused the jury by charging
    them both on first and second degree murder.  He contends that second degree
    murder was not even a possible verdict because the alleged unlawful act for
    manslaughter was a sexual assault.  Therefore, if he is guilty of murder
    he must be guilty of first degree murder (a sexual assault during the course
    of an intentional killing).  Yet a significant portion of the trial judge’s
    charge centred on whether Mr. Anthony was guilty of first or second degree
    murder.  Mr. Anthony submits that this part of the trial judge’s charge was
    superfluous and shifted the jury’s attention from the real issues they had
    to resolve.  I do not agree with this submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    conviction for second degree murder was an unlikely verdict, but a possible
    verdict.  Although the defence conceded the “sexual nature” of Mr. Anthony’s
    acts, it refused to concede that Mr. Anthony was guilty of sexual assault.  If
    the jury accepted the defence’s position but nonetheless found that Mr. Anthony
    intended to cause Ms. Jamieson bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
    her death and was reckless whether she died (or he simply intended to kill
    her) they would have found him guilty of second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    however unlikely a verdict, the defence endorsed the charge on second degree
    murder.  The defence agreed that a murder conviction would drop from first
    to second if a sexual offence was not made out.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s instructions on first and second degree murder undoubtedly
    lengthened the charge, but especially in view of the defence’s position,
    they were not superfluous.  More importantly, they reflected no error.  </p>
  <h2>(c)       The trial judge’s answers to the jury’s questions </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury asked three questions.  In answering these questions, the trial judge
    largely repeated the relevant parts of his charge.  Mr. Anthony submits that
    by doing so he compounded his original error.  I disagree.  The trial judge
    answered the jury’s questions appropriately and correctly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury first asked the trial judge to repeat his instructions on two branches
    of the decision tree for murder: the definition of “unlawfully” in the question “did
    Mr. Anthony cause Ms. Jamieson’s death unlawfully”; and the state of mind
    required for murder.  With counsel’s agreement the trial judge did so.  Neither
    counsel objected to the re-charge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury’s second question asked “must the murder tree be followed in order to
    reach a decision or is it just a guideline?”  The trial judge discussed the
    appropriate answer with counsel, who agreed that he repeat his instructions
    about the use of the decision tree.  Again, neither counsel objected to this
    re-charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury’s third question asked the trial judge again to clarify the requisite “state
    of mind” for murder and “if we say yes, do we move on?”  Counsel agreed that
    the answer to the second part of the question was “yes the jury should move
    on”, and the trial judge so re-charged the jury.  In answering the first
    part of the third question, the defence proposed that the trial judge expand
    on his original charge.  The trial judge asked the jury to clarify whether
    they wanted him to repeat his original instruction or give them a
    “reader’s digest” version.  They opted for a repetition of his original instruction.  The
    defence then made a further request that the trial judge include in his answer
    a summary of each side’s theory of the case.  The trial judge declined to
    do so, stating that the theories had already been clearly put.  He simply
    repeated his original instruction, which is what the jury had asked for.  </p>

    jury’s questions show that they were struggling with but focused on the two
    central issues debated by the Crown and the defence: first, did Mr. Anthony
    commit an unlawful act or was it accidental?; and second, did Mr. Anthony
    have the intent to kill or was he too drunk?  The trial judge’s instructions
    on these issues were fully and fairly set out in his charge and were approved
    by counsel.  He did not err by repeating the instructions that the jury had
    requested: see <i>R. v. Desveaux</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 88 at 93 (Ont.

  <h2>3.         The Trial Judge’s Non-Direction on Mr. Anthony’s Post-Offence
    Conduct </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown pointed to Mr. Anthony’s post-offence conduct as circumstantial evidence
    pointing to his guilt.  It relied on three pieces of evidence: Mr. Anthony
    cleaned up his apartment before the police arrived; he delayed calling 9-1-1;
    and he ran some errands.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge properly instructed the jury on both the innocent and culpable
    explanations for Mr. Anthony’s conduct.  For example, the trial judge told
    the jury that Mr. Anthony has an innocent explanation for cleaning up his
    apartment: he was bothered by the mess.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Anthony, however, submits that the trial judge’s instruction on post-offence
    conduct was in error in one respect.  He failed to tell the jury that although
    Mr. Anthony’s conduct could help them determine whether he committed a crime,
    it could not help them determine whether the crime was murder or manslaughter.  I
    agree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury that if they rejected any innocent explanation
    for Mr. Anthony’s conduct they could consider this conduct in reaching its
    verdict:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you find what
    James Anthony said or did afterwards is consistent with him being conscious
    of having done what is alleged against him and you reject the possibility
    that it could have been for some innocent reason … you may consider that
    evidence together with all of the other evidence in reaching your verdict. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reinforced this instruction when he summarized the Crown’s position
    for the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The after-the-fact
    conduct of Mr. Anthony, including his cleaning up of the scene, the lengthy
    delay in calling 911 and his activities the next morning, including calling
    Steve Sperry and offering to pay for his wages, the Crown submits are consistent
    with actions of first degree murder and not accident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Mr. Anthony did not admit his culpability for his actions, the trial judge
    was correct in instructing the jury that they could consider Mr. Anthony’s
    post-offence conduct in determining his guilt.  However, beginning with the
    Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i> (1994), 87
    C.C.C. (3d) 385 the case law has recognized that an accused’s post-offence
    conduct cannot be used to determine an accused’s level of culpability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    to be entirely accurate the trial judge also should have told the jury that
    though they could use Mr. Anthony’s post-offence conduct to determine his
    culpability, they could not use it to determine whether he was guilty of
    murder or manslaughter.  This failure to so instruct the jury – this non-direction – as
    the Crown acknowledged in oral argument, amounted to an error in law: see <i>R.
    v. Fraser</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 540 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Peavoy </i>(1999),
    117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s charge on Mr. Anthony’s post-offence conduct was otherwise
    accurate and fair.  The remaining question is whether the trial judge’s non-direction
    deprived Mr. Anthony of a fair trial.  I do not think that it did.  The post-offence
    conduct was relatively minor.  Defence counsel did not object to the trial
    judge’s instruction.  And, as the Crown said in oral argument, this case
    did not turn on why Mr. Anthony cleaned up his apartment, when he called
    9-1-1, or why he ran errands.  The trial judge’s non-direction, therefore,
    caused no substantial wrong.  I would apply the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2><span> </span>4.        Sexual Arousal and the <i>Mens Rea</i> for Murder</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Anthony also submits that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that
    Mr. Anthony’s excitement or sexual arousal could give rise to the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for
    murder.  I see no merit in this submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge fairly told the jury that these emotions of excitement or sexual
    arousal could either detract from or give rise to the <i>mens rea </i>for
    murder.  This instruction was balanced, approved by defence counsel, and
    largely in accord with Justice David Watt’s

  <h2><span> </span>C.       CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not err in admitting into evidence Mr. Anthony’s statement
    to Officer Chu at the scene.  Nor did he err in his charge to the jury either
    on the defence of accident or on the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> for murder.  Although
    the trial judge did err in one respect in his charge on Mr. Anthony’s post-offence
    conduct, that error caused no substantial wrong and did not deprive Mr. Anthony
    of a fair trial.  Accordingly, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
