style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case involves a dispute between two current or former shareholders of Ideal
    Construction Co. Limited, a closely held investment holding corporation.  The
    appellant challenges the legal effectiveness of the transfer in 2000 of Ideal
    shares held by Mountell Investments Limited (“Limited”) effected by Limited’s
    trustee in bankruptcy and its lead secured creditor (a bank that held a security
    interest in the Ideal shares in priority to the trustee’s interest in the
    shares) in favour of Mountell Investments Inc. (“Inc.”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ideal shares were subject to share transfer restrictions set out in Ideal’s
    amended articles of incorporation.  The appellant argues that the transfer
    of the Ideal shares did not comply with these restrictions in several respects
    and, consequently, that the transfer was ineffective to convey title in the
    shares to Inc.  It also argues that a confirming conveyance of the Ideal
    shares to Inc. by Limited’s trustee in bankruptcy carried out in 2005 was
    similarly ineffective.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  The motion judge stated in part, at paras. 30 to 33 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[30]     The
    Trustee transferred its title in Limited to Inc. with respect to the shares
    in Ideal for good and proper con-sideration with full knowledge of the facts
    and concurrence of the only creditors necessary.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[31]     I can
    see no reason other than an improper motive that would cause Ideal through
    its CEO to refuse a transfer [of the shares].  The evidence on this motion
    does satisfy me that [the husband of W.Z., the controlling shareholder of
    Limited] did at all times hold the Ideal shares in Limited [<i>sic</i>] for
    her benefit.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[32]     When
    the issue of concern was raised by Munrealty, the controlling interest in
    Inc. was transferred to W.Z. who was entitled both in law and equity in my
    view to have the transfer recognized, which was done by Ideal.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[33]     If for
    any reason I am in error that the legal entitlement to the Ideal shares was
    with the trustee and not validly transferred to [Inc.], there can be no doubt
    in my view with respect to the equitable entitlement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, even if the original transfer of the Ideal shares in 2000 was defective
    for non-compliance with the share transfer restrictions applicable to the
    shares, this defect was effectively cured by the 2005 confirming transfer
    of the Ideal shares from Limited’s trustee in bankruptcy to Inc.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    we agree with the motion judge that in the particular circumstances of this
    case, equitable title in the Ideal shares passed to Inc. under the 2000 transaction.  The
    cases relied upon by the appellant to argue that equitable title was not
    so conveyed do not assist.  In this case, as noted by the motion judge, the
    original share transaction was supported by valid consideration, the facts
    regarding Limited’s holdings in Ideal were fully disclosed to all interested
    parties, and the transfer of Limited’s assets to Inc., including the Ideal
    shares, was approved by the court.  The record makes clear that, throughout,
    both Limited’s trustee in bankruptcy and its major creditor – who, as we
    have said, held a priority security interest in the shares – did everything
    in their power to transfer good and valid title in the Ideal shares to Inc.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, no party to Limited’s bankruptcy now complains of the transfer
    of the Ideal shares to Inc.  Furthermore, the appellant is the only shareholder
    of Ideal to take issue with the transfer.  Yet, at its core, the issue of
    the validity of Inc.’s ownership of the Ideal shares is an issue between
    Inc. and Limited’s trustee in bankruptcy and its creditors.  The appellant
    is neither.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also agree with the respondents’ submission that while the appellant may
    have had an interest in who owned the shares of Ideal when Ideal was an operating
    company, once Ideal became subject to a winding-up order (to which the appellant
    consented), any such interest ceased and was in the hands of Ideal’s liquidator
    and the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we observe that the appellant’s attack on the challenged share transfer is
    predicated on the theory that Limited and its principal, W.Z., wrongly concealed
    their bankruptcies and effected the Ideal share transfer in contravention
    of the share transfer restrictions applicable to Ideal’s shares for the purpose
    of facilitating an improper scheme by one of Ideal’s other shareholders to
    wind up the company, thereby damaging the appellant’s interests.  Whatever
    the merits of this assertion when viewed in the wider context of the pending
    oppression proceedings between the parties, it cannot be tested or determined
    on the record now before this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no issue that in light of our conclusion, detailed above, there is no
    need to address the appellant’s claim for the appointment of a replacement
    trustee in the bankruptcy of Limited.  That issue is moot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to the costs of this
    appeal, fixed in the total amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.  The costs of the motion regarding the letter of credit are a
    matter for the Superior Court of Justice in the pending oppression proceedings.</p>
