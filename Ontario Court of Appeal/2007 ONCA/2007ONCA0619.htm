  <h4>A.    INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent, Dobieslaw Dabrowski, was charged
    with committing five criminal offences <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> uttering a threat by telephone contrary to s.&nbsp;264.1(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>; criminal harassment (s.
    264(3)); and making, possessing and distributing child pornography, in the form
    of a videotape (s.&nbsp;163.1(2), (4) and (3)).  All of the charges related to a relationship the respondent had with a
    young schoolgirl.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following a one&#8209;week trial in which the
    respondent and the complainant both testified, the trial judge, Leitch&nbsp;J.
    acquitted the respondent on all charges.  The Crown appeals the acquittals on only two of the charges <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> possession and
    distribution of child pornography.</p>
  <h4>B.        FACTS</h4>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>            (1)       </span>The
    parties and events</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent had a four or five month
    relationship with a schoolgirl in 2004.  She was fourteen years old at the time.  The respondent was twenty&#8209;eight, although he lied to his young
    partner, saying he was nineteen.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relationship quickly became sexual.  The partners decided to videotape some of the
    sexual activity.  Sometimes they were
    alone when the filming took place; on other occasions, some of the respondent’s
    young male friends were present during the filming.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After several months, the relationship
    ended.  The respondent gave the
    videotapes to one of his young friends for ‘safekeeping’.  Eventually, the complainant’s family found
    out about the tapes and the complainant went to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was charged with five offences,
    three relating to the tapes and two relating to the threats the respondent
    allegedly made to the complainant after their break&#8209;up.</p>
  <h4><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial decision</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge acquitted the respondent on all
    charges.  With respect to the three
    pornography charges, she reviewed the wording of s.&nbsp;163.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  She then turned to a consideration of the
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. Sharpe</i> (2001), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 321, which created two exceptions to the
    offences prescribed therein.  McLachlin
    C.J.C. described the second exception in this fashion at paras. 75 and 76:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Yet problems remain.  The interpretation of the legislation suggested above reveals that the
    law may catch some material that particularly engages the value of self&#8209;fulfilment
    and poses little or no risk of harm to children.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The second class of material concerns privately
    created visual recording of lawful sexual activity made by or depicting the
    person in possession and <i>intended only
    for private use</i>.  Sexually explicit
    photographs taken by a teenager of him- or herself, and kept entirely in
    private, would fall within this class of materials.  Another example would be a teenaged couple’s
    private photographs of themselves engaged in lawful sexual activity.  Possession of such materials may implicate
    the values of self&#8209;fulfilment and self&#8209;actualization, and
    therefore…reside near the heart of the [<i>Charter</i>]
    s. 2(b) guarantee…[T]his material poses little risk of harm to children.  It is privately created and intended only for
    personal use.  It depicts only lawful
    sexual activity.                                                                                       [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge determined that, in spite of
    alcohol consumption, the complainant had the capacity to consent to engage in
    the sexual activity that was filmed.  She
    further held that the complainant did consent to the activity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the “private use” component of the second <i>Sharpe</i> exception, the trial judge
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown submits that by the very fact that the
    tapes were given to Sean Forde, Mr. Dabrowski has made them available to
    another person which causes the tapes to fall outside the <i>Sharpe </i>exception.  In my view
    the requirement that the tapes be created for private use does not mean that
    the tapes have to remain in the creator’s actual possession.  As set out in s.&nbsp;4(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, possession may be actual
    or it may be attributed by operation of law in the three circumstances set out
    in s.&nbsp;483(a)(ii).  Specifically, a
    person is in possession of an item when he knowingly has it in the actual
    custody or possession of another.  The
    item is therefore in the actual possession of one person and attributed to the
    other.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There was no evidence that the tapes were made
    available or put in public viewing.  The
    only evidence is that they were given to someone for safe keeping who did not
    watch them, who was asked not to watch them or show them to anyone, who did not
    have a camera to play them on, or copy them and who hid them.  The fact that the tapes were not erased is
    evidence I have considered, but that evidence in the context of the other
    evidence I have outlined is not sufficient to satisfy me that the tapes were
    not created for private use.  I am not
    satisfied that the video tapes were created or possessed with anything other
    than the intention for personal use.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown does not appeal the acquittals on the
    uttering a threat, criminal harassment or making child pornography charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown does appeal the acquittals on the
    possession and distribution of child pornography charges.  Although it does not contest the trial
    judge’s conclusions on the consent issue, relating to both capacity and the fact
    of consent, the Crown challenges the trial judge’s conclusion on the “private
    use” component of the second exception in <i>Sharpe</i>.  The Crown’s challenge is two&#8209;pronged:
    (1) the trial judge’s interpretation of “private use” is too expansive <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> the <i>Sharpe</i> exception does not reach this
    case where this respondent gave the tapes to a young friend; and (2) the trial
    judge did not resolve a crucial factual question, namely, whether the
    respondent threatened to show the videos to the complainant’s family and
    friends if she did not comply with his rules in certain areas.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits that if it is successful on
    the first ground of appeal, the appropriate remedy is that this court enter
    convictions on the possession and distribution charges; if it is successful on
    only the second ground of appeal, the proper disposition is an order for a new
    trial.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>C.        </span>ISSUES</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown frames the issues in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>(1)       The trial
    judge erred in concluding that the respondent’s possession of the videotapes
    fell within the second exception to s.&nbsp;163.1 in <i>Sharpe</i>, having regard to the fact that he gave the tapes to Sean
    Forde; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>(2)       The trial
    judge erred in failing to appreciate that the respondent’s threats to show the
    videotapes to the complainant’s family and friends rendered the second <i>Sharpe</i> exception unavailable.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>D.        </span>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, this appeal can, and should, be
    resolved on the basis of the second issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue of the respondent’s alleged threats
    directed towards the complainant was, of course, central to the first two
    charges in the indictment, uttering a threat and criminal harassment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The substance of the complainant’s allegations
    giving rise to these charges was that the respondent had threatened, if the
    complainant did not obey his rules, to get someone to slice her breasts and her
    face so that other men would not be interested in her.  He underlined this threat by telling the
    complainant that he had arranged with other girls to stab his former girlfriend
    when she disobeyed him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge dealt with these alleged threats
    in a detailed fashion.  Although she
    rejected the respondent’s testimony and found the complainant’s testimony
    credible on many issues, the trial judge doubted her testimony about the
    threats of potential physical harm:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the Crown has proved the essential elements of count one and count two as
    described above.  Threats of the nature
    described by [the complainant] are not consistent with her evidence that their
    break up was mutual.  Her evidence
    regarding the threats and harassment is inconsistent with her evidence that she
    still cared for him and had feelings for him.  I do not accept the Crown’s submissions that this relationship should be
    assessed as one would an ongoing violent domestic relationship.  Her e-mails are inconsistent with her being
    threatened and harassed.  Her repeated
    contact with him is inconsistent with her being threatened and harassed.  Her explanation that she sent the e-mails and
    contacted him to stay on his good side is not credible when she testified at
    the same time she believed that he would act on his threats.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Accordingly, the trial judge
    acquitted the respondent on the uttering a threat and criminal harassment
    charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An allegation that the respondent threatened the
    complainant about use of the videotapes was an important, but not the central,
    issue on the three pornography charges.  In her oral reasons, the trial judge described the complainant’s
    testimony about these threats:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>She testified that after they broke-up Mr. Dabrowski
    told her that if she didn’t follow his rules, such as not going to basketball
    games, or all ages clubs, he would show the videos to her family and friends or
    put them on a website, and he said that more than once, but not as often as the
    other threats I have described.  She said
    she believed him and it scared her because she didn’t want anyone else to see
    them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, in reasons that are otherwise
    comprehensive and clear, the trial judge said nothing more about these alleged
    threats.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent submits that this omission is of
    no consequence.  He points to the fact
    that the evidence relating to threats of physical harm to the complainant and
    threats to show the videotapes to others was often linked during the trial.  For example, in the re&#8209;examination the
    complainant testified:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Okay.  And when you say, “So that nothing would happen”, what were you
    concerned might happen?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        That the threats suddenly would, he
    would follow through with them.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Okay.  And, specifically, which threats?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        About him showing the videotapes to my
    friends and family and making a website or getting me cut up or beat up.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The respondent submits that, in
    light of this linkage, it can be presumed that the trial judge’s explicit
    rejection of the complainant’s testimony concerning the threats of physical
    harm can and should be extended into an implicit rejection of her testimony
    about the threats of showing the videos to others.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I acknowledge that there is merit in this
    submission.  However, in the end I cannot
    accept it for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, in my view there is a significant
    difference in the nature of the two categories of alleged threats.  A threat to get third parties to physically
    harm a partner in a relationship and a threat to show a videotape of consensual
    sexual activity to third parties are quite different threats.  I do not think that a detailed analysis of,
    and clear conclusion relating to, the former should lightly be extended to the
    latter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the trial judge comprehensively and
    emphatically rejected the respondent’s testimony.  On the other hand, she found much of the
    complainant’s testimony to be credible, although she rejected her testimony
    relating to the alleged physical threats.  In light of this combination of credibility assessments, again I
    hesitate to imply that the trial judge reached a firm conclusion about the
    second category of alleged threats.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, whether the threats about showing the
    videotapes to others were actually made is, in my view, a crucial fact in terms
    of the legal analysis of s.&nbsp;163.1 of the <i>Code</i>.  This is clear from
    what McLachlin C.J.C. said in <i>Sharpe</i> at para. 118:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I reiterate that the protection afforded by this
    exception would extend no further than to materials intended solely for private
    use.  If materials were show to be held
    with any intention other than for personal use, their possession would then
    fall outside the exception’s aegis and be subject to the full force of
    s.&nbsp;163.1(4).  Indeed, such
    possession might also run afoul of the manufacturing and distributing offences
    set out in s-ss.&nbsp;163.1(2) and 163.1(3).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I conclude that the trial
    judge did not make a finding about whether the respondent threatened to show
    the videotapes to the complainant’s family and friends.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent contends that the absence of a
    finding by the trial judge on the threat issue is not a fatal omission because
    the trial judge acquitted him on a different basis, namely, her interpretation
    of the “private use” component of the second exception in <i>Sharpe</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not accept this submission.  In my view, the threat issue is, factually,
    at the heart of this case and has to be considered along with all of the
    evidence of the actions of the respondent in order to determine whether the
    “private use” exception applies in this case.  Accordingly, the trial judge should have resolved it so that the
    required legal analysis could have taken place against the backdrop of findings
    on all of the important factual circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It follows that a new trial will be
    necessary.  To assist the judge presiding
    at the new trial, I make this observation.  In this appeal, the Crown submitted that there should be what I would
    call a ‘bright line’ definition of the “private use” exception: “[P]ossession
    must mean physical possession, and must be exclusive possession to the extent
    that it includes only those with a legal right to possess the material….There
    is no justifiable reason for permitting an individual to ‘share’ possession of
    the material with anyone else for any reason.” (Crown factum, paras. 50 and
    51).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected this ‘bright line’
    submission.  In my view, she was
    right.  Although the “private use”
    exception should be applied with genuine caution, it goes too far to equate it
    in an absolute fashion with exclusive possession.  Such an equation would render unlawful such
    activities as placing these videotapes in a safety deposit box or turning them
    over to a lawyer or other trusted person for safekeeping.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, there is an evidentiary connection
    between holding relevant material in ‘strict privacy’ and maintaining exclusive
    possession.  It is a factual question
    whether giving up exclusive possession results in a loss of strict
    privacy.  Each case must be assessed on
    its own facts.  Questions such as to whom
    was the material given, what was the purpose or reason for the transfer, what
    terms or conditions were agreed upon when the material was given up, what
    control did the accused maintain over the material, was the material in fact
    viewed by anyone other than the consensual participants, would be relevant, all
    in the context of the credibility of the accused and others.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>E.        </span>DISPOSITION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal and order a new trial
    on the charges of possession and distribution of pornography.  The acquittals on the other three charges
    stand.</p>
