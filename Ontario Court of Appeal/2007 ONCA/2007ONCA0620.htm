style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal concerns the applicability of forum selection clauses in a series
    of commercial agreements involving the international tourism industry.  The
    issue is whether the forum selection clauses, found in a series of “tour
    operator” agreements, apply to the respondent’s claims against the appellants.
    The respondent’s claims are based on a separate document (entitled
    “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum”) that does not contain a forum
    selection clause.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found the “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum” to be
    one of three guarantees involving different parties than the tour operator
    agreements and therefore constituting entirely separate and distinct agreements.  Given
    this finding, she held that the forum selection clauses in the tour operator
    agreements did not apply.  For the following reasons, I conclude that the
    motion judge erred, that the
    “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum” forms part and parcel of the
    tour operator agreements, and that the forum selection clauses apply to this
    action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants Occidental Hotels Management B.V., Allegro Resorts Marketing Corporation,
    Allegro Marketing de Espana, S.L.U., and Horeca Interservices N.V. are separately
    incorporated in various jurisdictions and are members of the “Occidental
    Group”. The Occidental Group has no corporate status of its own; rather,
    it is a conglomerate of separately incorporated entities that facilitates
    the management and marketing of resort properties.  The appellant Slam Inc.,
    carrying on business as VOX Travel Management, acted throughout as the Occidental
    Group’s Canadian representative. In particular, VOX negotiates with
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario tour operators, such as Red Seal Tours Inc., tour operator agreements
    for room allotments and pricing at Occidental Group hotels. These negotiations
    occur on a global basis; thereafter, the operators sign separate tour operator
    agreements with the individual resorts or hotels. These agreements are standard
    form contracts based on the global negotiations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    April 28, 2003, Red Seal and Vox had negotiated and agreed to the terms of
    the tour operator agreements. Draft written agreements between Red Seal and
    each of the hotels were then sent to Red Seal.  The draft agreements contained
    standard terms relating to room allotments, number of rooms, pricing, reservations,
    limitation of liability, payment, and no-shows.  All but one of these agreements
    contain the following choice of forum clause: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Each party hereto
    irrevocably agrees to refer over the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Aruba courts any matters arising this agreement [sic], where each party irrevocably
    waives any applicable law.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons specific to Cuban law, the other tour operator agreement, which involves
    a hotel in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
    , contains a similar clause naming
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Cuba</st1:country-region>
    as the selected forum.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    before the April 28, 2003 agreements were executed, the respondent sought
    better terms and there were further negotiations between April and October.  These
    negotiations led to three documents providing Red Seal with additional guarantees
    at particular resorts. These three iterations of the agreement were signed,
    and are the focus of this appeal.  After the second document was finalized,
    the tour operator agreements were executed on October 29, 2003.  The final
    iteration was entitled “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum”.  This
    document, executed on November 21, 2003, contains, in point form, certain
    specific terms relating to six of the eight hotels for which there are tour
    operator agreements.  Those terms include changes to the room rates and allotments
    contained in the tour operator agreements, a “no-bumping” term, and a rental
    guarantee on the part of the respondent for a certain percentage of the allotted
    rooms. The final version was signed on behalf of the Occidental Group by “Fernando
    Robles” whose signature appears to be the same as that on each of the tour
    operator agreements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found that there were three operative guarantee agreements and
    that the “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum”, as well as the two
    earlier iterations of that document, were enforceable.  With respect, this
    finding ignores the following clause in the final version: “This agreement
    supersedes all previous agreements”.  In my view, in the light of this language,
    the November 21, 2003 document is the final version and the only version
    that governs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    final version contains several significant features not found in the earlier
    iterations and not mentioned in the motion judge’s reasons.  These features
    strongly support the appellants’ position that any obligations created under
    this document are part and parcel of the tour operator agreements. First,
    it is described as a “Contract Addendum”. Second, while the earlier iterations
    were on the letterhead of “Occidental Hotels and Resorts”, the final version
    is framed as a grant of rights by six of the Hotels that are parties to the
    tour operator agreements. It begins: “The ‘Hotel’ as listed below grants
    the Tour Operator <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Sunwing by Red Seal
    Vacations </span>Special Offers applicable during the following dates:”.  Third,
    under the heading “Conditions” at the end of the document, the final version
    specifies that certain matters (Payment and No shows) are as “Per Contract” while
    others (Release and Allotment) are as “Per Guarantee Agreement”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    significant feature of the
    “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum” is the fact that it simply cannot
    be read as a stand-alone agreement.  Its terms deal with specific aspects
    of matters governed by the tour operator agreements. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, in the light of these features and terms of the “Guarantee/Special
    Rates/Contract Addendum”, <span lang=EN>the motion judge’s finding that the “Guarantee
    Agreements are independent, separately enforceable contracts” cannot be sustained.
    There is only one Guarantee Agreement, not three, and on the language of
    the relevant document, the conclusion that it is a contract entirely independent
    from the tour operator agreements is not supportable.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do I accept the submission that the parties to the tour operator agreements
    and the “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum” must be different because
    there are individual agreements with the hotels but only one “Guarantee/Special
    Rates/Contract Addendum”.  In my view, that submission ignores the fact that
    according to its terms, it is the named hotels that grant the appellant the
    rights conferred. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    any of the appellants are liable under the terms of this document or for
    alleged misrepresentations in its negotiation is a matter to be determined
    at trial, not on this motion or appeal.  However, at this stage of the proceedings,
    the respondent cannot escape the application of the choice of forum clauses
    by framing its claims as only being against the appellants, not against the
    hotels, and under the “Guarantee/Special Rates/Contract Addendum”, not the
    tour operator agreements. See Janet Walker, <i>Castel and Walker:</i> <i>Canadian
    Conflict of Laws</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Butterworths, 2005) at 13.58: “Parsing
    jurisdiction clauses to determine whether they apply to claims as they are
    framed could foster dubious efforts to evade legitimate agreements for dispute
    resolution, which can be of considerable significance in international commercial
    dealings.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is well-established that the law strongly favours the enforcement of choice
    of forum clauses and that special deference is owed to forum selection clauses
    found in international agreements involving sophisticated parties.  I do
    not accept the submission that there is “strong cause” to displace the forum
    chosen by the parties or that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario jurisdiction should be assumed on the basis that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Aruba is not the <i>forum conveniens</i>.  As the Supreme Court of Canada
    put it in <i>Z.I. Pompey Industrie v. ECU-Line N.V.</i>,<i> </i>[2003] 1
    S.C.R. 450 at para. 20, “[i]t is essential that the courts give full weight
    to the desirability of holding contracting parties to their agreements”.  The
    strong cause test imposes a “burden on the plaintiff to satisfy the court
    that there is good reason it should not be bound by the forum selection clause”.  The
    court held, at para. 21: “the starting point is that the parties should be
    held to their bargain” and “that the parties’ agreement is given effect <i>in
    all but exceptional circumstances</i>” [emphasis added].  This is a dispute
    involving many parties from many different jurisdictions.  These parties
    are sophisticated actors familiar with the tourist industry.  It was open
    to those parties to select a neutral forum for the resolution of their disputes.  While
    undoubtedly it would be more convenient for the respondent to pursue its
    claims in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, there are no “exceptional circumstances” to justify a departure
    from the forum selected in the agreements.  The respondent has failed to
    discharge its burden that the choice of forum clauses should be set aside.</p>

    I would allow the appeal, set aside the motion judge’s order, and substitute
    an order permanently staying the action.  Costs to the appellant fixed at
    $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
