    Crown appeals from the order of Epstein J. quashing a committal for second
    degree murder and substituting a committal for manslaughter. At the preliminary
    inquiry, the defence conceded that there was sufficient evidence to justify a
    committal for manslaughter. Accordingly, the sole issue on appeal is whether
    there was any evidence at the preliminary inquiry capable of supporting an
    inference that the respondent intended to cause bodily harm that she knew was
    likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued within the meaning
    of s. 229(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>

    at the preliminary inquiry indicated that as of November 13, 2003, Emmily was
    living with her mother, her mother's common law partner Johnny Bermudez, four
    older siblings, and her younger half-brother. The evidence also indicated that
    on November 12, 2003, Emmily sustained a small bruise under one eye on her
    cheekbone—and that the respondent told Mr. Bermudez that this happened when
    Emmily fell off the stairs and hit her face on a broomstick. At the preliminary
    inquiry, Mr. Bermudez testified that that he was not concerned and observed no
    other injuries. </span></p>

    Bermudez also testified that earlier in the day on November 13, 2003, he and
    the respondent took Emmily with them while they ran errands, which included an
    extended visit to a Canadian Tire store. According to Mr. Bermudez, Emmily was
    fine during this period and walked around eating chips and having a drink that
    they purchased from a vending machine. In addition, a nurse who observed the
    family at the store testified that Emmily seemed to walk normally and had good
    muscle control for her age. The nurse was able to see Emmily’s face and neck—he
    confirmed that he did not see anything unusual or any bruising. </span></p>

    room; Mr. Bermudez went upstairs with another child and the respondent went out
    briefly.   About 15-20 minutes after the
    respondent returned home, Mr. Bermudez heard a &quot;ruckus&quot; downstairs
    and ran to the living room. Emmily was very ill. He tried to give her CPR and
    mouth to mouth resuscitation, poked the inside of her eye to try to get some
    movement, slapped her cheeks, shook her, and pinched her all over.   </span></p>

    evidence led at the preliminary inquiry indicated that Emmily died as the
    result of oxygen deprivation to the brain and heart failure associated with
    central nervous system (brain and spinal chord)/ocular trauma. Dr. Chiasson (the
    pathologist who performed the autopsy) explained that in his view, the
    underlying problem was trauma to the brain associated with trauma to the eyes.
    The trauma would cause swelling of the brain and lead to cardiopulmonary
    arrest. This, in turn, interferes with blood flow to the brain causing more
    brain swelling and potentially more cardiopulmonary arrests. However, none of
    the doctors who testified at the preliminary inquiry was able to establish the exact
    mechanism of the fatal injury. </span></p>

    particular, Dr. Ramsay (a neuropathologist who examined Emmily’s brain and
    spinal chord after the autopsy) indicated that the injuries he observed could
    have been caused by shaking, a throw, multiple throws, or a blow. He said that
    the force necessary to cause such injuries &quot;would be readily recognizable
    as excessive&quot; and as &quot;potentially harmful&quot;. However, he acknowledged
    that he would be unable to say, based on the injuries alone, whether the force
    used was “harmful force or deadly force”. He also said that while the force
    used &quot;would be recognized as violence”, it would “not necessarily [be
    recognized as] deadly violence.” </span></p>

    the mechanism of injury was shaking, Dr. Ramsay testified that he was unable to
    draw a distinction between “the shaking of malice and the shaking of
    panic”—what he could say is that it would have to be “severe shaking, not the
    gentle shake that one would use for example to wake a child up.” Although he
    stated initially that, in his opinion Emmily would have been “immediately
    unconscious” due to the hemorrhaging, he later clarified that a child with this
    type of injuries would “show signs of it…immediately or within seconds to a minute
    or two.”</span></p>

    her scalp, a large area of bruising under her left eye (5.5 x 1.9 cm), a bruise
    on her left cheek, a small bruise on her right cheek, a small bruise under her
    lower lip, petechial hemorrhage on her left ear, bruising on her right ear, and
    mild scalp swelling near the laceration. He also described bruising on her
    shoulder, right arm, hand, abdomen, left arm, left leg, back, and hip. He was
    aware that retinal hemorrhaging had been discovered in her right eye and that
    she had a subdural hematoma with blood overlaying the brain. Although he could
    not time the bruises, he said that particularly with respect to the bruising on
    her face, ears, abdomen, and back, they could not have been caused by violent
    shaking performed to revive Emmily. </span></p>

    would have been necessary to cause Emmily’s brain injury—he said, “[i]t’s very,
    very, very, very significant.” However, he also explained that in contrast to
    the force associated with a car accident or a significant fall, “often times
    with blunt force trauma or with shaking [the acceleration] is not linear…but
    it’s a rotational acceleration which is a different type of force inflicting a
    different type of injury and sheering in the different layers of the brain.”</span></p>

    reviewing  judge found that the

    there was evidence capable of supporting an inference that the respondent had
    the necessary intent for second degree murder: i) the medical evidence; ii) the
    fact that the respondent was the mother of six children; and iii) the bruises. She
    concluded that the totality of the evidence did not support an inference that
    the respondent had the subjective intent necessary for second degree murder and
    therefore that the preliminary inquiry judge exceeded his jurisdiction in
    committing the respondent on that charge. </span></p>

    particular, the reviewing judge found that the medical evidence concerning the
    degree of force required to inflict Emmily’s injuries did not go far enough to
    support an inference that the respondent had the requisite intent for murder.
    Further, in the face of the medical evidence, drawing an inference that a mother
    of six would have the necessary insight to appreciate the consequences of the
    force she was using would be speculative.  Finally, the reviewing judge accepted a defence submission that the
    evidence of bruising was irrelevant to the intent issue since the medical evidence
    indicated it was impossible to distinguish between bruises caused by revival
    efforts and bruises caused by abuse. </span></p>

    of review on an application to quash a committal is extremely narrow—a reviewing
    judge is entitled to quash a committal only where the preliminary inquiry judge
    acted without jurisdiction: see <i>R. v.
    Russell</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 19-20 (S.C.C.).  While it is jurisdictional error to commit an
    accused for trial where there is no evidence capable of supporting a
    conviction, a preliminary judge has “the right to be wrong” in assessing the
    sufficiency of the evidence: see <i>R. v. <span

    our opinion, in holding that there was <i>no</i> evidence capable of supporting an inference that the respondent had the
    necessary intent for second degree murder, the reviewing judge erred in two
    related ways.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the reviewing judge erred in looking at the medical evidence in isolation
    without considering the potential inference(s) that would be open to a <span
class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact concerning the events leading up to Emmily’s
    fatal injuries. In our view, based on the evidence of Mr. Bermudez and the
    nurse who observed the family at the Canadian Tire store, there would be an
    available inference that, at a minimum, Emmily suffered some or all of the
    external facial injuries identified at The Hospital for Sick Children at the
    same time as she suffered the fatal injury. In these circumstances, a further
    inference would be available that Emmily suffered the fatal injury as part of
    an incident of more than fleeting duration that involved inflicting trauma to
    her head. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    agree with the respondent that there was also evidence pointing away from these
    inferences, for example, the evidence of Mr. Bermudez that he slapped and
    pinched Emmily in an attempt to resuscitate her and the evidence of a <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span> that he did not hear anything out of the ordinary
    around the time of the alleged incident. However, it would be for the <span
class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact to determine the weight to be afforded to
    such evidence—at this stage of the proceeding, this evidence does not therefore
    displace the potential inferences relied on by the Crown. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    in our view, the reviewing judge erred in failing to consider the potential
    inference(s) arising from the cumulative effect of the evidence relied on by
    the Crown.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Considered
    at its highest, the medical evidence confirmed that Emmily suffered the fatal
    injury as the result of “very, very, very, very significant force”. While the
    medical evidence indicated that such force would not necessarily be recognized
    as lethal, it did not exclude that prospect. It would be for the <span
class=SpellE>trier</span> of fact to determine the ultimate question of whether
    the respondent used force intending to inflict bodily harm that she knew was
    likely to cause death and being reckless whether death <span class=GramE>ensued</span> taking account of all of the evidence concerning the circumstances of the fatal
    injury.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    our view, when the medical evidence is considered in conjunction with the
    evidence about Emmily’s size, the respondent’s experience with small children
    and the evidence giving rise to the potential inference that Emmily suffered
    the fatal injury as part of an incident of more than fleeting duration that
    involved inflicting trauma to her head, there is a further potential inference
    that a reasonable person would realize that the force used in inflicting the
    fatal injury was likely to cause death. There being no evidence that the
    respondent’s capacity to know the consequences of her actions was impaired, that
    inference, in turn, would be capable of supporting an inference that the
    respondent used force in relation to Emmily intending to cause bodily that she
    knew was likely to cause death: <i>R. v. Magno</i> (2006), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 500

    all of the inferences in the foregoing chain of reasoning may be weak, in our
    view, they are available on the evidence and do not amount to impermissible
    speculation. We do not therefore agree that the preliminary inquiry judge
    committed jurisdictional error by committing the respondent for trial on the
    charge of second degree murder.</span></p>
