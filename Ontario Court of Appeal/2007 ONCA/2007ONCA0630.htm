  </table>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, David Pool, was involved in a motor
    vehicle accident.  The other driver,
    Andre Lehoux, was completely at fault.  The appellant, State Farm Insurance Companies, was Mr. Lehoux’s
    “underinsurance” carrier for damages over $200,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of a jury trial presided over by
    Desotti J., the jury awarded damages totalling $1,679,319.17.  This award encompassed general damages
    (including pre-judgment interest), future income loss and loss of housekeeping
    capacity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals on a number of grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    improperly interfered with its counsel’s cross-examination of the respondent on
    the issue of causation, in particular whether a recent back injury suffered by
    the respondent in a hockey game was the result of a cross-check or a spearing
    incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  In
    the single passage relied on as unwarranted interference by the trial judge in
    a hotly contested two-week trial, the trial judge merely summarized, briefly,
    the respondent’s clear testimony about the hockey injury and suggested to
    counsel that he move on.  Counsel did not
    object and did move on.  The trial
    judge’s intervention was not close to the type of interventions (lengthy,
    repeated, even harassing) that have been subject to critical comment in such
    cases as <i>Brouillard v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39, <i>Baker v.
    Hutchinson et al. </i>(1977), 13 O.R. (2d) 591 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    and <i>R. v. Valley</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred by admitting Dr. Lloyd’s medical report as an exhibit during the
    testimony of the respondent’s witness Marla Tennen, an expert in life-care
    planning and the assessment of the costs associated with such case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. There is no hard-and-fast rule about the
    admission of medical reports as exhibits: see <i>Ferraro v. Lee</i> (1974), 2
    O.R. (2d) 417 at 420 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The judge retains an overriding discretion to
    permit the admission of the report after the doctor has testified: see <i>Reimer
    v. Thivierge </i>(1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 309 at paras. 15-16 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point for a proper analysis is recognition
    that in Ms. Tennen’s report she did not factor in the possibility (mentioned in
    Dr. Lloyd’s report) that the respondent might develop arthritis at some point
    in the future.  Nor did Dr. Lloyd testify
    about this in his evidence at the trial.  In spite of these points, after Ms. Tennen mentioned arthritis in her
    examination-in-chief, defendant’s counsel cross-examined her at some length
    about Dr. Lloyd’s report, including the arthritis reference in it, with a view
    to challenging her understanding of the report.  In this context, the trial judge decided to admit Dr. Lloyd’s report as
    an exhibit so that the jury would be in a better position to assess Ms.
    Tennen’s testimony, including her credibility.  In our view, this was a proper exercise of the trial judge’s
    discretion.  The appellant made no
    objection to the way the trial judge left this evidence with the jury.  Moreover, importantly, the arthritis
    possibility was never mentioned again by anyone – in the pre-charge
    submissions, the closing addresses of counsel to the jury or the judge’s jury
    charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant challenges a number of aspects of
    the jury’s damages award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the award of $250,000 for
    general damages, which was 80 per cent of the cap for such damages, was
    inordinately high in light of the injuries suffered by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Koukounakis v. Stainrod </i>(1995), 23 O.R. (3d)
    299 at 305 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    Doherty J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, as here, the
    assessment was made by a jury, and there is no suggestion that the instructions
    to the jury were erroneous or deficient, the appellant must establish that the
    amount awarded is “so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous
    estimate of the damages”. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The award for general damages in this case was made by the jury
    and the appellant does not challenge the jury charge in any respect, including
    damages.  Although the jury’s award was
    high, we cannot say that it constituted “a wholly erroneous estimate of the
    damages”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the jury’s acceptance of an
    assessment based on the respondent continuing in his employment as a
    house-framer until age 65 was unrealistic and ignored the evidence relating to
    negative contingencies.  Again, in the
    absence of a challenge to the jury charge on these issues, we cannot see any
    basis for overturning or reducing the jury’s award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the jury award for future
    income loss with respect to the respondent’s part-time employment in the
    military reserve should be reduced because it was based on his continuing
    participation until age 65, whereas the respondent would have been compelled to
    retire at age 40.  The respondent agrees
    with this submission and quantifies this error as $140,000.  The appellant accepts this calculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the jury award for past and
    future housekeeping costs of $250,000 was, at a minimum, $100,000 too
    high.  Again, in the absence of a
    challenge to the jury charge on this issue, and bearing in mind that the jury
    award represented only one-half of the amount sought, we would not interfere
    with this component of the award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, but only to
    the extent of reducing the jury award by $140,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties are agreed that a proper costs award in
    this appeal would be $54,000 to the successful party.  Success is divided, but the balance tips in
    the respondent’s favour.  We award the
    respondent costs fixed at $25,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
