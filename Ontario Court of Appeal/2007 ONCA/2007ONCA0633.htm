    view, the appellant effectively challenges the validity of the proceedings
    because of a failure to comply with ss. 471 and 473 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    We do not accept this assertion.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 471 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires that every accused charged with an indictable
    offence be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury &quot;except where
    otherwise expressly provided by law&quot;. Section 473 of the Criminal Code
    permits an accused charged with second degree murder to be tried by a judge of
    a superior court of criminal jurisdiction without a jury where the accused and
    the Attorney General consent.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The transcript
    of the guilty plea proceedings discloses that counsel for the Crown and the
    appellant consented to the matter proceeding before Pierce J., a judge of the
    Ontario Superior Court, prior to the plea being taken. Although the Crown
    referred erroneously to s. 472 of the<i> Criminal Code</i> as the authority for
    this procedure, in our view, it is clear from the circumstances that both
    counsel intended to consent in accordance with s. 473 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Moreover, while the appellant did not expressly re-elect to be tried by a
    Superior Court judge sitting alone, his re-election is implicit in his s. 473
    consent and his plea of guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the
    appellant expressly claims that in the absence of evidence of a clear and
    unequivocal waiver of his rights to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in
    a fair and public hearing and to be tried by a jury, his rights under s. 7,
    11(d) and 11(f) of the <i>Charter</i> were violated by the proceedings in the
    Superior Court. In particular the appellant contends that in the absence of a
    preliminary inquiry and the misstatement of the appropriate section of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, the trial judge was obliged to make inquiries concerning whether he
    intended to waive his rights to a jury trial. The appellant also relies on the
    facts read in by the Crown, particularly about the level of intoxication of the
    participants in the alleged offence, to support his claim that the trial judge
    was obliged to make inquiries concerning his intent to waive his right to a jury
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject this
    argument. As noted, the appellant consented through his counsel to the matter
    proceeding before a Superior Court judge under s. 473 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. In addition, the
    appellant entered a plea of guilty to the charge of second degree murder in
    open court. Further, the appellant's counsel acknowledged that the facts read in
    by the Crown supporting the charge of second degree murder were accurate. Given
    these circumstances, in the absence of evidence undermining the validity of his
    guilty plea or a successful claim of incompetence of counsel, the appellant
    waived his right to a trial and there is no air of reality to the appellant's
    claim that his <i>Charter</i> rights were breached.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant's
    third ground of appeal is an allegation of incompetence of counsel. In our
    view, the appellant has not filed a scintilla of evidence which would support
    this very serious allegation. The only evidence filed by the appellant is the
    affidavit of David </span><span lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman";'>Gibson, the lawyer who filed the
    solicitor's notice of appeal. Mr. Gibson does not identify the factual basis
    upon which the claim is advanced, but rather states that he has reviewed trial
    counsel's file, the disclosure that was made and has taken note of certain
    matters. On cross-examination, he conceded that there were aspects of the file
    that raised questions for him but that without speaking to trial counsel or the
    appellant he was unable to say whether a particular issue exists.</span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant's
    main argument on this issue is that the plea agreement form signed by him was
    deficient in that it failed to explain specifically that he was waiving the
    right to a <i>jury</i> trial and waiving the
    right to test specific areas of the Crown's case.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no merit
    in this claim. The consent signed by the appellant specifies that he consents
    to entering a guilty plea and that he understands both that he is giving up his
    right to a trial in which the Crown must prove that he is guilty beyond a
    reasonable doubt and the right to cross-examine witnesses. The appellant has filed
    no evidence to establish that he did not understand that he was waiving the
    right to a jury trial or that
    he would have done anything differently if he had known. Moreover, no evidence
    has been filed to demonstrate that the appellant had any arguable defence. In
    the absence of such evidence, there is simply no air of reality to the
    appellant's claim of incompetence of counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal is
    therefore dismissed.</span></p>
