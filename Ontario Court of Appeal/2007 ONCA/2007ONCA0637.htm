  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Bemrose and Mr. Fetter were married in
    1987.  In 2000, after 13 years of
    marriage, they separated.  They have
    three children: Rebecca, Elijah and Isaiah.  Prior to trial and after some 13 court appearances, the parties resolved
    custody and access issues.  However, a
    trial was required in order to settle the financial matters that divided them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial took place in January 2003.  Both parties were self-represented at
    trial.  The most crucial determination
    that the trial judge was required to make, for the purpose of establishing
    child and spousal support, was the parties’ respective incomes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge reserved her decision.  Approximately four months after trial, she
    released model reasons for decision.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  They were detailed, careful, thoughtful and
    solidly grounded in the evidence.  They
    contained all the necessary findings of fact and decided all of the
    issues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An order reflecting the trial determinations was
    issued on April 11, 2003 (the “trial Order”).  Pursuant to its terms, Mr. Fetter was to pay $248 per month in child
    support plus 56.4% of the children’s extraordinary expenses and $450 per month
    in spousal support.  The trial Order
    stipulated that no review of spousal support could be initiated until at least
    three years after the date of the trial Order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No appeal was taken from the trial Order.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Fetter, an ordained minister, had two
    sources of income: his employment income from the church that he served, and
    honoraria for performing weddings and funerals.  The usual honorarium was $200 per service.  The trial judge found his annual income from
    honoraria to be $2,500.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some months after the trial Order had been
    issued, Mr. Fetter discovered that the financial statement which his accountant
    had prepared for trial was inaccurate because, through inadvertence, it
    understated his income from honoraria.  He called Ms. Bemrose and asked to meet with her.  When they met, he told her that a mistake had
    been made about the number of funerals he had performed, and he gave her
    $1,000.  He promised to pay any
    additional amount owing once he knew exactly how much money had not been
    accounted for.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Bemrose took the view that Mr. Fetter had
    perjured himself at the trial.  In
    January 2005, she brought a motion to vary the trial Order by increasing child
    and spousal support.  The motion sought
    to have the increases made with retroactive effect to 2001 (the “Motion”).  In the Motion materials, Ms. Bemrose stated
    that the reason for bringing the Motion was that, at trial, Mr. Fetter
    “knowingly gave false testimony about his income” on which the trial judge
    relied.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The hearing of the Motion took place on June 13
    and 14, 2005, and November 21, 2005.  It
    led to seven endorsements and three orders.  By order dated September 16, 2005, the motion judge dismissed the Motion
    to the extent that it had been brought on the grounds of fraud and
    mistake.  However, he granted the Motion
    on the basis that there had been a change in circumstances from July 1, 2004.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge reduced the annual income of
    $40,000 imputed to Ms. Bemrose by the trial judge to $20,000.  This change was given retroactive effect to
    July 1, 2004.  As a consequence, Ms.
    Bemrose’s imputed income for 2004 was $30,000 and for 2005 it was $20,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By order dated May 11, 2006, the motion judge
    held that Mr. Fetter’s income for 2004 and 2005 was $86,600.  He determined this figure by adding imputed
    income arising from the clergy residence deduction to Mr. Fetter’s actual
    income.  In so doing, he used a different
    method than the one that had been employed by the trial judge.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result of these orders (the “Motion
    Orders”), Mr. Fetter was ordered to pay substantially increased child and
    spousal support effective January 1, 2004.  Specifically, he was ordered to pay child support of $820 per month in
    2004 and $923 per month beginning in 2005 and an increased share of the
    children’s s. 7 special expenses.  Spousal support was increased to $1,300 per month, effective January 1,
    2004.  In addition, Mr. Fetter was
    ordered to secure his spousal support obligation with a $100,000 life insurance
    policy.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a later order, Mr. Fetter was ordered to pay
    Ms. Bemrose costs of $10,000 (the “costs Order”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Fetter appealed the Motion Orders and seeks
    leave to appeal the costs Order.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Fetter
    moved for a stay of the Motion Orders pending appeal.  By order dated November 23, 2006, this court
    granted the stay and ordered him to pay $650 per month in spousal support and
    $771 per month in child support, pending further order of the court (the “Stay
    Order”).    </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Fetter’s salary for 2002-03 was
    $56,800.  Of that sum, $38,000 was base
    salary and $18,000 was a housing allowance.<a

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Bemrose asked the court to find that Mr.
    Fetter was deliberately underemployed.  She pointed to his 2001 income of $68,350, which was $11,550 higher than
    the salary he was then earning.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected this argument.  She found that the marriage breakdown and
    resulting stress led to Mr. Fetter’s medical leave and consequent loss of
    employment.  As well, the parties had
    agreed that he should remain in the region to assist in raising the
    children.  In light of those factors, and
    in the absence of evidence that he would be likely to receive more than his
    current income even if he were to seek employment in another church in the
    region, she found his then-current salary to be the proper basis on which to
    determine support.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The honoraria that Mr. Fetter received for
    performing weddings was paid by the church and recorded on his T4 slips.  The honoraria that Mr. Fetter received for
    performing funerals was usually paid by the funeral home, although he was
    occasionally paid directly by the family of the deceased.  After considering Mr. Fetter’s honoraria
    income over the years leading up to trial, the trial judge found that Mr.
    Fetter was unlikely to receive more than $2,500 per year of honoraria
    income.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the clergy deduction
    of $14,400 was worth an additional $4,800 in disposable income to Mr. Fetter
    and she deemed that to be additional income.  Adding the deemed additional income of $4,800 to his salary of $56,800
    and honoraria income of $2,500, the trial judge found his income for child
    support purposes to be $64,100.  </p>

    to the court about Ms. Bemrose’s income contained serious discrepancies.  For example, Ms. Bemrose maintained that she
    earned a gross income of $43,656 in 2001; however, her T-4 showed a gross
    income of $60,442 for that year.  The
    trial judge also observed that questions had been raised about the level of
    business expenses that Ms. Bemrose claimed in respect of her income.</p>

    the trial judge found that Ms. Bemrose would have no difficulty in finding work

    reflected that each had primary custody of one child and that custody of the
    third child was shared.  This agreement

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge dismissed the Motion to the
    extent that it had been brought on the basis of perjury.  In this regard, the motion judge held that
    the discrepancies in income did “not come close to the standard of deliberate
    deceit, ‘fraud’ or ‘perjury’”.  Rather,
    the motion judge found, they were the result of poor record keeping and the
    stress of the separation and ensuing litigation.  The motion judge concluded that the case was
    no different than thousands of others and “[I]f this case resulted in a reopening
    of an order made after a trial, no family law trial decision would ever be safe
    from attack.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge also dismissed the Motion
    insofar as it alleged that the trial judge had made a mistake in the
    calculation of the clergy residence deduction.  That he said, was a matter for an appellate court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He granted the Motion on the basis of a material
    change in circumstances beginning July 1, 2004.  He gave three reasons for this determination.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first reason related to Ms. Bemrose.  The motion judge began by finding no evidence
    that Ms. Bemrose’s health had declined after the trial Order was made.  However, he stated that she had provided
    evidence of job search efforts and of the decline in Canadian religious
    publication editing opportunities.  He
    noted that over two and a half years had elapsed from the time of trial to the
    time of writing of the reasons with Ms. Bemrose’s qualifications “becoming
    staler and her job experience becoming sparser.”  This, he said, was “neither foreseen nor
    foreseeable, according to the trial decision.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge stated that the expectation of
    the trial judge that Ms. Bemrose could earn $40,000 was “no longer
    tenable”.  He went on to say:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Nevertheless, the mother is an educated and
    articulate woman who would be an asset in all manner of office, clerical or
    even retail jobs.  She remains highly
    employable, though perhaps not in her chosen field.  It is time for her to re-evaluate and
    consider other options.  But I do find
    that there has been a material change in that she has not been able to realize
    the income imputed to her at trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He then imputed a reduced annual income of
    $20,000 to Ms. Bemrose, beginning July 1, 2004.  As a consequence, Ms. Bemrose’s imputed income was $30,000 for 2004 and
    $20,000 for 2005.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, although Mr. Fetter’s income in 2003 was
    found to be little different than it had been in 2002, the motion judge found
    that his income had “materially” increased, starting in January of 2004.  For 2004, Mr. Fetter’s annual total income
    was $72,000, including honoraria received for performing weddings and funerals
    but without allowing for the benefit of the clergy residence deduction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge adopted a different method for
    determining the value of the clergy residence deduction.  Rather than using the “cash in hand” method
    employed by the trial judge, the motion judge calculated the amount of gross
    income that a taxpayer would have to earn in order to have the same net
    disposable after-tax income as Mr. Fetter.  On that basis, he imputed an annual income of $86,600 to Mr.
    Fetter.  He also ordered that Mr.
    Fetter’s gross income for child support purposes was to be based on this
    approach to the clergy residence deduction from 2004 forward.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the motion judge stated that it had been
    “agreed” that there had been a change of residence for Elijah as of January 1,
    2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge then ordered Mr. Fetter to pay
    substantially increased spousal and child support, with effect from January 1,
    2004.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When determining costs, the motion judge held
    that because Ms. Bemrose had unsuccessfully alleged that Mr. Fetter had been
    fraudulent, Mr. Fetter was entitled to a full indemnity for that portion of the
    proceedings that related to the fraud allegations.  However, since Ms. Bemrose had been
    substantially successful in obtaining the relief she sought, the motion judge
    awarded her substantial indemnity costs for the remaining part of the
    proceedings before him in the amount of $10,000.     </p>

    betterment”, and (2) for the purposes of the stay motion, had provided the

    proffered evidence.  It consists solely
    of Ms. Bemrose’s long, rambling affidavit which is filled with hearsay,
    sweeping statements and allegations of improper behaviour on the part of Mr.
    Fetter.  There is nothing to substantiate
    the statements contained in the affidavit.  It covers time periods before and after those covered by the orders
    under appeal.  It raises matters which
    appear to have little, if anything, to do with the matters in issue on
    appeal.  No attempt is made to relate the
    information to the matters in issue on appeal.  Even if admissible, information of this sort presented in this way is

'>[7]</span></span></span></a> even on
    that basis, I do not find the proposed fresh evidence meets any component of
    the test.  As it is largely a recitation
    of information of the same general nature as that which was before the lower
    courts, I do not accept that it is “fresh”.  On this record, it is not surprising that Elijah may have expressed
    misgivings about living at his father’s home or that he may be frequently
    staying at his girlfriend’s home.  Elijah’s frequent change of residence was well-known to both the trial
    judge and the motion judge.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, given that little, if any, attempt is

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The credibility of the evidence is called into
    question by its rambling nature, the failure to relate the information to the
    legal issues, a rehashing of matters that have been the subject of factual
    determinations made in prior legal proceedings and the general nature of the
    broad and unsubstantiated assertions against Mr. Fetter.  For example, Ms. Bemrose asserts that there
    are more than 40 changes in Mr. Fetter’s financial statement dated December 24,
    2006, from that which he filed in June of 2006.  However, she does not set out any of the changes, indicate why the
    changes are significant or explain how this information is relevant to this
    appeal  Given that a person’s financial
    situation will change in a six-month period, it is to be expected that updated
    financial statements will be different from those that predate them.  The variations appear to be either minor or
    the result of updating and not an attempt to mislead the court.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are two themes evident in the proffered
    evidence about Elijah.  First, it
    suggests that Mr. Fetter is improperly manipulating and pressuring Elijah to
    live with him so that Mr. Fetter can enjoy financial benefit.  Second, it discusses Elijah’s living
    arrangements, demonstrating that he moves residence from one parent to another,
    is conflicted about the moves, is now living some of the time at his
    girlfriend’s home and is uncertain about where he may go to university in the
    fall.  </p>

    made (the “review period”) and the review period had not elapsed at the time
    the Motion was heard, the motion judge did not have jurisdiction to order a

    the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd
    Supp.), c. 3, the motion judge had jurisdiction to order a variation in spousal
    support on the basis of a material change in circumstances before the review
    date.  Section 17(4.1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>17(4.1)  Before the court makes a variation order in respect of a spousal support
    order, the court shall satisfy itself that a change in the condition, means,
    needs or other circumstances of either former spouse has occurred since the
    making of the spousal support order or the last variation order made in respect
    of that order, and, in making the variation order, the court shall take that
    change into consideration.</p>

    to take place until three years after the date of the trial Order.  It does not purport to oust the court’s
    jurisdiction to vary spousal support nor, in my view, could it.  Section 17 of the <i>Divorce Act </i>creates a mechanism for varying support orders and
    gives parties the right to apply for a variation in prescribed
    circumstances.  While the trial Order
    could set a period during which spousal support could not be reviewed, it
    cannot (and does not purport to) take away the parties’ right to apply for a
    variation.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    a change in circumstance: a “material” change in Mr. Fetter’s income beginning
    on January 1, 2004; a change in Elijah’s residence; and, a change in Ms.
    Bemrose’s financial situation.  With
    respect, in my view, the motion judge erred in finding that those reasons met

    Fetter’s income did not change “materially” from the time of trial to the time
    the Motion was heard.  At the time of

    year.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

    trial, as an ordained minister, ranged from $55,205 to $68,350.  At the time of the Motion, he was an ordained
    minister with an annual income of $72,000.  Mr. Fetter was performing the same job, with only a modest increase in
    income.  When that increase is considered
    in light of the pattern of income identified by the trial judge, I do not view
    it as material nor can it be said to be a change that if known, would have
    resulted in different terms.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears to me that the motion judge found a
    material increase because of the income he imputed to Mr. Fetter based on the
    clergy residence deduction.  However, as
    I explain below, in the circumstances of this case, it was not open to him to
    depart from the methodology that had been used by the trial judge.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge also relied on a change in
    Elijah’s residence when determining there had been a material change in
    circumstance.  Throughout the litigation
    between these parties, all judges have been aware that Elijah’s residence has
    alternated between his parents’ homes.  Their orders reflect this arrangement.<a

    to reside with the respondent was a matter which was fully known to the trial
    judge, even if Elijah were residing with Ms. Bemrose at the time of the Motion,
    that fact could not be relied on as the basis for a variation in spousal
    support.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would add that, in any event, it is unclear
    whether Elijah was residing with Ms. Bemrose at the time of the Motion.  In a consent order dated May 2, 2005, it was
    stated that Elijah’s primary residence “shall be” with Ms. Bemrose.  However, while the record is unclear, it
    appears that the consent order was made without prejudice to Mr. Fetter’s right
    to argue the matter of Elijah’s residence at the Motion.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No such determination was made.  Rather, it appears that the motion judge
    assumed that Elijah was residing with the respondent.  This may have flowed from his apparent
    misunderstanding of the trial Order.  The
    trial Order was based on the notion that one child lived with each parent and
    the third child split his time between the parents.  However, at para. 9 of the reasons dated
    August 8, 2005, the motion judge recites that the trial Order was predicated on
    the father paying support for two children and the mother paying support for
    one child.   </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears to me that there was no change in Ms.
    Bemrose’s situation that had not been contemplated by the trial judge.  The trial judge found that Ms. Bemrose had
    not been disadvantaged by the marriage.  In fact, she found that Ms. Bemrose had benefited from the marriage in
    terms of education and employment.  The
    trial judge found Ms. Bemrose to be intentionally unemployed.  Spousal support was ordered only because of
    Ms. Bemrose’s debts and medication needs.  It is important to note that Ms. Bemrose’s position at trial was that
    she needed to seek out a career change for various reasons, including the
    decline in religious publishing opportunities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found no change in Ms.
    Bemrose’s health.  Like the trial judge,
    he noted that she was highly employable.  He referred to the decline in religious publication opportunities but
    that was no different than the situation that existed at trial.  Indeed, it was the express reason given by
    Ms. Bemrose at trial as to why she needed a career change.  As at trial, Ms. Bemrose was unemployed.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While Ms. Bemrose’s employment situation
    remained unchanged, the motion judge found that she had made reasonable efforts
    to find employment and that it was not foreseen at trial that Ms. Bemrose would
    be unable to find employment.  This is
    different than the situation at trial where the trial judge found that Ms.
    Bemrose had made no efforts to find work as she had chosen to focus instead on
    readying herself for the trial.<a href="#_ftn15"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a fundamental level, it seems to me that the
    motion judge’s finding cannot stand largely because of the way in which the
    Motion unfolded.  Ms. Bemrose brought the
    Motion on the basis that Mr. Fetter had perjured himself at trial or that the
    trial Order was the result of a mistake.  Those were the grounds set out in the pleadings.  Numerous court appearances and various other
    motions went on during the same time that the Motion was pending or being
    heard.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span

    statements were filed and served in those other motions.  But, the fact remains, Mr. Fetter understood,
    based on the pleadings, that the Motion was based on a claim either that he had
    perjured himself at trial or that the trial Order was the result of a
    mistake.  Mr. Fetter says he was
    blindsided by the finding at the Motion of a change in circumstances.  He was not aware that the Motion could be
    decided on the basis of a change in circumstances and maintains that he was
    entitled to proper notice and the opportunity to lead evidence in respect of
    the various alleged changes.   I
    agree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears that the Motion was brought pursuant
    to Rule 15(7) of the <i>Family Law Rules </i>as
    Family Law Rule 15 applies to motions to change final orders or agreements<i>.  </i>Rule
    15(7)(f) requires that the details of the change asked for and the changed
    circumstances that are grounds for the change be disclosed.  The change of circumstances as found by the
    motion judge was not listed in the Motion materials as a basis for the Motion.  Thus, it is entirely understandable that Mr.
    Fetter approached the Motion on the grounds that had been pleaded – perjury or
    mistake.  The financial issues that arose
    appear to flow out of other motions.  Mr.
    Fetter understood that the financial issues to be raised on the Motion related
    to the (minor) inaccuracies in his trial financial statements.  He recognized and accepted that child support
    was to be recalculated when there were changes to his income.  That, however, is not the same thing as
    understanding that he was facing a claim that spousal and child support were to
    be changed due to a material change in circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consider then the evidence before the motion
    judge of Ms. Bemrose’s efforts to find employment.  Other than one bare assertion in an affidavit
    that she had “recently” applied for a number of positions but was not
    considered for them, I could find nothing in the record to support the finding
    that reasonable efforts to find employment had been made after the trial.  Given that Mr. Fetter did not understand that
    this matter was up for consideration at the Motion, it is readily apparent why
    there was no challenge to the bald assertion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This shifting of grounds, blending of evidence
    from various motions and proliferation of documentation likely also explains
    the issue raised by that part of the Motion Order which requires the appellant
    to secure the spousal support payable with life insurance.  There was no term to this effect in the trial
    Order.  That relief had not been sought
    in the notice of motion or supporting documents filed by the respondent on the
    Motion.  The appellant says that he was
    never aware that the motion judge was contemplating making such an order nor
    was he given an opportunity to address the matter.  Even if such relief is routinely ordered in
    conjunction with spousal support orders, if it has not been sought, it ought
    not to be ordered, at least without first giving the other side the opportunity
    to speak to the matter.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, it was not open to the
    motion judge to find a change in Ms. Bemrose’s circumstances.  The issue of imputed income was <i>res judicata </i>and her imputed income
    remains at $40,000 per year.</p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>                        Conclusion on Spousal

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In light of my conclusion that there was no
    material change in circumstances, the motion judge did not have jurisdiction to
    vary spousal support.  Consequently, I
    would set aside those parts of the Motion Orders that vary spousal support and
    restore the relevant parts of the trial Order.  This means that spousal support of $450 per month was payable from
    January 1, 2003, forward, with the exception of the period covered by the Stay
    Order, during which period spousal support was $650 per month.  Further, in accordance with the trial Order,
    spousal support was to be indexed annually.  In addition, either party may apply to the court to have the spousal
    support order reviewed because the review period has elapsed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the financial situations of the
    parties and the endless litigation since trial make the notion of a review
    highly unattractive.  However, having
    determined that the terms of the trial Order in respect of spousal support are
    to prevail, it is inappropriate to “pick and choose” among those provisions and
    the review provision remains.  I
    anticipate that if and when such a review is undertaken, the motion judge will
    conduct it with due regard to the findings of the trial judge as to the
    parties’ respective abilities to obtain employment and against a backdrop of
    realistic goals and expectations for both parties.             </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would add a final comment.  Even if the threshold for a variation had
    been met, it was incumbent on the motion judge to consider the appellant’s
    ability to pay when determining the quantum of spousal support.  The Motion Orders increased monthly spousal
    support from $450 to $1,300.  They also
    significantly increased the appellant’s child support obligations.  As the Motion Orders were made with
    retroactive effect, they instantly created significant arrears for the
    appellant.  On the record, the Motion
    Orders far exceed the appellant’s ability to pay.  His financial statements show no equity and
    significant debt.  His evidence
    demonstrates that he has no ability to borrow further funds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was incumbent on the motion judge to consider
    not only Ms. Bemrose’s need but also Mr. Fetter’s ability to pay.  Although the motion judge stated that he had
    looked at the “condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the parties
    and children”, I see no mention of the appellant’s ability to pay.  Further, I see no explanation for how or why
    $1,300 per month was an appropriate quantum of spousal support.  Both failures, in my view, are errors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In light of my conclusion on spousal support,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only other issue raised in the context of
    spousal support that has not been addressed relates to the method employed by
    the motion judge when imputing income to the appellant based on the value of
    the clergy residence deduction.  As the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the Motion, Mr. Fetter offered to pay
    increased child support for 2002 based on additional income of $5,400 from
    performing funerals.  Accordingly, the
    motion judge found Mr. Fetter’s 2002 income for purposes of calculating child
    support was $69,500 - $64,100 as found by the trial judge plus $5,400 additional
    income.  No appeal is taken from this
    finding and it remains effective.      </p>

    motion judge as to Mr. Fetter’s actual income in the years that follow.  By actual income, I mean the income that Mr.
    Fetter received from employment, by way of housing allowance and from honoraria
    for weddings and funerals.  Those
    findings remain undisturbed.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues, however, that the doctrine
    of <i>res judicata</i> governs the method to
    be used when calculating the imputed income to be attributed to him as a result
    of the clergy residence deduction.  He
    maintains that in re-litigating this issue on a variation motion, the
    respondent was permitted to launch a collateral attack on the trial
    decision.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept the appellant’s submission on this
    matter.  As no appeal was taken from the
    trial Order, the method for determining the amount of income to be imputed as a
    result of the clergy residence deduction was <i>res judicata</i>.  Consequently,
    the motion judge lacked jurisdiction to adopt a different method for
    calculating the value of the clergy residence deduction when determining Mr.
    Fetter’s income for the purposes of child support.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result, for the purposes of calculating
    child support, the amount of income to be imputed to Mr. Fetter based on the
    clergy residence deduction ought to be calculated in accordance with the method
    employed by the trial judge, rather than that of the motion judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having said that, I wish to add that in the
    circumstances of this case, I see no error in the approach of the trial
    judge.  The reason for my view lies in
    the fact that when the trial judge was deciding the respective incomes of the
    parties, they each enjoyed special tax deductions.  Mr. Fetter was entitled to a special
    deduction in relation to the clergy residence income but, from the record, it
    appears that Ms. Bemrose was entitled to other special tax deductions because
    of the type of work that she performed and because it was performed in the
    home.  Both parties took exception to the
    way in which the other accounted for the special tax advantages of the
    other.  In those circumstances, it
    appears that the trial judge was attempting to treat “apples like apples”.  That is, she realised that both parties had
    more after-tax money as a consequence of the special tax deductions that they
    were entitled to take.  Having recognized
    that, she made what she determined was an appropriate adjustment to the
    appellant’s income by increasing it by the amount which the deductions
    increased his disposable income.  In
    light of the evidence before the trial judge that both parties made
    approximately similar amounts of gross income and both had the right to take
    special deductions, it was open to the trial judge to have imputed no
    additional income to Mr. Fetter because she added no imputed income to Ms.
    Bemrose for her special deductions.  Thus, I see no unfairness in the trial judge’s approach or the result of
    that approach in the circumstances of this case.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I wish to respond to Ms. Bemrose’s
    argument that because the trial judge gave no reasons to explain the method
    that she used to calculate the value of the clergy residence deduction, the
    motions judge was entitled to adopt his own approach.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While I accept that the trial judge did not fully
    articulate how she derived the figure of $4,800 as the value of the clergy
    residence deduction for 2002, I do not agree that she gave no reasons to
    explain the method that she employed.  On
    a full reading of the reasons, it is apparent that the trial judge imputed
    income based on the additional cash-in-hand that Mr. Fetter would have with
    which to pay support as a result of claiming a clergy residence deduction of
    $14,400.  At para. 16 of the reasons, the
    trial judge states that the clergy deduction of $14,400 would “likely be worth
    an additional $4800 <i>in disposable income
    to him” </i>[emphasis added].  Moreover,
    she states that “ … it doesn’t follow that his income must be automatically
    grossed up by the value of his housing allowance”, making it clear that she
    rejected the gross-up approach.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, for the purposes of child support, Mr. Fetter’s income for 2002 is,
    for the reasons already given, $69,500.  Thereafter, Mr. Fetter’s income is to be his actual income, as found by
    the motion judge, plus the value of the clergy residence deduction calculated
    in accordance with the “cash in hand” method used by the trial judge.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    explained above in the section on spousal support, I am of the view that the
    motion judge lacked jurisdiction to revisit the issue of the income to be
    imputed to Ms. Bemrose.  Consequently, in
    accordance with the trial Order, for the purposes of determining child support,
    an annual income of $40,000 is to be imputed to Ms. Bemrose.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Child
    support for the years 2003 and 2004 is to be in accordance with the assumption
    of the trial judge, namely, that one child resided with each of the parties and
    the third child moved between their residences.  In light of the order dated May 2, 2005, of Ferguson J., to the effect
    that Elijah’s primary residence was with Ms. Bemrose and as that order had
    effect commencing January 1, 2005, child support from January 1, 2005 to June
    of 2006, when the Motion was heard, is to be calculated on the basis that two
    children had their primary residence with Ms. Bemrose and one child had her
    primary residence with Mr. Fetter.  Thereafter, child support is to be calculated on the same basis as at trial,
    namely, that one child resided with each parent and the third child lived
    equally with both.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i>In
    my view, it is preferable to restore the decision of the trial judge on this
    matter for the following reasons.  As
    discussed above, the state of Elijah’s residence was apparently to be decided
    at the Motion.  It was not.  The parties continue to argue about where he
    lives and for how long.  The assumption
    that Elijah lives equally with both parents reflects the lengthy history of
    Elijah moving between the two homes.  In
    fact, a fair reading of the record suggests that from the time of separation
    until today, Elijah has moved between the two homes and the parties have agreed
    that he should be free to do so.  This
    assumption also attempts to minimize the impetus to manipulate Elijah.  It also should minimize return trips to the
    courthouse which would be required if support were to be re-adjusted each time
    Elijah moves house.  <i></i></p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>            Section 7 Expenses</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge made many determinations as to the children’s s. 7 special
    expenses over a number of years.  I see
    no basis on which to interfere with those determinations and they remain
    effective. However, the parties are to pay their proportionate shares of such
    expenses based on their incomes calculated in accordance with these reasons. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>THE COSTS ORDER </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Mr. Fetter has been successful on appeal, it follows that the costs Order ought
    to be set aside.  Consequently, I need
    not decide the issues that he has raised in relation to the propriety of that
    order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    said that, some comments on the costs Order are warranted.  Although appellate courts are to afford
    deference to costs awards because of their discretionary nature, I find the
    costs Order in favour of Ms. Bemrose to be troubling.  When Mr. Fetter learned that one small aspect
    of the financial information which he had provided to the trial court was
    inaccurate, he immediately disclosed the same to Ms. Bemrose.  After volunteering that information, he
    attempted to remedy the problem by giving Ms. Bemrose $1,000 and committing to
    pay any additional sum found to be owing once the accounting had been
    rectified.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the trial judge’s finding that honoraria income from both weddings and
    funerals was $2,500 per year and, as there was no question about the
    reliability of the information about honoraria income from weddings, a payment
    of $1,000 seems eminently reasonable in the circumstances.  The ultimate determination that the
    understatement of income was $5,800 over a two-year period bears that out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    actions taken by Mr. Fetter in relation to this matter ought to be encouraged
    by the courts.  It was right that he
    disclose the mistake, once he was aware of it.  It was right that he attempt to immediately compensate Ms. Bemrose for
    the effect such an error would have on child support.  The steps that he took ought to have
    minimized or eliminated the need for recourse to the courts.  However, instead of resolving matters, his
    disclosure led to the Motion being commenced by Ms. Bemrose.  The Motion was argued over three days which
    spanned a three-month period and followed countless related court
    appearances.  The magnitude of the Motion
    material is disclosed in the motion judge’s reasons for decision dated March
    21, 2006, in which he states that with the filing of the parties’ costs
    submissions, there were 36 volumes of material totalling over 4000 pages before
    him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    an ordained minister, Mr. Fetter was particularly vulnerable to the allegation
    of perjury.  He had no choice but to
    respond and defend himself.  He was fully
    exonerated - the motion judge dismissed the Motion, insofar as it had been
    brought on the allegation of perjury, and made the finding that the claim of
    fraud was “unreasonable (not just unsuccessful, but quite untenable for lack of
    proof)”.   Despite that finding, the respondent
    continued to allege, in the material that she filed on costs of the Motion,
    that Mr. Fetter was attempting to deceive the court.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span

    the light of these factors and the strained financial circumstances of both
    parties, it appears to me that even if Ms. Bemrose had been successful, she
    ought to have been denied her costs on the basis of Rule 24(4) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>.  Rule 24(4) provides that a successful party
    who has acted unreasonably may be deprived of costs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    made those observations, in setting costs here and below, I am mindful of the
    fact that one and sometimes two of the children reside with Ms. Bemrose and, as
    her actual income comes solely from support, their standard of living may well
    be affected by such an award.  At the same
    time, this consideration is tempered by the finding of the trial judge that Ms.
    Bemrose has the ability to find lucrative employment; the fact that she has
    failed to obtain employment ought not to be used as a reason to reduce the
    costs to which the successful party is entitled.     </p>

    understand that the quantum of child and spousal support that Mr. Fetter has
    paid may exceed that which this appeal has determined he was obliged to
    pay.  Although this possibility was
    briefly alluded to at the oral hearing of the appeal, the question of how any
    overpayment ought to be dealt with was not argued.  If the parties are unable to resolve this
    matter between themselves, they are directed to take the appropriate
    proceedings in the Family Court to have the matter addressed.          </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would grant leave to appeal the costs Order, allow that appeal and set aside
    the costs Order.   Mr. Fetter is entitled
    to costs of the Motion and this appeal.  For the reasons already given, I would fix those costs at $15,000 for
    the Motion and $10,000 for the appeal.  Both such amounts are inclusive of GST and disbursements.  To reduce hardship to Ms. Bemrose, I would
    not require her to pay the costs forthwith.  Instead, I would order that Mr. Fetter may set off the costs against his
    spousal support obligations.  I trust
    that the parties can negotiate a reasonable method for setoff.  </p>

    constitute a material change in circumstances:  <i>Trewin v. Jones </i>(1997), 32
    O.R. (3d) 225 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  However, as I have explained, the
    circumstances of this case are materially different from those in cases such as <i>Trewin</i>, especially as it was foreseen
    at trial that employment was dependent on seeking work outside the religious
    publishing field.   </p>

    was heard on June 13 and 14, 2005, and November 21, 2005.  </p>

    motion for security for costs and in the fresh evidence motion.  As these matters took place after the costs
    Order was made, they are not relevant to the propriety of the costs Order,
    however.  </p>
