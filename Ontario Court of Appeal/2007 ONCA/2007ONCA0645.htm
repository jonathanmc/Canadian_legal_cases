style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was convicted of production of
    marijuana, possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and
    possession of marijuana, contrary to ss. 7(1), 5(2) and 4(1), respectively, of
    the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19.  She
    was also convicted of theft of electricity contrary to s. 326(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  The charges related to a
    marijuana grow operation in a rural area of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>At
    the commencement of trial the appellant admitted that there was a marijuana
    grow operation inside her residence at the time.  She also admitted that the residence had been
    modified to accommodate the grow operation and that there were 1,121 plants and
    a hydro theft that exceeded the value of $5,000.  </span>The appellant, nevertheless, denied
    that she was involved in the grow operation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>T</span>he
    appellant also challenged the issuance of the search warrant on a house she
    owned that housed the grow operation.  In
    addition, she and her co-accused challenged the manner of the warrant’s
    execution on the basis that the police failed to knock and seek permission to
    enter before breaching the front door of the dwelling and entering.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge dismissed the challenge to the
    search warrant but accepted that the failure to knock and seek permission
    constituted a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Canadian</i> <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  She concluded, however, that exclusion of the evidence would bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute.  She therefore admitted the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence constituted the bulk of the Crown’s
    case against the appellant.  The
    appellant was convicted and sentenced to a period of fifteen months’
    incarceration, along with restitution in the amount of $10,000 to Hydro One,
    probation for a one-year period, and a weapons prohibition.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police investigation in this case began
    sometime in January 2002 because of an investigation into another marijuana
    grow operation that involved a residence owner by the name of Nguyen (not the
    appellant).  <span lang=EN>It had become apparent to the police that out-of-area
    individuals and groups were purchasing residential properties of patterned
    description for use as marijuana grow houses.  A search of surnames, including Nguyen, at the registry office revealed
    the name of the appellant and the subject property. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Further
    investigation revealed that the appellant had recently opened a hydro account
    and provided an alternate telephone number in the 416 area code.  It also revealed that during the first
    forty-three days of her account there was an average daily use of hydro greater
    than that for similar houses.  The police
    viewed this as being consistent with a house being used as a marijuana grow
    operation.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Visual
    surveillance of the appellant’s house and property was carried out by the
    police.  A neighbour of the property
    advised the police of their personal observations.  These observations, in a community where
    “everybody knows everybody”, included such things as: no one had ever been seen
    outside the property; a grey van had been parked in the driveway; there was
    always a light on in the living room area; windows were always drawn; and the
    mailbox was never checked and garbage never put out.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police conducted more surveillance of the
    outside of the property.  The grey van
    and a Honda were observed and a police check revealed that the Honda was
    registered to one of the defendants who lived in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North
    York.  Another neighbour of
    the residence advised the police that the grey van and Honda frequently were
    observed on the property and generally confirmed the observations of the first
    neighbour. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further surveillance by the police revealed that
    the grey van had a non-functioning tail-light.  The non-functioning tail-light provided the basis upon which the police
    stopped the van and proceeded with a traffic investigation.  They learned that the appellant was the
    driver and that the only passenger was a male whom the appellant said was her
    father.  She lied to the police and told
    them she was coming from a beach in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This background formed the basis upon which the
    police obtained a search warrant for the subject property.  The warrant was valid from 8:00 p.m. July 30,
    2002, to 11:00 p.m. August 1, 2002.  The
    police executed the warrant at 9:18 p.m. on July 30<sup>th</sup>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The front entrance was locked so the lead
    officer instructed that the door be forced open with a battering ram.  There was no knock and notice given of police
    presence before doing so.  The search
    revealed that two of three bedrooms were being used to grow marijuana.  One contained marijuana plants; the other was
    fitted with lights, fans and ventilation generally used in marijuana grow
    operations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was located huddled in a corner of
    the basement.  The appellant’s purse
    contained keys for the grey van and the Honda, as well as an address book with
    a list of fertilizers suitable for growing marijuana.  The appellant, as I previously noted, denied
    that she was involved in the grow operation. </p>
  <h2>ISSUE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sole issue on the appeal against conviction
    is whether the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence found at the
    appellant’s home pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  She also seeks
    leave to appeal her sentence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On my review of the record, the trial judge’s
    decisions respecting the admission of the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> are not unreasonable.  As a result, I would dismiss the appeal
    against conviction.  Furthermore, I
    cannot conclude that the sentence imposed by the trial judge amounts to either
    an error in principle or is unfit in that it is outside the acceptable
    range.  I would therefore also dismiss
    the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(1)       The
    Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> requires that in deciding whether or not evidence obtained
    through a breach of the <i>Charter</i> should be excluded at trial, a court is to determine whether, “having regard to
    all the circumstances, the admission of it … would bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute”.  To determine
    disrepute a court is to weigh three factors: (i) the admission of the evidence
    on the fairness of the trial, (ii) the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violation, and (iii) the effect of excluding the evidence
    on the administration of justice: <i>R. v.
    Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='
color:black'>This court will defer to a trial judge’s ruling under s. 24(2)
    unless there is an identifiable error in principle, a material misapprehension
    of the evidence relevant to the ruling, or a clearly unreasonable conclusion.&nbsp;  It is in these circumstances that this court
    may perform the s. 24(2) calculation afresh and determine the admissibility of
    the evidence:&nbsp;<i>R. v. </i><i>v.&nbsp;Harris</i>,&nbsp;2007 ONCA 574 at
    para. 50.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant makes four submissions, which she
    says constitute errors made by the trial judge in her decision to admit the
    evidence found at the appellant’s home pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  She asserts that the trial judge erred:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         In holding that there was uncertainty in
    the law;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         In her analysis of the seriousness of
    the breach;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         In finding that the police acted in
    good faith; and,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.         In holding that the appellant was exploiting
    the <i>Charter</i> and thereby mitigating in
    favour of admitting the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before proceeding to address the appellant’s
    submissions, I believe it will be helpful to briefly describe the “knock and
    notice” principle that is at the heart of this appeal.</p>
  <h2><i>The “Knock and Notice” Rule</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court of Canada in<i> Eccles v. Bourque</i>, <span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>[1975] 2 S.C.R.
    739</span>, <span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>19 C.C.C. (2nd)
    129</span> at 133 - 34, set out the following principle:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><i>Except in exigent circumstances, the police
    officers must make an announcement prior to entry</i>.  There are compelling considerations for
    this.  An unexpected intrusion of a man’s
    property can give rise to violent incidents.  It is in the interests of the personal safety of the householder and the
    police as well as respect for privacy of the individual that the law requires,
    prior to entrance for search or arrest, that a police officer identify himself
    and request admittance. … In the ordinary case police officers, before forcing
    entry, should give (i) notice of presence by knocking or ringing the doorbell,
    (ii) notice of authority, by identifying themselves as law enforcement officers
    and (iii) notice of purpose, by stating a lawful reason for entry.  Minimally they should request admission and
    have admission denied although it is recognized there will be occasions on
    which, for example, to save someone within the premises from death or injury or
    to prevent destruction of evidence or if in hot pursuit notice may not be
    required. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This common law principle has become known as
    the “knock and notice” rule.  For the
    purposes of drug cases, the rule has since been supplemented by s. 12 of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>,
    which provides that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For the purpose of
    exercising any of the powers described in section 11, a peace officer may</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>enlist such assistance as the officer deems
    necessary; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)       use as much force as is necessary in the
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This section permits the police to enter a home
    with a certain degree of force, without announcing their presence, in exigent
    circumstances, where there is a need for officers to act and enter without
    giving prior notice.  These circumstances
    include when there is a fear for the safety of persons within the premises and
    concern for the destruction of evidence, as well as, at times, concern for the
    officer's own safety: <i>R. v. Lau</i>, 175
    C.C.C. (3d) 273 at para. 31 (B.C.C.A.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant does not contend that the
    admission of the evidence in this case would negatively affect trial
    fairness.  It is uncontested that the
    evidence seized in this case is properly classified as non-conscriptive
    evidence.  Thus, the appellant’s
    submissions are directed to factors (ii) and (iii) of the <i>Collins</i> test.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With this brief summary, I will turn to the
    submissions of the appellant and I will address them in the order set out
    above.</p>
  <h2><i>Uncertainty in the Law</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the trial judge was
    in error when she held that there was uncertainty in the law regarding the
    knock and notice principle when executing a search warrant on a dwelling.  I disagree with the basis of this submission;
    in my view, the trial judge made no such holding. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argued before the trial judge that <i>Lau, supra,</i> and <i>R. v.</i> <i>Schedel</i> (2003), 175
    C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.), made no change in the existing law respecting the
    application of s. 24(2) and the apparent automatic exclusion of evidence in the
    circumstances of no “knock and notice”.  The
    trial judge disagreed and, as I will explain,  merely observed that if evidence gathered in
    violation of the “knock and notice” rule were always excluded, then this would
    conflict with the recognized fact that s. 24(2) jurisprudence is “uncertain” in
    that there are no “bright lines” to warn the police about how to act in a given
    situation.  She noted that it would
    ignore the law that applies where: (i) the police rely on a valid warrant; (ii)
    the object of the search was “real evidence” and not “conscripted”; and (iii)
    the search was for drugs and drug paraphernalia. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The comment about “uncertainty in the law” does
    not come from the trial judge in this case, but rather it arises out of
    comments made by Esson J.A. in <i>Schedel</i>.  His view of uncertainty was in connection
    with the evolution of the common law knock and notice rule as it has been
    modified from time to time by legislation, such as the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>.  He observed at para. 49 that in a substantial
    number of past cases where the search and seizure was based on a formal police
    policy, it was either held not to be in breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> or, if in breach, not serious
    enough to justify exclusion of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After reviewing <i>Lau</i> and <i>Schedel</i> at some
    length, the trial judge then restated the appellant’s position, as she
    understood it, on the s. 24(2) issue.  Once again, that position appears to be that in relying on these cases
    and their impact on the state of the law, any breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> in connection with a dwelling
    house that does not include a knock and notice results in an automatic
    exclusion of the evidence.  The trial
    judge then made the following observation at para. 50 of her decision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At the very least,
    exclusion would purport to make clear what Esson J.A. recognizes in paragraph
    77 [in <i>Schedel</i>] quoted above, that “the
    law itself is uncertain and frequently changes.”  It would also be contrary to the “one
    relatively reliable factor” he cites.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “one relatively reliable factor” she
    referred to was Esson J.A.’s note, also at para. 77 of <i>Schedel</i>, that “the law as it has developed seems rarely to result
    in exclusion where: (a) the police relied upon a valid warrant; (b) the object
    of the search was ‘real evidence’ and not ‘conscripted’; and (c) the search was
    for drugs and drug paraphernalia.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, the trial judge was saying that
    to rely on the appellant’s submission, would be to allow one fact to determine
    a multi-faceted analysis, and that because a s. 24(2) analysis is fact-driven
    means that one must consider all of the circumstances rather than focus on the
    knock and notice rule to the exclusion of everything else.  I do not read anything more than that in the
    trial judge’s reference to uncertainty in the law and in my view she made no
    error in doing so.</p>
  <h2><i>Seriousness of the Breach and Good Faith</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A number of factors are engaged under an
    analysis of the seriousness of the breach, including whether the breach was
    committed in good or bad faith.  Other
    factors include the obtrusiveness of the search, the individual’s expectation
    of privacy in the area searched, and the existence of reasonable grounds.  Consequently, in connection with the listed
    errors the appellant claims the trial judge made, I will address two and three
    together because they are closely related. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the trial judge did not make any specific
    finding that the police acted in good faith, she also did not make a finding of
    bad faith.  Her reasons nevertheless
    strongly suggest that she viewed the police conduct as <span style='color:black'>amounting</span> to good faith.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given that this case involves a dwelling house,
    which usually gives rise to a serious <i>Charter</i> breach, the appellant seems to argue that the added feature of an absence of
    “knock and notice” and no exigent circumstances must result in an absence of
    good faith.  Thus — again relying
    primarily on <i>Lau</i> — the appellant says
    that the trial judge could not have found good faith and that this, by itself,
    means that the breach is so serious as to require its exclusion.  Again, I would disagree. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that in <i>Lau</i> the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that in the
    circumstances of that case, entry without “knock and notice” on the basis of a
    policy was unreasonable such that it constituted a breach of section 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, it is important to appreciate that <i>Lau</i> was a case where the police had a
    formal policy of no knock and notice, which the police followed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The view
    of the court in <i>Lau</i> regarding such a
    policy was that s. 12 of the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i> does not permit the formulation of a blanket
    policy for searches under s. 11 of the Act (para. 39).  Thus,
    the court concluded that, in the specific circumstances “… once the
    trial judge concluded that there were no exigent circumstances, it was not open
    to him to find good faith on the part of the police” (para. 38).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span
style='color:black'>Lau</span></i><span style='color:black'>, therefore, does not
    stand for the principle that where there is no knock and notice and no exigent
    circumstances, a court cannot find good faith.  <i>Lau</i> should be read in the
    context of the specific facts of that case.  In my view, <i>Lau</i> is clear in
    this regard when the reasons are read as a whole.  For example, in para. 39 the court holds
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[E]ach case must be
    considered independently.  … [The police]
    based their decision to enter the premises in the manner that they did on a
    policy which, contrary to the [<i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>], requires surprise entries with respect to every
    marijuana grow operation (unless the police know children or old people are
    present) without regard to the circumstances which prevail in the situation at
    hand.  Good faith cannot be founded on a
    policy which is made contrary to the dictates of the legislation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, in <i>Lau</i>,
    the evidence was not excluded under s. 24(2) merely because there was no knock
    and notice; rather, the evidence was excluded since:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[41] The violation
    occurred because the actions of the police were based on a policy which was
    contrary to existing legislation.  …
    There was no evidence in this case that the police officers had misunderstood
    the provisions of s. 12 [of the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>].  There was
    no evidence that they considered it at all.  <i>For that reason</i> the breach
    must be considered flagrant and the evidence excluded.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is a completely different case.  As
    noted, the trial judge in this case found that the decision of whether
    or not to use the knock and notice entry was made case by case, and not on the
    basis of a police force policy.  She
    found that the police here — unlike in <i>Lau</i> — did not rely on a police policy to always use surprise entries.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='
color:black'>  The law regarding the
    factor of police misconduct resulting in a <i>Charter</i> violation is not simply
    one of good faith or bad faith.  Rather,
    police misconduct is to be placed on a continuum for the purposes of assessing
    the seriousness of the conduct: see </span><i><span
style='color:black'>Harris</span></i><span style='color:black'>,&nbsp;<i>supra</i>, at para. 62</span><span
style='color:black'>.&nbsp; That
    continuum includes conduct between that of a good faith error and a blatant
    disregard for constitutional rights:&nbsp;see <i>R. v. Kitaitchik</i> (2002),
    166 C.C.C. (3d) 14 at 26-27 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).&nbsp; Here, the trial
    judge’s opinion can be fairly interpreted to mean that she viewed the police
    conduct as falling considerably nearer the good faith end of that continuum.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In concluding her reasons for her decision the
    trial judge remarked about the need for caution regarding criminal activity
    being designed to frustrate the administration of justice.   She expressed the view that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[E]xploitation of <i>Charter</i> rights is the purpose for
    setting up indoor marijuana hydroponics operations in structures that were
    built to be used as houses.  To exclude
    the evidence would be to allow those who do so to outfox the administration of
    justice.  In some circles that might be
    described as disrepute.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> requires
    that all of the circumstances in each case be considered including those
    described above and whether the evidence was essential to the prosecution, as
    well as the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its
    commission.  The trial judge, after
    considering all of the relevant factors, concluded that the administration of
    justice would be brought into disrepute by excluding the evidence in the
    circumstances of this case.  </p>

    concluding observations to any overriding degree in reaching her decision.  The trial judge’s concluding observations
    simply reflected a concern for preserving the integrity of the administration
    of justice through the correct application of s. 24(2) <i>Charter</i> principles.  To the extent it can be said
    that she did rely on them, it is of no consequence in the circumstances of this
    case.  Her comments would not have
    negated the factors that she did rely on in favour of admission of the

    be rare, even for a first offender”.  The
    appellant argues that, as a first time offender, this is one of the rare cases
    where a conditional sentence is appropriate.  The trial judge disagreed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This was a large scale marijuana grow
    operation.  The warrant yielded 1,121
    plants and 18 pounds of harvested marijuana.  As well $10,000 of electricity was stolen during the operation.  The trial judge determined that these
    circumstances required the need for denunciation and general deterrence that
    could not be achieved through a conditional sentence.  She was entitled to do so.  This is not one of the rare cases. </p>

    increasing prevalence of this form of offence in the local community and the
    danger caused by the hydro by-pass: see <i>R.
    v. Nguyen, Khuong Van</i>,<i> </i>[2002]
    O.J. No. 2480 (C.J.); varied on other
    grounds, [2002] O.J. No. 5490 (C.A.).  It
    is important to note that trial courts have observed that there is an
    increase in large-scale marijuana grow operations with accompanying violence
    and threats of violence that courts must respond to.  For example, see <i>R. v. Nguyen, Manh Hung</i>,<i> </i>[2006] O.J. No. 1607 (C.J.). </p>
