    the City of Toronto (the “City”) had the authority under s. 150(2) of the<i> Municipal Act</i>, 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 25
    to pass a by-law prohibiting commercial parking lots and businesses that
    perform parking enforcement services from issuing private parking tickets to
    vehicles parked without the parking lot owner’s consent.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Municipal Parking Corporation (“MPC”) is a
    business that provides parking enforcement services to private property owners
    such as shopping malls, strip plazas and apartment buildings. Like other
    similar businesses, one of MPC’s enforcement techniques in relation to alleged
    parking violators is issuing common law damage claims in the form of private
    parking tickets. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On July 22, 2004, the City enacted By-Law
    725-2004 (the “2004 Amending By-Law”). Amongst other things, the 2004 Amending
    By-Law amended the City’s licensing regulations in relation to businesses that
    operate commercial parking lots or that perform parking enforcement services by
    prohibiting the issuance of any form of demand for payment relating to
    unauthorized parking other than a parking infraction notice under Part II of
    the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to the City, the 2004 Amending By-Law
    was a response to misleading and abusive forms of private parking enforcement
    and was authorized under s. 150(2) of the<i> Municipal Act, 2001</i>, which permitted the City to exercise its licensing
    powers for the purpose of consumer protection.<a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to MPC, the 2004 Amending By-Law
    exceeded the scope of the City’s then existing licensing powers and was no more
    than a cash grab by the City that deprived private property owners of their
    lawful entitlement to compensation from trespassers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On May 23, 2006, Stewart J. quashed the 2004
    Amending By-Law, holding that it was <i>ultra vires</i> of the City’s licensing
    powers. In particular, she found that trespassers who park on private property
    without the property owner’s consent do not fall within the definition of
    “consumer”, and that the true purpose of the 2004 Amending By-Law is not
    therefore consumer protection. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently, on January 5, 2007, the
    application judge ordered that the City pay to MPC the sum of $90,000.00 on
    account of costs on a partial indemnity scale inclusive of disbursements and
    G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City appeals from the application judge’s
    decision, arguing that the application judge erred by applying an overly
    restrictive interpretation of the term “consumer protection” as it appeared in
    s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>.
    The City also seeks leave to appeal the application judge’s costs award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    term “consumer protection”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to submitting that the application
    judge’s interpretation of “consumer protection” was correct, MPC relied on
    several grounds for finding the by-law invalid that were raised on its
    application but not determined by the application judge. At the appeal hearing,
    the City challenged MPC’s right to rely on s. 2(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> in the absence of a cross-appeal. Further, MPC
    acknowledged that several of the grounds it relied on raised factual issues
    that could only be determined on a new hearing. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, MPC asked this court to uphold the
    application judge’s ruling based on two grounds that it claimed could be
    considered by this court as pure questions of law: i) is the by-law invalid
    because it conflicts with the provisions of the <i>Trespass to Property Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21 and with s. 100 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>;<i> </i>and
    ii) is the by-law invalid because it improperly delegates to the Chief of
    Police the power to regulate communications between private property owners and
    persons trespassing on their property. Having considered these grounds, I have
    concluded that they raise issues that were not fully explored on appeal. In the
    circumstance, I would allow the appeal, set aside the application judge’s order
    and remit all of the issues that were not dealt with by the application judge
    to the Superior Court.</p>

    or occupant. Sections 915-3 to 915-6 provide for the removal of vehicles parked
    in contravention of the by-law. Section 915-7 creates a <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> offence of parking in violation of the
    by-law. It also stipulates that the owner of the vehicle is guilty of the
    offence even though the owner was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of

    Part II of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>.
    In addition to police officers and parking enforcement officers employed by the
    Toronto Police Services, PINs can be issued by municipal law enforcement
    officers (“MLEOs”). MLEOs are persons authorized to enforce municipal laws and

    that operate commercial parking lots or that perform parking enforcement
    services. Like many other categories of businesses, these businesses are
    required to obtain a business licence from the City under the terms of the
    City’s licensing by-law. The City’s business licensing by-law is contained in
    Chapter 545 of the Toronto Municipal Code. The types of businesses that are
    required to obtain a business licence are listed in s. 545-2 of the Toronto

    factors as rendering the 2004 Amending By-Law invalid. The sole issue addressed
    by the application judge was whether the 2004 Amending By-Law was invalid
    because it did not fall within the power to license for consumer protection
    purposes set out in s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i> (which was the
    stated basis relied on by the City for enacting the 2004 Amending By-Law). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As already noted, the application judge found
    that trespassers who park unlawfully on private property do not fall within the
    definition of “consumer”, and that the true purpose of the 2004 Amending By-Law
    is not therefore consumer protection. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge began her reasons by
    referring to MPC’s practice of issuing “parking violation notices”. She said,
    “[f]or the purposes of this application, I find that these notices markedly
    resemble the appearance of official municipally issued parking tickets and are
    so designed.” However, the application judge also noted that the effect of the
    2004 Amending By-Law would be to direct all revenues from private parking
    enforcement to the City. She said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under the By-Law
    Amendment, only licensed PPEAs that employ MLEOs may issue demands for payment
    on private property. MLEOs are not entitled to enforce any common law property
    rights, including the law of trespass, or rights pursuant to the <i>Trespass to
    Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T. 21. Significantly, all of the revenue from
    PINs issued by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto employees and by MLEOs is
    to be paid to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.
    Neither the owner of the property on which the improper parking has taken
    place, nor the agency employed by the owner to enforce its parking prohibition
    or restrictions, will receive any payment or compensation through this process.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In reaching her decision, the application judge
    referred to the fact that “[u]nder the [licensing provisions] of the
    predecessor <i>Municipal Act</i>, a wider public interest jurisdiction was
    conferred”. She noted that there was some indication in the legislative debates
    that the intent of the Legislature was apparently “to streamline rather than to
    expand municipal licensing powers” and concluded that “[b]y specifying a finite
    list of enumerated categories… the Legislature intended a more focussed scope
    of municipal jurisdiction to regulate commercial activity.” </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the application judge also acknowledged
    the recent trend in Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence of recognizing “the
    important role of municipal legislators as elected representatives of the
    community and away from a restrictive approach to the interpretation of
    municipal powers.” In addition, she referred to the need for a “broad and
    purposive approach” leading to a “more generous interpretation of municipal
    powers”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addressing the specific interpretation issue,
    the application judge noted that “consumer” is not defined in the <i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i>. She referred to the definition of consumer in Black’s Law
    Dictionary, 7th ed. (St. Paul: Westgroup 1999), namely, “[a] person who buys
    goods or services for personal, family, or household use…” She said: “[e]ven
    when read in the context of this licensing scheme, ‘consumer’ must necessarily
    be held to refer to one who ‘consumes’ or seeks to consume the goods or service
    offered by the licensee.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge said she was unable to see
    “how trespassers who unlawfully park on private property are consuming any
    product or service of the regulated business or how they may be considered
    consumers in the commonly understood and accepted definition of the word.” She
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>           
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Toronto, by enacting the impugned By-Law

    transform a demand for compensation by way of damages for trespass due to
    unlawful parking into a consumer relationship and thereby prohibit certain
    business practices which it may deplore.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            In my opinion, where a person has in
    the absence of any contractual relationship, unlawfully parked a vehicle on
    private residential or commercial property, the person cannot be considered to
    be a “consumer” in the commonly accepted meaning of the word. It is therefore
    evident from the terms of the By-Law Amendment itself and the history of its
    enactment that its real purpose does not fall within the ambit of consumer
    protection.</p>

    appears in s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001 </i>when she concluded that

    of municipal    enabling legislation. As
    stated by this court in <i>Croplife v. City of Toronto</i> (2005), 75 at para.

    rather than considering the meaning of the term “consumer protection” within
    the context of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>,
    as a whole, she focussed inappropriately on one commonly understood meaning of
    the term “consumer”. In <i>Sullivan and
    Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Toronto: Butterworths, 2002), the author
    cautions against undue reliance on dictionary definitions. She says that
    relying too heavily on dictionary definitions:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>encourages interpreters to treat statutory
    interpretation disputes as disputes about the meaning of individual words. The

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my opinion, the modern approach to statutory
    interpretation requires me to interpret the phrase “consumer protection&quot;
    as it appears in s. 150(2) of <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, by considering it in
    the overall context of enabling legislation that permits municipalities to
    “license, regulate and govern” businesses. Importantly, apart from certain
    specific exclusions, there is no restriction in s. 150 on the nature of the
    businesses that may be licensed. Considered in this context, in my view, a
    broad purposive approach suggests that “consumer” would include those persons
    and entities with whom a licensee transacts, engages or deals directly as part
    of carrying on its licensed business activities. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this regard, I note that another and broader
    definition of the word “consumer” than that adopted by the application judge,
    is found in Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd ed. (New York: Random House,
    1999): “a person or organization that uses a commodity or service.” Further,
    another commonly understood meaning of “consumer” is “an individual acting for
    personal, family or household purposes and … not includ[ing] a person acting
    for business purposes”: <i>Consumer Protection Act</i><i>, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c.30, Sch. A, s. 1, in force July 30, 2005. See
    also s. 1 of the <i>Consumer Reporting Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, C.33, in which
    “consumer” is defined as meaning “a natural person but … not includ[ing] a
    person engaging in a transaction, other than relating to employment in the
    course of carrying on a business, trade or profession”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the context of enabling legislation
    empowering municipalities to “license, govern and regulate” a wide range of
    businesses, it seems to me that a broad and generous construction of the term
    “consumer protection” in s. 150(2) indicates that it extends to any person with
    whom a business transacts, engages or deals directly. In relation to commercial
    parking lots and PPEAs, this would include persons whom a particular business
    alleges have parked without consent and to whom the business has issued a
    demand for payment of common law damages. Although “consumer protection” may be
    restricted to persons not acting for business purposes in relation to their
    dealings with the licensee, it is unnecessary that I decide that issue in order
    to resolve the issues on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to the application judge’s conclusion,
    in my view, the recipients of a demand for payment of common law damages are
    not trespassers. Rather, they are <i>alleged</i> trespassers from whom the
    business engaged in parking enforcement is seeking to extract a payment. More
    importantly however, the recipients of such a demand are the individuals with
    whom the commercial parking lot or PPEA transacts, engages or deals directly in
    carrying out their business. </p>

    2001</i>, as it stood on July 22, 2004 that the term “consumer” in s. 150(2)
    should be restricted to persons and entities who <i>buy</i> goods or services
    or who consume or seek to consume goods or services <i>offered</i> by the
    licensee. In my view, by limiting the interpretation of “consumer” in this way,
    the application judge overlooked the overall objective of the enabling
    legislation (providing municipalities with appropriate power to protect
    individuals not acting for business purposes in their dealings with businesses)
    and focused inappropriately on one commonly understood meaning of the word
    consumer. </p>

    judge was correct in looking to the “public welfare” power in the predecessor
    legislation and in concluding that the Legislature intended a more focused
    scope of municipal jurisdiction than that which previously existed. The
    respondent says that a broad interpretation of the term “consumer” will
    eradicate the distinction between the public interest power in the predecessor
    legislation and the consumer protection power in s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal
    Act</i><i>, 2001</i>. This is particularly
    so in the municipal parking context where it is the public at large that uses
    the parking facilities. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reject these submissions. Even if the
    Legislature intended a more focused and streamlined set of municipal powers in
    enacting s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, the issue at hand is the
    proper interpretation of the term “consumer protection” as it appears in that
    section. For reasons that I have already explained, in my view, the term
    consumer extends to any person with whom a business transacts, engages or deals
    directly. In the context of the 2004 Amending By-Law, it is not the public at

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>BY-LAW No. 725-2004</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>To amend City of
    Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 545, Licensing, respecting the requirements for
    private property enforcement agencies undertaking parking enforcement
    activities.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>WHEREAS Section
    150 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, grants local municipalities the
    authority to license, regulate and govern any business wholly or partly carried
    on within the municipality for purposes of health and safety, consumer
    protection and nuisance control; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>WHEREAS members
    of the public have complained to the Toronto Police Service, City staff and
    City Council concerning the abusive and misleading parking enforcement
    practices used by private property enforcement agencies and commercial parking
    lot operators, including the issuance of “look-alike” parking tags and
    invoices, the imposition of inflated and unjustified administrative fees or
    “fines” and the sanctioning of abusive collection practices; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>WHEREAS there is
    no meaningful way in which the public can appeal the validity of these tags,
    invoices or collection notices, or the amount of the “administrative fees”
    charged by these companies; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>WHEREAS the
    Toronto Police Services has expressed its concern that there is an inherent
    conflict or interest where persons undertaking enforcement activities have a
    direct financial interest in the amount and collection of invoiced amounts and
    administrative penalties, and that this leads to abuses which have the effect
    of eroding and undermining public respect for legitimate law enforcement
    particularly with respect to the enforcement of City by-laws regulating parking
    on private and municipal property; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>WHEREAS Council
    has therefore decided, in the interests of consumer protection, that the only
    effective remedy for eliminating these abuse practises is to restrict persons
    undertaking parking enforcement activities or providing parking enforcement
    services as defined in Chapter 545, Licensing, to the issuance of parking
    infraction notices under Part II of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, a Toronto Police Service tow card and other documents, as
    approved by the Chief of Police;</p>
