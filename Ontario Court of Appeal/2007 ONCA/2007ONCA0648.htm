style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In essence, the trial judge concluded that, on
    the initiative and persistence of the appellants, who were defendants in a
    lawsuit brought by the law firm’s clients as plaintiffs, the appellants met
    with the plaintiffs to the lawsuit in the absence of counsel and agreed to
    settle their outstanding action.  Since
    the trial judge found that the parties colluded in arriving at the settlement for
    the purpose of defeating the law firm’s claim for its outstanding fees of $105,647.98,
    he found the appellants jointly and severally liable for the law firm’s fees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal challenges both the findings of the
    trial judge and his application of the law to those findings.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants, John Howard Teskey, Vacation
    Brokers Inc. and Ridings Financial Brokers Inc. (collectively referred to as
    the Teskey Group) were the defendants in a claim referred to as the Kymbo
    action.  That action was instituted by
    Kymbo International Inc., Kymbo Canada Inc., and Roman Gura Sr. and Roman Allan
    Gura (collectively referred to as the Gura Group).  The action involved a multimillion dollar
    claim and counterclaim in which the parties accused each other of various
    breaches arising out of their respective roles in a time-share vacation
    business.  Although the Teskey Group was
    represented in the Kymbo action, its lawyer was suspended from practice in the
    days leading up to the events at issue.  The plaintiffs were represented by the respondent, Gardiner Miller
    Arnold LLP (GMA), principally through Mark Arnold.</p>
  <h2>Grounds of appeal </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the trial judge erred because
    he made no specific finding that Mr. Teskey knew that the Gura Group owed fees
    to GMA at the time of the settlement and in finding that the purpose of the
    settlement was to defeat those fees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants also argue that the trial judge
    impermissibly considered the merits of the Kymbo action, something he told
    counsel that he would not do.  As well,
    they argue that the trial judge’s finding that the settlement was not
    commercially reasonable was unsupported by the evidence. </p>
  <h2>The trial reasons </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before considering the issues raised by the
    appellants, it is helpful to review the reasons of the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To arrive at his result, the trial judge
    considered the parties’ positions in the Kymbo action at the time of the
    settlement to determine whether the settlement, which on its face provided for
    no exchange of money between the two Groups, was “commercially
    reasonable”.  His review considered the
    conduct of the parties in the Kymbo action, particularly their conduct during
    the period of October 6 to 14, 2004 – the period when the settlement was
    reached.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge noted the following events.  On Thursday, October 6, Mr. Teskey phoned Mr.
    Gura Sr. to suggest they meet in the absence of counsel to discuss a
    settlement; Mr. Gura Sr. did not agree.  On Friday, October 8, Mr. Teskey called Mr. Gura Sr. again.  On Saturday, October 9, during another
    telephone call, the parties agreed to meet on Sunday, October 10.  At that meeting, the parties reached an
    “agreement in principle”.  On Monday,
    October 11, the parties spoke again.  On
    Tuesday, October 12, Mr. Teskey prepared and faxed a proposed offer to settle
    to the Gura Group.  On Wednesday, October
    13, the Gura Group communicated its acceptance of that offer.  Finally, the Teskey Group executed the offer below
    the signatures of the Gura Group indicating that the Kymbo “claim and
    counterclaim is now fully settled … as reconfirmed by the below [Teskey]
    signatures”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The proposed terms of settlement provided for
    the dismissal of the claim and counterclaim and for the transfer of all
    documents to the Teskey Group, including all membership documentation and all
    promissory notes, which had a face value in excess of $1 million U.S.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>   The offer specified that the Gura Group
    would pay no money to the Teskey Group; however, it was silent on whether the
    Teskey Group would pay any money to the Gura Group.  The offer also provided for the dismissal of
    the action without costs, that the parties would bear their own costs, and that
    any costs orders outstanding would be nullified.  Finally, the offer required both Groups to
    keep the terms of the settlement confidential.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In considering whether the acceptance of these
    terms amounted to an agreement to unfairly defeat GMA’s accounts, the trial
    judge considered the context in which the settlement was reached and whether the
    “walk-away” settlement described in the agreement was commercially credible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this issue, the trial judge noted that, as
    recently as October 4, the Gura Group had instructed GMA to submit an offer to
    settle providing that the Teskey Group pay the Gura Group $500,000.  This offer was less than the Gura Group’s
    earlier offer to settle for $650,000.  Mr.
    Gura Sr. was reluctant to agree to the new offer because he thought the amount was
    too low.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the reasonableness of the settlement, the
    trial judge also considered the opinion of the Gura Group’s expert chartered
    accountant, David Burkes, that the Gura claim against the Teskey Group was
    worth more than $1.2 million.  The trial
    judge also noted that, at the time of the settlement, the Gura Group had an interlocutory
    injunction in its favour requiring the Teskey Group to hold $400,000
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    in trust
    for the Gura Group, which was granted on evidence that the Teskey Group had
    recovered that amount from vacation time-share customers by redirecting
    payments away from Kymbo.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was also cognizant that, while
    the Teskey Group had obtained an order against the Gura Group for security for
    costs based on the Guras’ individual bankruptcies and Kymbo’s lack of assets in
    Ontario, the quantum of those costs had not been determined pending the release
    of a reserved decision on final injunctive relief, which the Gura Group was
    optimistic about winning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Additionally, at the time of the settlement, the
    Gura Group had expressed no loss of confidence in GMA’s representation.  Indeed, days before the settlement, the Gura
    Group expressed no wish to negotiate with Mr. Teskey Sr., whom Mr. Gura Jr.
    described as a “snake” who had devastated their business.  As well, the Guras had instructed Mr. Arnold to
    write counsel for the Teskey Group specifically confirming that Mr. Teskey “is
    to have no communication directly with my clients.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the meantime, on Friday, October 8, counsel
    for the Teskey Group was no longer responding to communications.  GMA learned that day that the Teskey Group’s
    counsel had been suspended by the Law Society of Upper Canada.  The trial judge found that this information
    did not come to Mr. Teskey’s attention until Wednesday, October 13. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the Gura Group uncharacteristically did not
    respond to Mr. Arnold’s telephone calls at the beginning of the week of October
    11, he became concerned that the Groups were negotiating in his absence.  On October 13 at 9:43 a.m., Mr. Arnold faxed
    Mr. Teskey notifying him that GMA would commence legal proceedings against the
    Teskey Group to recover the amount of any outstanding account with the Gura
    Group if the parties to the litigation reached a direct settlement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later that day, GMA obtained a charging order
    and a solicitor’s lien against any settlement proceeds.  Mr. Arnold faxed the charging order to the
    Teskey Group between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m.  At 5:44 p.m., GMA received a communication that a new law firm was now
    acting on behalf of the Gura Group.  At
    6:16 p.m., the Gura Group faxed its acceptance of the offer to the Teskey
    Group.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During October 13 and 14, the Gura Group obtained
    all signatures required to accept the Teskey offer and the Teskey Group
    (apparently thereafter) “reconfirmed” the settlement by signing the offer below
    the signatures of the Gura Group.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In making his factual findings, the trial judge
    rejected the evidence of Mr. Gura Jr., Mr. Gura Sr. and Mr. Teskey.  He accepted the evidence of Mr. Arnold,
    including admissions by the Guras to Mr. Arnold, that Mr. Teskey made a
    settlement payment to the Guras.  As
    well, he accepted the evidence of Mr. Burkes and Mr. McClogan, both of whom
    were independently retained by the Gura Group to give litigation support.  In particular, the trial judge accepted that
    Mr. Gura Sr. had made separate admissions to these two witnesses that the
    Teskey settlement included a payment to the Gura Group, but that “no one would
    find [the money]” and “no one would ever know” about the payment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded that Mr. Gura Sr.
    entered into “secret negotiations” with Mr. Teskey on October 10, 2004 and that
    the Gura Group and the Teskey Group “reached an agreement … which was
    subsequently reduced to writing and executed on October 13 and 14, 2004.”  He found that the Teskey Group “was aware of
    the Charging Order before the settlement was consummated” and that it had made
    a secret payment to the Gura Group.  He determined
    that the Groups’ evidence that the Teskey Group paid nothing for the settlement
    defied commercial common sense for several reasons, which I will discuss later
    in these reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the trial judge concluded that the two
    Groups:</p>

    matter in secret and that they colluded to ensure that the settlement was
    documented in a way that would not reflect any financial consideration being
    paid by the Teskey Group to the Gura Group.  The settlement defies commercial reality.  It is a settlement that the Gura Group could
    have achieved by simply walking away from the action.  The settlement did not have to be done in
    secret, without informing counsel.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this basis, the trial judge applied the law
    that was put forward by counsel.  In
    particular, the trial judge applied <i>Dicarllo
    v. McLean</i> (1915), 33 O.L.R. 231(S.C. (A.D.)), in which Middleton J.
    explained two potential avenues for liability:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The cases fall
    into two distinct classes.  If a
    solicitor has a lien upon the proceeds of litigation for his costs, and gives
    notice of that lien to the opposite party, and after such notice money is paid
    over to the client, the Court will, in general, upon motion, compel the party
    paying to pay the solicitor's costs. ... </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The other class of
    cases is where upon the facts it is shewn that the parties have acted
    collusively. In this case, the defendant renders himself liable to pay the full
    amount of the solicitor's bill, his liability being in no way limited to the
    amount paid to the plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, GMA did not rely on the first avenue,
    although relief may have been available on that basis.  Instead, GMA focussed on collusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The law was not at issue.  The trial judge applied the <i>Dicarllo</i> principle based on the earlier
    authority of <i>Price v. Crouch</i> (1891), 60
    L.J.N.S. Q.B. 767, which held that collusion denotes “an agreement
    between two parties, with the knowledge that they are doing an unfair thing in
    depriving a third party of a right he had”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, the trial judge asked himself
    whether the Teskey Group had notice of GMA’s claim, whether the Teskey Group had
    agreed to make or had made a payment to the Gura Group, and whether there was
    an agreement between them to deprive GMA of the fees to which it was entitled.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since the trial judge answered these three
    questions in the affirmative, he held the Teskey Group to be jointly and severally
    liable for GMA’s costs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the finding of collusion, and in
    accordance with the principle set out in <i>Dicarllo</i>,
    it was unnecessary for the trial judge to determine the quantum of the
    settlement payment made by the Teskey Group to the Gura Group.  On this appeal, counsel sought to argue for
    the first time that the remedy for collusion is unfair and that the court should
    revisit the law as set out by this court in 1915.  This issue was not challenged at trial and
    was not appropriately raised on appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I will proceed to consider the

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the finding of
    collusion cannot stand because the trial judge made no specific finding that
    the Teskey Group <b>knew</b> the Gura Group
    owed fees to GMA at the time it reached the settlement.  Further, they argue that the trial judge
    erred in finding that the <b>purpose</b> of
    the settlement was to defeat GMA’s claim.</p>
  <h2><i>(1)</i> <i>Knowledge</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, if not explicit, it is implicit in
    the trial judge’s reasons that he was satisfied the Teskey Group knew of the
    Gura Group’s financial obligations to GMA.  That information was known by Mr. Teskey when he negotiated the
    “agreement in principle” on October 10, discussed the settlement with the Gura
    Group on October 11, prepared the offer to settle on October 11 and 12, and
    executed the offer to settle (by which time he was also in receipt of GMA’s
    charging order).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The finding of knowledge is supported by a
    number of circumstances that combine to lead inevitably to the necessary
    inference that the Teskey Group had knowledge of the outstanding accounts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, it is apparent that the Groups discussed legal
    fees when negotiating the settlement.  The draft offer to settle makes no less than four references to costs by
    providing that (i) the parties’ respective claims would be dismissed without
    costs; (ii) the Divisional Court proceedings would be dismissed without costs;
    (iii) any outstanding or pending costs orders<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> would be
    nullified; and (iv) that all parties would bear their own legal costs.  Accordingly, the question of costs and legal
    charges was considered both at the time the settlement was negotiated and when
    it was reduced to writing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the Teskey Group would have been alive
    to the issue of GMA’s costs because the terms of the October 5 offer
    specifically stipulated that the $500,000 settlement payment was payable to GMA
    in trust and further provided that the parties would bear their own costs.  Mr. Teskey would have appreciated this
    direction was needed to protect GMA’s fees because Mr. Teskey was an
    experienced litigant who acknowledged that he had “been involved in more than a
    hundred litigations before the court.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, while Mr. Teskey gave evidence at the
    trial that the Guras did not tell him on October 10 about any outstanding
    accounts to GMA, and that in any event, he believed the Gura Group to be
    financially strong, the trial judge rejected his evidence generally, which
    included this evidence.  The rejection of
    Mr. Teskey’s evidence is supported by the fact his trial evidence was
    inconsistent with the affidavit he filed just a few months before the
    settlement on his motion seeking security for costs from the Gura Group.  In that affidavit, which was filed as an
    exhibit at trial, Mr. Teskey relied on the bankruptcies of the individual Guras
    and the inadequacy of Kymbo’s assets in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  He knew that the Gura Group was financially
    strapped. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, Mr. Teskey used the Gura Group’s
    financial difficulties as a bargaining chip during the negotiations.  According to Mr. Gura Sr., Mr. Teskey told
    the Guras at the October 10 meeting that the Teskey Group had funds to continue
    the litigation for years, but queried where the Gura Group would find the money
    to see the litigation to its conclusion, which Mr. Teskey estimated would cost
    $500,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, taken together, this evidence was
    more than sufficient to support a finding that the Teskey Group knew about GMA’s
    outstanding fees on October 10.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, even if this evidence was not clear, the
    parties only arrived at an “agreement in principle” on October 10 and on
    October 11 continued their discussions.  As
    well, the terms of the settlement, which were somewhat complex, were not
    reduced to writing until October 12.  Interestingly, Mr. Teskey incorporated those terms not into minutes of
    settlement, which may have suggested a pre-existing agreement, but rather into
    an offer of settlement, which implies that a settlement had not yet been
    concluded.  Moreover, even after the Gura
    Group accepted the offer, the Teskey Group felt the need to counter-sign the offer
    to signify its agreement.  By that time,
    and even before the Gura Group completed its signatures, the Teskey Group knew
    about the charging order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I see no basis on which to
    interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the Teskey Group had knowledge
    of the Gura Group’s debt to GMA at the time of settlement.  </p>
  <h2><i>(2) Purpose</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, even accepting that the Teskey Group
    knew about the outstanding GMA accounts, the appellants argue that there was no
    evidence to support a finding that a purpose of the settlement was to defeat
    GMA’s claims.  Again in my view, a
    finding of purpose is both explicit and implicit in the trial judge’s reasons.  Not only did the trial judge specifically find
    “purpose” because Mr. Teskey entered into a “secret deal”, but he reiterated
    that finding in his reasons for refusing to reopen the trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In coming to this conclusion, the trial judge
    relied on the inference to be drawn from the Groups’ conduct in keeping both
    the settlement and the payment secret.  In
    other words, if the Groups took steps to keep the terms of the settlement and
    payment secret, they must have done so for the purpose of defeating GMA’s accounts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants, however, argue that the
    settlement was not secret but, instead, that it was expeditiously communicated
    to GMA and promptly followed by the Gura Group’s retainer of new counsel.  For several reasons, this argument is not
    supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, Mr. Teskey persisted in seeking a direct
    meeting with the Guras in the absence of their counsel.  Mr. Teskey provided alternative explanations
    for this, namely, it was either because Mr. Arnold refused to meet with him in
    the absence of his lawyer or because the Teskey Group’s counsel had been
    suspended from practice.  Neither of
    these explanations survives scrutiny. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before the settlement meeting, Mr. Teskey
    requested a meeting among himself, Mr. Arnold, and the Guras in the absence of
    Mr. Teskey’s lawyer.  Mr. Arnold properly
    explained that this was inappropriate because Mr. Teskey was represented by
    counsel.  Thus, Mr. Teskey knew he could
    not meet with Mr. Arnold as long as he was represented by counsel.  Accordingly, if Mr. Teskey no longer had
    counsel – and he claimed that he knew his lawyer was suspended – then he also
    knew there was no impediment to meeting with Mr. Arnold and the Guras.  Significantly, Mr. Teskey no longer sought
    such a meeting.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, the trial judge found as a fact
    that Mr. Teskey did not learn about his lawyer’s suspension until October 13,
    three days after the October 10 meeting.  Since he believed himself to be represented, clearly Mr. Teskey wanted to
    meet with the Guras in the absence of any lawyers and presumably with the
    intention of not informing the lawyers about the meeting.  This intention is reflected in Mr. Teskey
    contacting the Guras directly, even though he had specific instructions not to
    do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In either event, the trial judge was entitled to
    describe the meeting as one that was kept “secret” from the lawyers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the secrecy of the meeting, both the
    settlement and its terms were kept secret.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Arnold was not advised of the fact of a
    settlement until late in the day on October 13 and only contemporaneously with the
    acceptance of the Teskey offer to settle.  Clearly, the Teskey Group did not want GMA to learn about the fact of
    the settlement any earlier, presumably so that it could complete the
    negotiations and execution of the offer of settlement before Mr. Arnold had the
    opportunity to take any recourse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, when the fact of the settlement was
    disclosed to Mr. Arnold, both Groups refused to disclose its terms.  Indeed, the settlement specifically provided that
    its terms  would remain
    confidential.  Only by obtaining an order
    for production was GMA finally able to ascertain the terms of settlement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Groups’ determination to keep the settlement
    secret is also evident from the haste with which it was completed.  On Sunday, the parties first met.  On Monday, they spoke again.  On Tuesday, Mr. Teskey presented the Gura
    Group with a draft offer to settle, which required acceptance by 6:00 p.m. on
    Wednesday.  The settlement was accomplished
    with remarkable expedition, particularly compared to the lengthy history of the
    litigation.  While Mr. Teskey tried to explain
    this by saying that he intended to be away the following week, such a brief
    planned absence does not serve to explain the haste with which the Groups acted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I conclude that the behaviour of the Teskey and
    Gura Groups supported the trial judge’s finding that the purpose of the
    settlement was to defeat GMA’s accounts.</p>
  <h2><i>(3)</i> <i>Commercial reasonableness</i>  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants also take exception to the trial
    judge’s finding that the accepted offer was not commercially reasonable, at
    least, from the Gura Group’s perspective.  On this issue, the appellants put forward two arguments.  First, they argue that because the trial
    judge informed them that he would not be considering the merits of the Kymbo
    action, it was unfair for him to determine the commercial reasonableness of the
    settlement.  Second, the appellants argue
    that the evidence did not support the trial judge’s finding about the
    commercial reasonableness of the settlement, which was largely based on his
    finding of a secret payment and his conclusion that the Gura Group could have
    walked away from the action.  I do not
    accept these arguments. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the first point, the appellants brought a
    motion before the trial judge after the delivery of his reasons seeking to
    reopen the trial on the issue of the merits of the Kymbo action.  In refusing to reopen the trial, the trial
    judge comprehensively explained the distinction between dealing with the Kymbo
    action on its merits, which he did not do in his original reasons, and
    considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the settlement, including
    the parties’ conduct, which he did take into account.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not mislead counsel in any
    way.  As he said, he made no
    determination about the merits of the Kymbo action.  The trial judge simply considered the
    behaviour of the parties because that behaviour explained why the settlement
    was conducted in secret, rendering it more likely that the Teskey Group paid
    the Gura Group money in order to achieve a settlement.  I do not accept the submission that the
    appellants were denied trial fairness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the second point of commercial
    reasonableness, an issue referred to by both counsel in opening arguments at
    trial, the trial judge considered whether it was likely that the Gura Group
    would have settled the action without any payment from the Teskey Group.  He determined that it was not.  That determination is supported by the
    evidence.  I say this for several
    reasons.  First, the Gura Group had been
    reluctant to even deliver the $500,000 offer on October 5.  Thus, it was extremely unlikely that it would
    agree, a mere five days later, to a settlement under which it received no
    compensation.  Second, based on the
    opinion of Mr. Burkes, Mr. Gura Sr. was of the view that the Teskey Group owed
    the Gura Group more than $1.2 million.  With that opinion in hand, Mr. Gura Sr. was unlikely to settle for nothing.  Third, it made no sense for the Gura Group to
    give all the membership documents and all the promissory notes to the Teskey
    Group for free.  Fourth, the Teskey Group
    was required to hold $400,000 in trust, which the Gura Group perceived put it
    in a favourable position.  Fifth, absent
    some financial advantage under the settlement, logic says it was in the Gura
    Group’s interest to await the determination of the reserved injunction motion
    and the quantification of security for costs before entering into a
    settlement.  Sixth, the direct settlement
    was made when the Gura Group knew it owed GMA more than $100,000 and at a time
    when it continued to have confidence in GMA.  Accordingly, there was no reason for the timing and the manner of the
    settlement, except to defeat GMA’s fees.  Finally, but importantly, while the offer to settle specifically provided
    that the Gura Group would not pay anything to the Teskey Group, there was the
    glaring omission of any reciprocal provision that the Teskey Group would not
    pay anything to the Gura Group.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result of these factors, there was overwhelming
    direct and circumstantial evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that
    the Teskey Group agreed to make a secret payment to the Gura Group.  That finding, in turn, renders the trial judge’s
    conclusion of collusion unassailable.  It
    simply makes no sense for the Teskey Group to conceal its payment to the Gura
    Group unless it did so for the purpose of defeating GMA’s claim.  I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <h2>Costs </h2>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
