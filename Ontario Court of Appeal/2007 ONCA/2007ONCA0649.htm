style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The main issue on this appeal concerns whether a
    licensing by-law passed by the City of Toronto (the “City”) prohibiting
    commercial parking lots from issuing private parking tickets to vehicles parked
    without the parking lot owner’s consent applies to Imperial Parking Canada
    Corporation’s (“Impark”) activities in operating various commercial parking
    lots.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Impark is the operator or manager of various
    commercial parking lots in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.
    Some of these lots are unattended. Signs at the unattended lots advise persons
    who may wish to park at the lots that Impark offers space for public parking on
    the terms and conditions set out on the signs. The signs say that if a person
    parks without displaying a valid ticket or pass the rate is $69.55 per day (a
    rate well in excess of the usual parking rate) and that, in addition, the
    person’s car may be subject to being tagged or towed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On July 22, 2004, the City enacted By-Law
    725-2004 (the “2004 Amending By-Law”). Amongst other things, the 2004 Amending By-Law
    amended the City’s licensing regulations in relation to businesses that operate
    commercial parking lots or perform parking enforcement services on private
    property by prohibiting the issuance of any form of demand for payment relating
    to unauthorized parking other than a parking infraction notice under Part II of
    the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City takes the position that the 2004
    Amending By-Law applies to the actions of Impark in attempting to enforce
    payment of what the City views as a fine or penalty if a person fails to
    display a valid parking ticket. Impark disputes the City’s position, saying
    that it consents to people parking on its lots without proper advance payment
    and that the 2004 Amending By-Law does not therefore apply to its actions.
    Impark also maintains that the 2004 Amending By-Law is <i>ultra vires</i> the
    City’s licensing powers under s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c.25<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and that
    it should be quashed under s. 273 of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, for
    illegality. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On May 23, 2006, on the application of Impark,
    Stewart J. issued a declaration that the 2004 Amending By-Law does not apply to
    Impark’s activities as an operator of commercial parking lots in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto. In particular,
    she found that the signs posted on Impark’s lots expressly state that Impark
    consents to the parking of cars without payment in advance and held that the
    fees that Impark collects are sums owing to it in contract rather than damages
    for trespass. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently, on January 5, 2007, the
    application judge ordered that the City pay to Impark the sum of $90,000.00 on
    account of costs on a partial indemnity scale inclusive of disbursements and
    G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City raises three issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>did the application judge err by failing to
    appreciate that the true legal character of Impark’s conduct involves imposing
    fines or penalties for unauthorized parking and that the 2004 Amending By-Law
    applies to such conduct;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>did the application judge commit a palpable and
    overriding error in finding that Impark consents to parking without proper
    payment in advance by relying on Impark’s characterization of its activities
    without considering the whole of the evidence; and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>did the application judge err by issuing a
    declaration in circumstances where the determination of rights turns on
    individual fact situations?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the City applies to introduce fresh
    evidence on appeal to demonstrate that, subsequent to the date of the
    application judge’s decision, Impark applied for a licence to perform parking
    enforcement services on its commercial parking lots. The City claims that this
    evidence directly contradicts the conclusion that Impark does not perform
    parking enforcement services at its commercial parking lots.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the City seeks leave to appeal the
    costs award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal and the City’s application to introduce fresh evidence. While I would
    grant leave to appeal the costs award, I would dismiss the appeal relating to
    costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Impark’s application in the court below was
    heard together with an application made by Municipal Parking Corporation (“Municipal”)
    requesting that the 2004 Amending By-Law be quashed. The application judge
    dealt with Municipal’s request in separate reasons and, in her reasons relating
    to Impark’s application, did not address Impark’s alternative grounds
    concerning the validity of the 2004 Amending By-Law. This appeal was heard at
    the same time as the appeal in <i>Municipal Parking</i> <i>Corporation v. City
    of Toronto</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2080.
    Separate reasons relating to that appeal will be released concurrently with
    these reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><b>i) Impark’s Business
    Activities</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As already noted, Impark is the operator or
    manager of various commercial parking lots in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto. In the material filed in support of
    Impark’s application, a representative of Impark provided a description of
    Impark’s business. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In essence, Impark contends that, through its
    signage, it enters into a contract with its customers for parking services
    “whereby the customer chooses either to pay less by paying for the services
    fully in advance, or to pay more in arrears with the possibility of Impark
    towing the vehicle”. Impark’s representative claimed that the Federal Court of
    Appeal has made a ruling to that effect with the result that Impark is required
    to pay G.S.T. on all monies collected for parking services, including monies
    collected where the customer does not pay in advance. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Impark’s representative also deposed that Impark
    has modified its signs since the Federal Court of Appeal decision, “to clarify
    the contractual and consensual nature of the terms of the Parking Contract.” He
    also said, “Impark consents to vehicle parking without displaying a valid pass
    or sufficient vouchers, on the terms set out in the signage displayed at each
    unattended Impark lot.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her reasons for decision, the application
    judge summarized Impark’s description of its operation and business practices
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>(a)
    Many of the Impark lots in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    have no attendant on site. The parking service provided at unattended Impark
    lots offers persons who park there a choice of either paying in advance by purchasing
    and displaying parking vouchers obtained from a dispenser, or by paying a much
    higher amount to be recovered through a payment collection process if they park
    without a voucher or for a longer time than that for which their voucher
    applies. These options are displayed prominently on signs at each unattended
    Impark lot; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>(b)
    The signs at unattended Impark lots in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Imperial
    Parking Canada Corporation (“Impark”) accepts no responsibility for loss, theft
    or damage to vehicle or contents. We do not take custody of vehicle but rent
    space only. Vehicles that do not display a valid ticket or pass may be tagged
    and/or towed away and held for storage charges, if applicable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY…THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=right style='
text-align:right;
line-height:normal;'>GST #887315638RT0002</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>Impark is by this sign offering space for
    public parking. You accept this offer by parking on this lot. Do not park on
    this lot if you do not agree to these terms and conditions. All requirements of
    notice and acceptance are hereby waived by Imperial Parking Canada Corporation.
    If you park and do not display a valid ticket or pass the rate is $69.55 per
    day or portion thereof. In addition your car may be subject to being tagged
    and/or towed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>By parking on this lot, you grant permission
    to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to provide registered owner
    information, including name and address, for the vehicle you are driving, to
    Impark, it agents, for the purpose of collecting unpaid parking fees and
    violation notice fees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(c) Impark employs personnel to patrol its
    unattended lots. In the event a vehicle is parked without displaying a valid or
    sufficient voucher, a notice is placed on the vehicle (a “Payment Notice”). The
    Payment Notice informs the person who parked the car that a contract debt is
    owed to Impark for the parking service; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(d) Impark claims that its form of Payment
    Notice has been designed to be distinct from the form of Parking Infraction
    Notice issued by the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    under Part II of the <i>Provincial Offences
    Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(e) Each time a Payment Notice is issued, two
    digital photographs are taken: one of the dashboard of the car to show that no
    valid pass or parking vouchers are on display, and another of the car on the
    lot to show its licence plate;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(f) When a Payment Notice is issued, a
    database of unpaid Payment Notices is consulted by hand-held access. Impark may
    request the vehicle to be towed if there are unpaid Payment Notices for the
    vehicle. Impark states that it generally tows only vehicles parked in a stall
    designated for disabled customers without an appropriate permit, in a fire
    route, in front of a fire hydrant, blocking a driveway, blocking a door of a
    building, or those which have been parked for lengthy periods of time;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(g) The Payment notice provides instructions
    for payment and how to contact Impark, by telephone or by mail, to dispute the
    debt. Customers have the option of disputing the Payment Notice in writing;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(h) Depending on the nature of the dispute,
    Impark’s customer service representatives can insist on payment of the full
    amount, reduce the amount owing, or cancel the notice and issue a refund where
    appropriate;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(i) If the parking debt remains unresolved
    for six weeks, the vehicle owner information is searched through the Ontario
    Ministry of Transportation with which Impark has an agreement. The name and
    address of the vehicle owner is obtained, and a statement mailed; and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>(j) If the parking debt cannot be resolved by
    negotiation, or where there has been no payment or other contact in respect of
    the vehicle, Impark’s usual course of action is to assign the parking debt to a
    collection agency. Some clients whom Impark manages parking lots have dictated
    to Impark that Payment Notices for their locations are not to be forwarded for
    collection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span

    described based on Impark’s evidence, the City characterizes the notices that
    Impark describes as Payment Notices as private parking tickets that impose a

    violation (“parking violators”). The City relies on the fact that the notices
    refer to improper parking and a “violation”, as well as the fact that the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After describing the 2004 Amending By-Law in
    general terms and setting out Impark’s description of its business practices,
    the application judge turned to her analysis. She began by noting that “Parking
    Enforcement Services” is specifically defined under the 2004 Amending By-Law as
    being limited to activities carried on “in relation to vehicles parked on
    private property without the consent of the owner or occupant of the property.”
    She described Impark’s position as being “[i]n a nutshell, … that the vehicles
    with which it deals are parked on property with the consent of the owner or
    occupant of such property and therefore the By-Law amendment does not apply to
    it.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application judge went on to describe the
    modern approach to the interpretation of municipal powers. She concluded, “[w]hen
    read as a whole and construed fairly and liberally, the By-Law Amendment is …
    designed to deal with what
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    views as unscrupulous or overzealous private policing of private property on

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerning the City’s position, she said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            On
    this Application,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    attempts to portray the scenario in which a customer of Impark parks without
    purchasing a voucher or overstays the limit provided for by a purchased voucher
    as being akin to a trespass. Accordingly,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    argues that once a customer has “overstayed his welcome”, a trespass has
    occurred and therefore the parking is done without the consent of the owner or
    occupant of the lot. In such circumstances, the By-Law Amendment is said by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto to extend to
    Impark’s business operations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Returning to Impark’s position the application
    judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            As
    already noted, Impark’s position is that persons who park vehicles on its lots
    do so with the consent of the property owner. The rates imposed by it for so doing
    are more properly characterized as being among the terms of the parking
    contract which results. I agree with Impark’s approach to this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After reviewing <i>Imperial Parking v. Canada</i>,
    [2000] F.C.J. No. 1011 (C.A.), in which the court concluded that Impark is
    required to pay G.S.T. on its revenues because its dealings with its customers
    are contractual in nature, the application judge observed that “there may be
    circumstances in which it could be argued successfully that no contract for
    parking has been formed—perhaps in an individual case in which the doctrine of <i>non
    est factum </i>or mistake may apply”. However, she nevertheless considered “the
    proper characterization of Impark’s relationship with those who use its parking
    lots as being contractual in nature.” She said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            As
    a result, the fees which Impark collects are sums owing to it under contract
    and not damages for trespass. Trespass has little relevance to this situation,
    where the signs used by Impark state explicitly that Impark consents to the use
    of its parking spaces without payment in advance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            Accordingly,
    it must be concluded that the steps being taken by or on behalf of Impark to
    collect payment of its rates are not “Parking Enforcement Services” as
    currently defined in the By-Law Amendment. Under this construction of the
    By-Law Amendment, its provisions do not apply to the activities of Impark to
    collect unpaid parking fees or to tow vehicles in accordance with conditions
    posted on signs at the parking lot it operates.</p>

    erred by approaching the issue to be determined by her as involving a choice
    between whether Impark operates under the law of contract or the law of
    trespass. The City says that, in so doing, the application judge failed to
    apply contractual principles indicating that the true legal character of
    Impark’s conduct involves imposing fines or penalties on the owners of vehicles
    where the driver of the vehicle fails to pay the proper parking fee in advance.
    The City relies on the fact that fines or penalties cannot be imposed as a
    matter of contract law. It contends that the true legal character of Impark’s
    conduct is an attempt to extract fines or penalties from parking violators and
    that the 2004 Amending By-Law prohibits such conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not accept these submissions. The City did
    not challenge the application judge’s finding that, properly construed, the
    2004 Amending By-Law is “designed to deal with what
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto views as unscrupulous or overzealous
    private policing of private property on which vehicles have parked <i>without

    interpretation of the 2004 Amending By-Law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Read literally, s. 545-269J of the 2004 Amending
    By-Law contains what appears to be a blanket prohibition on commercial parking
    lot owners issuing any “document, tag, ticket or notice, or request or demand
    for payment in relation to vehicles parked on the licensed premises other than
    a parking infraction notice under Part II of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>,
    a Toronto Police Services tow card or other document as approved by the Chief
    of Police” and the prohibition appears unrelated to whether vehicles are parked
    with the parking lot owner’s consent. However, PINs and tow cards can be issued
    only where vehicles are parked without the parking lots owner’s consent (see s.
    915 of the Toronto Municipal Code). It therefore makes sense that the
    prohibition in s. 545-269J was only intended to apply in relation to vehicles
    parked without the parking lot owner’s consent. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The final recital in the preamble of the 2004
    Amending By-Law supports this interpretation. It says that the City’s intention
    in enacting the amendment was “to restrict persons undertaking parking
    enforcement activities or providing parking enforcement services … to the
    issuance of parking infraction notices under Part II of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, a Toronto Police Services tow card and other documents, as
    approved by the Chief of Police”. The definition of Parking Enforcement
    Services in the 2004 Amending By-Law refers to “any parking enforcement
    activity …  carried on in relation to
    vehicles parked on private property without the consent of the owner or
    occupant of such property.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accepting that the proper interpretation of s.
    545-269J is that it applies only in relation to vehicles parked without the
    parking lot owner’s consent, the core issue the application judge was required
    to determine was whether Impark consents to vehicles parking on its unattended
    parking lots when proper advance payment is not made. Assuming, without
    deciding, that the City is correct and that the payments Impark seeks to
    recover in these circumstances would, as a matter of contract law, be construed
    as penalties, that is not determinative of the issue of whether Impark consents
    to the parking nor of the issue of whether Impark has entered into a contract
    with the driver of the vehicle. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the contrary, in my view, the issue of
    whether the payments Impark seeks to collect are penalties is a matter that
    arises only once it has been determined that a contract exists between Impark
    and a person who parked without making a proper advance payment. At that point,
    a finding that the payment was a penalty would go only to the enforceability of
    the contract.    </p>

    following sentence in its signs as constituting consent to parking without
    advance payment, “[i]f you park and do not display a valid ticket or pass the
    rate is $69.55 per day or portion thereof”, that suggestion is contradicted by
    the next sentence in the signs, which says: “[i]n addition, your car may be
    subject to being tagged or towed”;</p>

style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Impark’s so-called Payment Notices and
    statements refer to improper parking as well as a “violation”; the claims for
    payment in the Payment Notices are well in excess of the usual parking rate and
    escalate over time; and Impark purports to rely on both the law of contract and
    the law of trespass in both its Payment Notices and Statements; and</p>

style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in its agreement with the Minister of

    parked’ vehicles.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> I do not
    accept these submissions. While it may have been preferable had the application
    judge explained in more detail why she accepted Impark’s position that persons
    who park on its lots do so with its consent, in my view, the primary evidence
    to be considered in relation to this issue was the evidence of the contents of
    Impark’s signs. The application judge set out the terms of the signs in full
    and made a finding that the signs “state explicitly that Impark consents to the
    use of its parking spaces without payment in advance.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the signs do not contain an express
    statement to that effect, they do say:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Impark is by this sign offering space for public
    parking. You accept this offer by parking on this lot. Do not park on this lot
    if you do not agree to these terms and conditions … If you park and do not
    display a valid ticket or pass the rate is $69.55 per day or portion thereof.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the offer of space for public parking
    together with the statement that the rate for parking is $69.55 per day if the
    parker fails to display a valid ticket, are crucial provisions demonstrating
    Impark’s consent to parking even where proper advance payment is not made.
    Although the signs also say that vehicles that do not display a valid ticket
    may be tagged, in the context of a business offering public parking, I see no
    error in the application judge’s conclusion that that term, (along with the
    inflated parking rate) is merely one of the conditions Impark seeks to impose
    in exchange for its consent to parking. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not accept the City’s submission that the
    reference in the signs to the possibility of vehicles being “tagged” is a clear
    reference to a City parking infraction notice. Given the statement that the
    rate is $69.55 per day when a valid ticket is not displayed, I interpret being
    “tagged” as meaning leaving a notice charging the applicable fee. However, even
    if being “tagged” does refer to a City parking infraction notice, at most, I consider
    reference to the possibility of “being tagged and/or towed” as meaning consent
    to parking <i>may</i> be withdrawn at some point in the future. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this regard, to the extent that the
    application judge concluded tagging, by means of issuing a PIN and towing, to
    be part of the contractual terms Impark seeks to impose, I disagree. In my
    view, both concepts are inconsistent with the notion of consensual parking. In
    accordance with the City’s parking by-law, PINs can only be issued where
    parking is without consent. Moreover, since towing terminates parking, I fail
    to see how it can be part of a contract for consensual parking. Properly
    construed, in my view, Impark’s signs offer consensual parking even where
    proper advance payment is not made with the possibility that consent will, at
    some point, be withdrawn. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, I consider that it is an open question
    whether Impark would be entitled to enforce any of the terms it purports to
    impose by means of its signs in the context of a particular case. Apart from
    issues concerning whether there is, in fact, a binding contract to pay the
    posted rate in a given case and, if there is, whether the posted rate
    constitutes a penalty, there may also be questions concerning when and how
    Impark would be entitled to withdraw its consent to parking. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leaving aside situations involving abandonment,
    I fail to see how Impark could withdraw its consent to parking without
    providing the vehicle driver with express notice of that fact. Moreover, if and
    when Impark purported to withdraw its consent, it would be required to comply
    with the City’s parking by-law and cause a PIN to be issued before having a
    vehicle towed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly, there may be an issue concerning
    whether Impark is properly entitled to vehicle information under its agreement
    with the Minister of Transportation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my opinion, however, none of these potential
    issues undermine the essential message contained in Impark’s signs posted on
    its parking lots, namely that it offers public parking and that it consents to
    such parking even where proper payment is not made in advance. Members of the
    public are entitled to rely on that message. Moreover, Impark’s consent is a
    factor that may affect its entitlement to enforce some of the terms it purports
    to impose. In my view, the fact that Impark uses ambiguous or confusing
    language in its Payment Notices (e.g. references to a “violation”) and other
    documentation does not detract from this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='

    the application judge err by issuing a declaration in circumstances where the
    determination of rights turns on individual fact situations?</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In essence, the City argues that a declaration
    was not a proper remedy in all of the circumstances of this case for two
    reasons. First, because the question of whether there is an enforceable contract
    in any given case is a case-specific, fact-driven issue that cannot be
    addressed in advance by means of a declaration. Second, because Impark should
    not be allowed to pick and choose when the By-Law does or does not apply by
    requesting that PINs be issued and vehicles be towed in some circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reject these submissions. As already
    indicated, in my view, it is an open question whether Impark would be entitled
    to enforce the terms it seeks to impose by means of its signs in the context of
    any particular case. However, as I have explained, that does not alter the
    conclusion that, leaving aside certain specific situations (e.g. parking in
    fire routes, disabled parking spaces etc.), Impark consents to parking on its
    lots and does so even where proper payment is not made in advance. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since the 2004 Amending By-Law applies only
    where vehicles have parked without the parking lot owner’s consent, in my view,
    it was entirely appropriate to make an order declaring that the 2004 Amending By-Law
    does not apply to steps taken by Impark to collect its rates. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To the extent that Impark requests that PINs be
    issued and that vehicles be towed in some circumstances based either on posted
    signs indicating certain forms of parking are unauthorized (e.g. parking in
    fire routes, disabled parking spaces etc.) or on a purported withdrawal of
    consent to continued parking, in my view, the 2004 Amending By-Law does apply
    to these circumstances because the particular form of parking is non-consensual.
    However, in my view, this does not mean that a declaration was an inappropriate
    remedy; rather, it simply means that the application judge’s reasoning does not
    apply to these circumstances, nor in turn does her declaration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would not give
    effect to any of the City’s grounds of appeal. If necessary, I would order that
    the declaration be clarified in accordance with paragraph 57 of these reasons.
    For the sake of clarity, I would add that these reasons are intended to address
    the proper interpretation of the 2004 Amending By-Law and should not be read as
    interpreting the City’s authority under s. 150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, to regulate Impark’s business. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted, the City applies to introduce fresh
    evidence on appeal to demonstrate that, subsequent to the date of the
    application judge’s decision, Impark applied for a licence to perform parking
    enforcement services on its commercial parking lots as a PPEA. The City points
    to the application judge’s conclusion that “the steps being taken by or on
    behalf of Impark to collect payment of its rates are not ‘Parking Enforcement Services’
    as currently defined in [the 2004 Amending By-Law]” and claims that the
    proposed fresh evidence directly contradicts this finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reject this submission. The material filed by
    Impark on its application indicated that when a vehicle is improperly parked in
    a parking stall designated for vehicles displaying a valid disabled placard,
    Impark does not issue a Payment Notice but rather requests an MLEO to issue a
    PIN and have the vehicle towed. The proposed fresh evidence does not disclose
    the reason why Impark applied for a licence to perform parking enforcement
    services. Given the evidence filed on the application that Impark uses the
    services of MLEOs in relation to disabled parking spaces, I see no basis for
    concluding that the proposed fresh evidence would contradict the application
    judge’s conclusion that Impark does not perform parking enforcement services in
    collecting payment of its rates. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I am not persuaded that the proposed fresh

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The City appears to argue that leave to appeal
    costs has already been granted by virtue of a consent order dated January 27,
    2007 granting it leave to amend its notice of appeal and file a supplementary
    appeal book and factum addressing costs. I do not interpret the January 27,
    2007 order that way.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In relation to costs, the City makes three
    submissions. First, the City claims that, having rejected Impark’s claims for
    substantial indemnity costs based on a finding that the City had serious and
    legitimate concerns about Impark’s business practices, it was not open to the
    application judge to conclude that such issues “were not of such major public significance
    that [Impark] should be deprived of recovery of costs”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the City submits that the application
    judge erred in failing to recognize that by holding that the City had serious
    and legitimate concerns about Impark’s business practices, she had implicitly
    rejected at least some of the alternative grounds relied on by Impark in
    support of its application and therefore erred in failing to reduce the Impark’s
    costs recovery accordingly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the City submits that the quantum of
    costs awarded does not reflect a fair and reasonable amount having regard to
    the nature of the case, the success achieved, the conduct of Impark and the
    reasonable expectations of the City. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, none of these submissions support a
    finding that the application judge erred in principle in her award of costs. In
    particular, I see no error in the application judge’s conclusion that, rather
    than raising novel issues of significant public importance, this case was
    ultimately decided on “fairly basic principles.” Further, even if the
    application judge implicitly rejected some aspects of Impark’s alternative
    grounds in her costs reasons, in my view, she did so to a very limited extent.
    Moreover, her findings that Impark was successful in a complex matter of
    obvious great importance to both parties remain intact. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the application judge’s reasons
    relating to costs demonstrate that she fairly considered the nature and
    complexity of the proceedings, the conduct of the parties, the relative success
    achieved and reasonable expectations of the losing party. Accordingly, I see no
    basis for interfering with the exercise of her discretion. While I would grant
    leave to appeal the award of costs, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    the foregoing reasons, subject to clarifying the declaration if necessary in
    accordance with paragraph 57, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to Impark
    on a partial indemnity scale fixed at $20,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and

    property; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>WHEREAS Council has therefore decided, in the

    Municipal Code. However, there was no issue on this appeal concerning the
    City’s position that Impark is a commercial parking lot and that it falls
    within the definition of “Public Garage”, which is a defined term in s. 545-1.
    Under s. 545-2(31) every person who owns or operates a public garage is
    required to be licensed.</p>
