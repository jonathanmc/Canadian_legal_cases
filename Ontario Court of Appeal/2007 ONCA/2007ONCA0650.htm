    while sparring with a fellow classmate following formal judo class sessions at
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Windsor Judo Club.  As a result of the injuries he sustained, he
    became a quadriplegic.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claims of Mr. Lam and his family members
    were ultimately settled and paid by the appellant, as the University’s
    insurer.  In this action the appellant seeks
    contribution to that settlement from the insurer for the Ontario Judo Black
    Belt Association (known as “Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario”).  It argues that Judo Ontario’s policy provided
    overlapping coverage to Mr. Lam’s judo instructors, and that the trial judge
    erred in concluding otherwise.</p>

    – in the words of the witnesses – for the academic year 1994/1995. However, it
    did not take steps to “re-register” for the academic year 1995/1996, as its
    numbers did not warrant doing so. While the Club did re-register as a member of
    Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    for the academic year 1996/1997, it did not do so until after the accident

    at the time Mr. Lam sustained his injuries.  However, he was ill in September 1996 and asked Jason Temple, a brown
    belt member of the Club, to take the class for him on the evening in
    question.  Mr. Hamel was present at the
    beginning of the evening to greet the judo participants and to sign up new
    members for the Club and Judo

    informally.  Mr. Lam was injured.  He and Mr. Piesec were not being supervised

    Temple (as the two instructors responsible

    claims were settled for a total sum of $2.75 million. By agreement among the defendants
    to the Lam action, Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance Exchange (“CURIE”)
    funded the settlement, but each defendant’s liability and each insurer’s
    responsibility for any such liability were to be determined subsequently.</p>

    the trial with respect to each defendant’s liability.  She found the University, Ron Hamel and Jason
    Temple to be equally responsible for the plaintiffs’ damages.  Mr. Hamel was liable for failing to tell Mr.
    Temple not to leave the class members unsupervised to practice on their
    own.  Mr. Temple was liable for
    permitting the students to practice after the class had ended.  The University, as occupier of the premises
    where the accident occurred, was liable for failing to insist that the
    activities of the class be properly supervised.  Justice MacFarland found no liability on the part of either Mr. Piesec
    or Judo

    dispute arose as to each insurer’s responsibility. In particular, three
    insurers provided overlapping coverage as follows: the appellant, CURIE,
    provides coverage to the University and to the two judo instructors in that
    context (the “CURIE Policy”); the respondent, CGU, provides coverage to Judo
    Ontario and its Member Clubs under a policy originally underwritten by GAN
    Canada Insurance Company (the “GAN Policy”);<a

    State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, provides separate coverage to Mr. Temple.  CGU acknowledges that the GAN policy, for
    which it is responsible, constitutes primary coverage and the CURIE Policy
    excess coverage.  CGU disputes, however,
    that Messrs. Hamel and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Temple
    were insured under the GAN Policy at the time of the accident.  This issue (which had not been before
    MacFarland J.) was determined by Justice W. Siegel in the proceedings that are
    the subject matter of this appeal.<a href="#_ftn3"

    coverage, CGU is obliged to contribute its limit of $1 million to the
    settlement.</p>

    respect to the organization of the Club, Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s
    membership practices, and the Club’s “registration” with Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>30        First,
    the By-laws contemplate registration of judo clubs as well as individuals. A
    judo club could apply for registration with Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    provided it was sponsored by a black belt registered with Judo
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. The application
    process consisted of completion of a registration form of Judo
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and submission
    of the requisite fee. It was understood that Judo Ontario expected the black
    belt sponsor of a judo club to be its head administrator.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>31        Second,
    the only significance of a judo club failing to register with Judo Ontario in
    any year is that the individual members of the club are unable to attend
    competitions and other events and programmes held by Judo Ontario or its parent
    national body in that year, subject to being allowed to participate as a <i>de facto</i> member of another registered
    club.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>32        Third,
    both
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Temple and Hamel were individual members in
    good standing of Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    at the time of the Accident. Neither was paid for any services they rendered to
    the Club or to any other judo club registered with Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario with which they had an association.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>33        Fourth,
    the Club had existed since 1958 and was not an incorporated entity. The
    University gave the Club access to its facilities to conduct the Club's
    activities. Hamel, who was a black belt, ran the Club more recently and acted
    as the head administrator for the Club. While it is possible that the Club had
    been registered with Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    prior to the 1994/1995 academic year, there is no evidence to indicate any such
    registration. Hamel sponsored the Club in its application for membership in
    Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in the 1994/1995 academic year and,
    accordingly, the Club was a registered member of Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario in the 1994/1995 academic year.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>34        Fifth,
    while the Club was not registered with Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario during the 1995/1996 academic year,
    it continued to conduct its own training activities during that year. There are
    no legal or other requirements that prevented the Club from carrying on in this
    manner. It had only a small number of members during that academic year but,
    based on Hamel's evidence, I find that at least some of those members were registered
    individually with Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    during that year.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>35        Sixth,
    university judo clubs were typically organized in September. In the case of the
    Club, while prospective members of the Club signed a waiver at their first
    session, they were permitted to attend a few sessions before being required to
    sign a registration form to become a member of Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    and to pay the requisite fees to the University and Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. Hamel would obtain these fees and
    registration forms from all continuing members of the Club at one time at the
    end of September in each year. If there were enough members likely to
    participate in competitions conducted by Judo Ontario, Hamel would collect a
    further amount to pay the Judo Ontario Club membership fee and would register
    the Club with Judo Ontario, as he did in the 1994/1995 academic year and in the
    1996/1997 academic year after the date of the Accident.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>36        Lastly,
    Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario proceeded on the basis that a
    Club ceased to be a member of Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    at the end of a registration period if it failed to renew its registration by
    completing a new registration form and paying the requisite fee. This approach
    was also reflected in the view of representatives of Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario that the provisions of section 2.03
    of the By-Laws were not applicable to judo clubs and, accordingly, only
    individual members could fall into the category of a member who was not in good
    standing. It was therefore not the practice of Judo Ontario to give notice to a
    member club of its default, or to take any other action, if the member club
    failed to pay its fees for a new registration period, although there may have
    been a practice of sending a renewal notice/invoice to each registered club at
    the end of its registration period or shortly into the following period similar
    to the notice/invoice sent annually to individuals. Judo
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario simply treated such clubs as ceasing
    to be members after a period of time.</p>

    Ontario are those admitted to membership by
    the Judo Ontario board of directors (section 2.01).  I have noted earlier that the By-law makes no
    reference to “registration,” a term used by the various witnesses and picked up
    by the trial judge.  Although to lay
    people the term “registration” may well express the practical effect of filling
    out “registration” forms and sending in membership fees as a condition of being
    admitted to membership, members are “admitted” under the By-law; they are not
    “registered”.  In my view, this
    distinction between “admission” and the annual practice of “registration” has
    led to confusion about the circumstances in which a member may cease to be a
    member of Judo

    remain members unless they resign (section 2.02), or are suspended or expelled

    of Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    it was still a member. The failure of the Club to pay fees provided Judo
    Ontario with the grounds to suspend or expel the Club (section 2.03(a));
    however, notice of neither its default nor its opportunity to cure the default
    within 30 days was given to the Club, and no suspension or expulsion resolution
    was passed by the board (section 2.03).  As a result, the Club remained a member of Judo

    representatives and Mr. Hamel – that the requirements of section 2.03 did not
    apply to member clubs.  He cited two
    additional factors to buttress his conclusion, namely that section 2.03 did not
    unambiguously indicate that it included member clubs as well as individuals,
    and that there are other provisions in Section II that appear to be limited in
    operation to individual members (sections 2.06 and 2.07).  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the latter point, I do not see
    how the fact that section 2.06 limits those who may be elected directors or
    officers, or those who are entitled to vote at meetings, to members in good
    standing who are holders of a black belt degree is relevant to whether section
    2.03 applies to club members as well as individual members.  It is obvious that only individuals can be
    officers or directors or hold a black belt, and there may be no good reason for
    “clubs” to have a vote.  Secondly, I do
    not agree that the provisions of section 2.07(a), which requires that a member be
    a Canadian citizen and/or a resident of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    can only apply to individuals; a club may have a residence in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario for purposes of membership.  Nor do I agree with the trial judge’s
    conclusion that section 2.09 (which requires that participants in association
    events be members in good standing) further buttresses his interpretation
    because it is intended to have reference only to individual members; I read
    section 2.09 as applying to all members, including member clubs. Finally, while
    section 2.06 (Officers and Directors) may be confined to individual members, s.
    2.08 specifically deals with club memberships alone. This reinforces the
    interpretation that, read as a part of Section II as a whole, section 2.03 is
    intended to apply to both club and individual members.</p>

    findings recited in para. 19 above.  I do
    not view it as being dispositive of the issue of membership in Judo
    <st1:place

    reflection of the perspective of lay people concerning the practical operations

    bearing in mind the significance of the concept of “member in good standing”.</p>

    the basis that the By-law resulted in automatic termination of clubs without

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    what really happened in terms of the governing By-law was that those clubs
    ceased to be “members in good standing” for that period.  The practical effect was the same.  A club that was not a member in good standing
    could not participate in Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no reason why the language of section 2.03
    should not be given its plain and ordinary meaning: to be suspended or expelled
    from membership, a member – including a member club – must be given notice and
    an opportunity to cure the default and be subject to suspension or expulsion by
    resolution of the Judo Ontario board.  That did not happen with respect to the Club.  I am accordingly satisfied that at the time
    of the accident giving rise to Mr. Lam’s injury the Club remained a member of
    Judo Ontario.  It is therefore a named
    insured under the GAN Policy and coverage is provided to Mr. Hamel and Mr.

    were members of Judo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    at the time of the accident.  CGU
    acknowledged at trial that training classes are intended to be covered by the
    phrase “games, competitions or sports demonstrations” in Endorsement No. 2 of
    the Policy, and that training classes at Member Clubs are “authorized” by Judo
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario for purposes of
    the definition of a “sanctioned event” in the Policy.  The event was run by the Club.  While neither Mr. Hamel (who had left for the
    evening) nor Mr. Temple (who was left in charge) were directly participating in
    the post-session jousting, they were participating in a broad sense because Mr.
    Hamel was the person in charge, and on his departure, Mr. Temple became his
    delegate.  </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>Equitable Subrogation With Respect to Costs of the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial CURIE claimed that it was entitled to
    contribution from CGU respecting the costs of defending the Lam action and the
    costs of having Mr. Lam’s counsel participate in the proceedings before
    MacFarland J.  The parties agree on the
    quantum of this claim: $22,701.75.  It is
    based upon an insurer’s duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge rejected CURIE’s claim in this
    regard on the basis that it was dependent upon CURIE “establishing that
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Temple and Hamel were
    entitled to coverage under the GAN Policy.”  In that regard he was in error since an insurer’s obligation to defend
    is “wider than, and independent of, its obligation to indemnify”: <i>Broadhurst &amp; Ball and Allport v.
    American Home Insurance Co. et al.</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 225 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at
    231.  The test is not whether the insured
    is entitled to coverage but, rather, whether there might ultimately be coverage
    under the policy: <i>Nichols v. American
    Home Assurance Co.</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 11.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the purposes of this appeal, however, this
    distinction is not pertinent, as I have concluded that the GAN Policy must
    respond to the event.  Accordingly, CURIE
    is entitled to recover CGU’s <i>pro rata</i> share of the expenses relating to the Lam action.</p>
