  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>I. Overview </span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was convicted by Lipson J. of administering a stupefying substance
    for the purpose of committing an indictable offence and sexual assault. In
    addition to credit for fifty-six months pre-sentence custody, he was sentenced
    to twenty-two months imprisonment. He appeals from the convictions and seeks
    leave to appeal sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was jointly charged with P. T. R. with these offences (“the sexual
    assault charges”) and with certain other unrelated offences involving making,
    possessing and distributing child pornography. The sexual assault charges
    arose from a complaint by a long-time female friend of Mr. R. On May 21,
    2002, the complainant and the appellant (who had never met before) spent
    the evening socializing with Mr. R. During the course of the evening, the
    appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant. Traces of gammahyroxybutyrate
    (“GHB”), commonly known as the date rape drug, as well as DNA from the complainant
    and an unknown male, were later found in the complainant’s wine glass. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Prior
    to trial, Mr. R. brought an application under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></a> requesting that the charges against him be stayed because
    of unreasonable delay. The trial judge stayed the child pornography charges
    against Mr. R., but held that the delay in relation to the sexual assault
    charges was not unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    the first day of the joint trial, the Crown indicated that she would not
    be proceeding with the child pornography charges against the appellant. Counsel
    for the appellant then proposed to the trial judge that, in order to protect
    the appellant’s appeal rights, counsel would file a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    and invite the trial judge to make the same ruling he had made on Mr. R.’s
    application. The trial judge did not accept counsel’s proposal and the appellant
    did not file a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      After
    hearing the evidence, the trial judge concluded that the appellant added
    GHB to the complainant’s wine without her knowledge. In addition, he found
    that the complainant was in a drugged condition as she consumed her second
    and third glasses of wine (which was prior to any sexual contact) and that
    she was sufficiently sedated that she could not voluntarily agree to engage
    in sexual activity. The trial judge therefore convicted the appellant, but
    acquitted Mr. R. of both charges as he was not satisfied that Mr. R. knew
    the complainant was drugged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant raises five issues on his conviction appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    the trial judge err in failing to stay the sexual assault charges against
    him as a result of a violation of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    the trial judge misapprehend key evidence, namely: a) the toxicologist’s
    evidence concerning the concentrations of GHB in the complainant’s wine glass
    and concerning the effects of GHB in combination with alcohol; b) the complainant’s
    evidence whether she had previously experienced similar symptoms from alcohol
    consumption; and c) the appellant’s evidence suggesting that it was his DNA
    on the complainant’s wine glass;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    the trial judge err in finding that the complainant lacked the capacity to
    consent to sexual activity;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    the trial judge err in failing to find that the appellant had an honest but
    mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting to sexual activity;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    the appellant’s trial rendered unfair by the Crown’s cross-examination of
    the appellant and Mr. R.? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    addition, the appellant argues that the global sentence imposed on him was
    outside the appropriate range and therefore unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant did not make oral submissions concerning his fourth and fifth grounds
    of appeal against conviction. We did not call on the Crown to respond to
    those grounds, to the ground relating to alleged misapprehension of the appellant’s
    evidence, nor to the sentence appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Given
    the trial judge’s finding that the appellant added GHB to the appellant’s
    wine without her consent, in our view, there was no air of reality to the
    defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent and the trial judge made
    no error in failing to consider it. Further, we were not persuaded that the
    appellant identified any misconduct by the trial Crown capable of giving
    rise to a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we were not persuaded that the trial judge made any error in rejecting the
    appellant’s evidence that he used the complainant’s wine glass to mix GHB
    for his own use after he and the complainant began engaging in sexual activity.
    Moreover, the trial judge made an alternative finding that even if the appellant
    did use the complainant’s wine glass for that purpose, the complainant was
    drugged before any sexual activity began. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we rejected the appellant’s fourth and fifth grounds of appeal
    against conviction, as well as the ground relating to alleged misapprehension
    of the appellant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we viewed the sentence imposed as stiff, we were not persuaded that it was
    outside the range. The appellant had a prior record for sexual assault and
    the trial judge identified numerous aggravating factors to justify the sentence
    he imposed, not the least of which is that this was a planned crime involving
    the administration of a dangerous drug.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction appeal. While I would
    grant leave to appeal sentence, I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) The Parties</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    R. was sixty years old at the time of trial and openly bisexual. He owned
    and operated a small computer business and was also a self-employed photographer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was thirty-nine years old at time of trial. Prior to the incident,
    she and Mr. R. had been friends for years. Although their relationship was
    platonic, Mr. R. claimed at trial that the complainant made sexual advances
    to him in the months leading up to the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was twenty-six years old at the time of trial. He met Mr. R. in
    1997 while both were incarcerated. They remained friends following their
    release from custody and in the months leading up to May 21, 2002, Mr. R.
    was assisting the appellant in putting together a modelling portfolio. Although
    Mr. R. was attracted to the appellant, the appellant was heterosexual and
    did not reciprocate Mr. R.’s feelings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Events leading up
      to the May 21, 2002 incident</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 1, 2002, the complainant asked Mr. R. to photograph her in various
    sexual poses, including a number in which she was topless. At trial, Mr.
    R. acknowledged that prior to May 21, 2002 he e-mailed some of the topless
    photographs to three of his friends, including the appellant, without the
    complainant’s permission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early May 2002, the complainant left her laptop computer with Mr. R. for
    repairs. On May 20, 2002, Mr. R. contacted the complainant and suggested
    that she pick up her computer from his home on May 21, 2002 at around 9:00
    p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their testimony at trial, the appellant and Mr. R. claimed that they planned
    to meet at around 8:30 p.m. on May 21, 2002 for business purposes. The trial
    judge rejected this evidence. He found that prior to the complainant’s arrival,
    the appellant was high on GHB, Mr. R. had been consuming alcohol, and “the
    two men had been enjoying themselves surfing the internet for pornography.” Noting
    that Mr. R. had photographed the appellant in sexual situations with other
    women in the past, he found that Mr. R. wanted the complainant and the appellant
    to meet and “was clearly hoping that some kind of sexual encounter would
    occur involving [the complainant and the appellant] that would in turn satisfy
    his strong voyeuristic bent.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>iii) The May 21, 2002
      incident</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant arrived at Mr. R.’s house around 9:00 p.m. on May 21, 2002. Expecting
    the visit to be short, she parked on the street instead of in the driveway
    and left her purse and cell phone in the car. When Mr. R. greeted the complainant
    at the door, he said her laptop was in the basement. She accompanied him
    downstairs where she met the appellant. Mr. R. had purchased a bottle of
    red wine for her earlier in the day and he poured her a glass of it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    R. eventually took the complainant into a separate room containing his computer
    lab to show her her laptop. While in that room, Mr. R. asked the appellant
    to pour the complainant another drink. The appellant left the room and the
    complainant did not see him pour her second glass of wine. The group continued
    drinking and the complainant had three or possibly four glasses of wine in
    total.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge described the complainant’s memory of the ensuing events as “patchy.”  At
    some point she recalled looking at a website with pictures of the appellant
    in various modelling poses and acknowledged calling her daughter to tell
    her about the website. Although reluctant to do so, she agreed to have her
    picture taken with the appellant. The photographs show the appellant holding
    the complainant’s hand, kissing her cheek and either kissing or licking her
    fingers. The complainant also took two photographs. The trial judge found
    that the various photographs depict all three participants enjoying themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant recalled moving into the photo studio after the photo session.
    She said that at one point she was sitting cross-legged on the floor smoking
    a cigarette. Her next memory was of seeing flashing yellow lights and of
    the appellant penetrating her. She started yelling “what are you doing” and “let
    me go.” She recalled asking if the appellant was wearing a condom, and that
    Mr. R. told the appellant to do what she said. She also recalled that while
    the appellant was on top of her, Mr. R. was masturbating himself with one
    hand while holding a camera in the other hand and saying something to the
    effect of “fuck this is so great.” In addition, she recalled the appellant
    holding her head in the studio and telling her she was his girlfriend, to
    which she responded “fuck off.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s next memory is waking up alone and naked on the studio floor
    at around 4:00 a.m. She went upstairs, found both men sleeping in Mr. R.’s
    bed, and left. She saw her doctor on Thursday, May 23, 2002, and the doctor
    insisted that she report the matter to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified about feeling unwell as she drank her wine. In examination-in-chief
    she said her “head started not being normal” and that her understanding of
    what was going on was blurry.<b> </b>She said that things were becoming worse
    and worse as the photographs were being taken—the feeling in her head and
    her body “was becoming like not moveable.” After she smoked the cigarette
    it became worse again. She recalled that while the appellant was on top of
    her, she kept trying to get up but could not move; she said she felt like
    a “dead doll lying there.” In cross-examination, the complainant described
    feeling drowsy, “like [she] was falling somewhere.” She also said she could
    not concentrate on what was going on: “all that light [was] around [her],
    it was just like a movie [she] was watching.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his testimony at trial, the appellant acknowledged having sexual intercourse
    with the complainant on May 21, 2002, but claimed that she had initiated
    it and that it was consensual. Both the appellant and Mr. R. testified that
    although the complainant was initially somewhat reserved, as the evening
    wore on she became flirtatious. They stated that while in the studio, she
    began undressing Mr. R. and performing oral sex on the appellant. According
    to the appellant, he also performed oral sex on the complainant, and then

    that he was a regular user of GHB and had consumed some both before and after
    arriving at Mr. R.’s home. He said that when he returned from the washroom,
    he decided to consume the remaining GHB and that he mixed it with wine from
    the complainant’s wine glass. He stated that he then had consensual intercourse
    with the complainant. Mr. R. took a photograph of them having intercourse,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Robert Langille was qualified to give expert evidence concerning the absorption,
    distribution and elimination of alcohol and drugs in the human body and their
    effects on human behaviour. He described GHB as an acid that was first produced
    in the 1960s as a possible anaesthetic because of its significant sedating
    properties in relation to the central nervous system. At low concentrations
    (dosages of about one gram), individuals experience relaxation and euphoria,
    causing a decrease in social inhibitions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    increased concentrations (dosages of about two to three grams), the effects
    can include a decrease in alertness and mental functioning, an increase in
    drowsiness, and eventually sleep, dizziness and muscle “incoordination.”
    As the dosage is increased slightly beyond the two to three gram level, individuals
    will experience a deeper and deeper sleep; at approximately five grams they
    will become unconscious. Beyond that range, unconsciousness can increase
    to coma and eventually death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    GHB’s effects on rationality, Dr. Langille said that at sufficient doses,
    the drug decreases an individual’s awareness of what is going on around them
    as well as the brain’s ability to process information and make decisions.
    While GHB does not remove rationality, with increasing drowsiness and decreasing
    alertness, it slows and eventually stops an individual’s ability to think
    and respond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille described GHB as a drug of choice in a significant number of sexual
    assaults because it can be fairly well hidden in certain types of alcoholic
    beverages and has a rapid onset (about fifteen minutes at the two to three
    gram level). Further, he said that since alcohol is also a central nervous
    system depressant, the effects of these drugs will augment each other. Although
    he could not be precise about the extent of that augmentation, he said it
    would be significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille testified that the concentration of GHB in the complainant’s wine
    glass when it was seized on May 24, 2002 was 18 milligrams of GHB to 100
    millilitres of liquid (or about .03 grams of GHB in a full glass of wine).
    At this concentration, the complainant would have to have drunk seven to
    eight bottles of wine to consume one gram of GHB, the lowest intoxicating
    dose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Dr. Langille agreed that it appeared that the alcohol
    content of the wine in the complainant’s wine glass had been reduced through
    evaporation between May 21 and May 24, 2002. While the evaporation rate of
    GHB is unknown, it was likely that the concentration of GHB in the complainant’s
    wine would have been lower on May 21, 2002 than when it was tested on May
    24, 2002. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the trial judge
      err in failing to stay the charges against the appellant based on a violation
      of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claims that he brought a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application at
    trial and that the trial judge erred by failing to address it. In the alternative,
    he submits that this is an appropriate case in which to consider his application
    on appeal, even if he failed to bring a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    at trial, because he was in essentially the same position as Mr. R., a complete
    record of Mr. R.’s s. 11(b) application is available, and the trial judge
    erred in failing to stay the sexual assault charges against Mr. R. I reject
    these arguments for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I am not persuaded that the appellant brought a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    at trial. As already noted, on the first day of the joint trial (June 3,
    2004), the Crown indicated that she would not be proceeding with any charges
    other than the sexual assault charges against each accused. The appellant’s
    counsel then advised the trial judge that in order to preserve his client’s
    appeal rights, he proposed to file a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    and invite the trial judge to give the same ruling as he had given in relation
    to Mr. R. The trial judge rejected this proposal, saying that it would be
    without any apparent purpose having regard to the Crown’s position and that
    if an application were filed he would have to treat it seriously:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: …I didn’t join [the
    s. 11(b) application] at that time, for reasons that, at this point I think
    are not relevant. But what happened was I learned of the ruling and the reasons
    for it, and I had always maintained that the delay from November to today’s
    date may have assisted my client in terms of his, such an application. However
    based on, as I understand it, the reasons of Your Honour’s ruling, my client
    was essentially in the same position as Mr. [R.] vis-a-vis the two outstanding
    counts, counts one and five. So what I proposed to my learned friend was
    this. That for the purposes of preserving the record or my client’s appeal
    rights, that I would file a motion and invite the court essentially to rule
    in the same fashion as the Court did with Mr. [R.], that is to say, to dismiss
    the application vis-a-vis [the sexual assault charges]. And my learned friend
    had indicated that she would be withdrawing or not proceeding on the other
    counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>THE COURT: It seems to me
    that the issue of making or deciding the <i>Charter</i> application with
    respect to s. 11(b) is moot because the Crown has just indicated a moment
    ago that she’s not proceeding on the pornography related charges, nor any
    other charge, aside [from the sexual assault charges], so I have difficulty
    making any similar ruling in view of the Crown’s position, unless you can
    persuade me why I should, I don’t see what is to be gained from going through
    any kind of <i>Charter</i> application. Number one it will be a waste [of]
    time and number two I still would have to take it seriously and listen to
    evidence, perhaps prejudice, so I don’t believe in engaging in exercises
    that really are without any particular purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: I understand what Your
    Honour is saying. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>THE COURT: I appreciate
    that, thank you.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    assuming that the trial judge misunderstood the appellant’s June 3, 2004
    request as relating only to the child pornography charges, the appellant
    did nothing to correct that understanding. In particular, counsel made no
    oral submissions in response to the trial judge’s comments and did not file
    a written s. 11(b) application to clarify his intent. In the absence of such
    steps, I fail to see how the appellant can claim that he brought a s. 11(b)
    application on June 3, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, rather than being a serious attempt to bring a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    at trial, in my view, the appellant’s proposal was merely a tactical manoeuvre
    aimed at preserving the appellant’s right to raise on appeal issues that
    he could, and if he was serious about them, should have raised at trial.
    In particular, the appellant’s June 3, 2004 proposal was not that he would
    lead evidence and make submissions on a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application;
    on the contrary, he proposed to simply file an application and invite the
    trial judge to dismiss it on the same basis as Mr. R.’s application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there are no doubt circumstances in which it is appropriate for a trial judge
    to apply previously made rulings to a different context, in my opinion this
    is not one of them. The question of whether a particular accused’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> rights
    have been breached requires “a judicial determination balancing the interests
    which the section is designed to protect against factors which inevitably
    lead to delay or are otherwise the cause of delay”:<i> R. v. Morin</i> (1992),
    71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 13 (S.C.C.). Because these factors can vary from individual
    to individual, even where accused are jointly charged, in my view, the determination
    of whether a particular accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights have been breached
    will generally require individual determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is content for the purposes of this appeal to rely on the record
    filed on Mr. R’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application and he is not attempting
    to differentiate himself from Mr. R. in terms of waived time periods or to
    adduce evidence of specific prejudice. However, he did not make these acknowledgements
    before the trial judge. Further, to the extent he believed, as he contends
    on appeal, that the trial judge misapprehended certain evidence or misapplied
    the <i>Morin</i> factors in dealing with Mr. R.’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application,
    the appellant had the opportunity to raise those matters in an application
    on June 3, 2004 but chose not to do so. In my view, the appellant’s June
    3, 2004 proposal should not be regarded as a serious attempt to bring a s.
    11(b) <i>Charter</i> application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I reject the appellant’s alternative submission that this is an appropriate
    case in which he should be entitled to raise the issue of unreasonable delay
    on appeal despite the fact that he did not bring a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    courts are generally reluctant to entertain <i>Charter</i> arguments that
    are raised for the first time on appeal. This reluctance stems from concerns
    about prejudice to the other side arising from an inability to adduce necessary
    responding evidence at trial, the lack of a sufficient record to make necessary
    findings of fact, and society’s overarching interest in the finality of litigation: <i>R.
    v. Warsing</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 259 at 271-72 (S.C.C.);<i> R. v. Brown</i> (1993),
    83 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 133-34 (S.C.C.); and <i>R. v. R.R.</i> (1994), 91 C.C.C.
    (3d) 193 at 198-99 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> R.R</i>., <i>supra</i>,
    at 199, this court adopted the following portion of L’Heureux-Dubé J.’s discussion
    in <i>Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 133-134 about the importance of the finality
    of litigation, noting that although her comments were made in dissent, the
    majority did not take issue with her discussion of this principle:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…the general prohibition
    against new arguments on appeal supports the overarching societal interest
    in the finality of litigation in criminal matters. Were there to be no limits
    on the issues that may be raised on appeal, such finality would become an
    illusion. Both the Crown and the defence would face uncertainty, as counsel
    for both sides, having discovered that the strategy adopted at trial did
    not result in the desired or expected verdict, devised new approaches. Costs
    would escalate and the resolution of criminal matters would be spread out
    over years in the most routine cases. Moreover society’s expectation that
    criminal matters will be disposed of fairly and fully at the first instance
    and its respect for the administration of justice would be undermined. Juries
    would rightfully be uncertain if they were fulfilling an important societal
    function or merely wasting their time. For these reasons, courts have always
    adhered closely to that rule that such tactics will not be permitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As
    I have said, in this case, the appellant had every opportunity to raise at
    trial the issues he now seeks to raise for the first time on appeal. Not
    only could he have brought a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application at the same
    time as Mr. R., but, having obtained the benefit of the trial judge’s ruling
    on Mr. R.’s application, the appellant could have raised before the trial
    judge the precise issues he now seeks to raise on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has not alleged incompetence of counsel. Given the foregoing circumstances,
    in my view, the compelling inference is that the appellant chose not to raise
    a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> issue at trial for tactical reasons. For the reasons
    articulated in <i>Brown</i>, I conclude that such tactics should not be permitted
    and I would not allow the appellant to raise the s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> issue
    for the first time on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I am not, in any event, persuaded that the appellant has demonstrated that
    his s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> rights were infringed. The appellant relies on
    the record in Mr. R.’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application and claims that
    the trial judge erred in refusing to stay the sexual assault charges against
    Mr. R.. Accordingly, before turning to my analysis of this issue, I will
    review the chronology of the case as revealed in Mr. R.’s application as
    well as the trial judge’s reasons for dismissing that application. </p>

      Judge’s Ruling on Mr. R.’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the chronology of the case and the principles set out in <i>Morin</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the trial judge turned to the application of the <i>Morin</i> factors to
    this case. He made the following findings in relation to Mr. R.:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>i) Length of the delay</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    total delay of just over two years was sufficient to warrant an inquiry into
    the reasonableness of the delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>ii) Waiver of time periods</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was undisputed that the periods of waiver totalled approximately four months:
    September 1, 2003 to November 21, 2003 and November 21, 2003 to January 1,
    2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>iii) Reasons for the delay</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>  a) Inherent time requirements </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s assessment of an intake period of four months and one week (May 24,
    2002 to October 1, 2002) was reasonable as the case involved two accused
    charged with a total of seven serious offences, a lengthy investigation,
    voluminous disclosure and expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    deducting the intake period and waived time periods, the delay under consideration
    was sixteen months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>  b) Actions of the Crown
    and the accused</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was appropriate to analyze the child pornography charges and the sexual assault
    charges separately as they were unrelated and there were different reasons
    for delay in relation to each set of charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerning
    the child pornography charges, the Crown had not provided an adequate explanation
    for the eighteen month delay (from Mr. R.’s arrest until November 23, 2003)
    in disclosing the details of its case. Further, the timing and volume of
    this disclosure would have necessitated an adjournment of the trial of these
    charges in any event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerning
    the sexual assault charges, the Crown had disclosed the bulk of its case
    by October 1, 2002 and a trial date or preliminary hearing date could properly
    have been set as of that date. Since Mr. R. did not apply for a severance
    of these charges, he shared responsibility for their delay in proceeding.
    Non-disclosure of the e-mails Mr. R. requested on November 14, 2003 should
    not have precluded a severance application because remedies were available
    at trial if necessary evidence had been lost or misplaced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>c) Limits on institutional
    resources</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taking
    account of the eight months of waived time and the intake period, each hearing
    date had been set within the eight to ten month <i>Morin</i> guideline for
    institutional delay in the provincial courts: five months for the preliminary
    hearing; six months for the first trial date (i.e. up to the September date
    available for the court); and seven months for the second trial date. Based
    on the history and circumstances of this proceeding, “the ‘system’ was able
    to effectively respond to the need to have this case tried without unreasonable
    delay.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>iv) Prejudice to the accused  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.

    health problems, poor living conditions and a negative impact on his business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>v) Conclusions</p>

style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Balancing
    the <i>Morin</i> factors in relation to the child pornography charges, Mr.
    R.’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> rights in relation to these charges had been
    violated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    Mr. R. had established specific prejudice arising from his incarceration,
    taking account of the other <i>Morin</i> factors, including the reasons for
    the delay and the strong societal interest in having sexual assault cases
    proceed to trial, Mr. R.’s s. 11(b) rights in relation to the sexual assault
    charges had not been infringed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            C) Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claims that the trial judge erred in two respects in refusing to
    stay the sexual assault charges against Mr. R. First, he says the trial judge
    erred by holding Mr. R. responsible for delay in relation to the sexual assault
    charges because he failed to apply for a severance. Second, he says that
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning when the defence requested
    disclosure of the May 22, 2002 e-mail sent by Mr. R. to the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    accepting that the trial judge made the foregoing errors, taking into account
    the conduct of the appellant and Mr. R. in re-electing to be tried in the
    Ontario Court of Justice, Mr. R.’s adjournment request, and the other <i>Morin</i> factors,
    I agree with the trial judge that the total delay in this matter was not
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred when, under
    the heading “reasons for the delay—Actions of Crown and Applicant,” he attributed
    to Mr. R. shared responsibility for the delay in relation to the sexual assault
    charges because Mr. R. failed to apply for a severance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that it is the obligation of the
    Crown to bring an accused to trial and that an accused has no responsibility
    to take positive steps to press for a speedy trial: <i>Morin</i> at 23-24; <i>R.
    v. MacDougall</i> (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 483 at para. 58. Further, in <i>Morin</i>,
    Sopinka J. explained at p. 17 that it is voluntary actions taken by an accused
    that cause delay that are to be included under the heading “reasons for the
    delay—actions of the accused”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    while it is open to the court when assessing the extent of prejudice suffered
    by an accused to consider the accused’s inaction where it is inconsistent
    with a desire for a timely trial, “the court must be careful not to subvert
    the principle that there is no legal obligation on the accused to assert
    the right”: <i>Morin </i>at 24. Given these principles, in my view, at most
    the trial judge in this case may have been entitled to take Mr. R.’s failure
    to apply for a severance into account when assessing prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also accept that the trial judge misspoke when he said that Mr. R. only requested
    disclosure of his e-mails to the complainant on November 11, 2003. While
    it is true that Mr. R. requested disclosure of some e-mails on that date,
    he in fact had requested disclosure of the May 22, 2002 e-mail on September
    6, 2002. However, I am not persuaded that this misstatement materially affected
    the trial judge’s analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was satisfied that sufficient disclosure of the Crown’s case
    in relation to the sexual assault charges had been made as of October 1,
    2002 to permit a trial date to be set. I see no error in his conclusion.
    Although the e-mails were ultimately not disclosed until after Mr. R.’s s.
    11(b) application was argued, it is reasonable to assume that disclosure
    could have been made earlier had the fact that they were not in the November
    23, 2003 disclosure package been discovered sooner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the situation with the child pornography charges, the missing e-mails were
    not voluminous and there is no reason to believe that late disclosure would
    have caused an adjournment of the trial. Moreover, as was noted by the trial
    judge, Mr. R. had remedies available at trial if the e-mails were not produced
    and their non-disclosure impaired his ability to make full answer and defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the non-disclosure of these e-mails provides little support for
    the appellant’s position. I see no indication in the record that he requested
    disclosure of the e-mails from Mr. R. to the complainant and he has not demonstrated
    that they impacted his defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the foregoing errors, in my view, the trial judge did not err in finding
    that the total delay between the date of the appellant’s arrest and the date
    of trial was not unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    important aspect of the trial judge’s reasons was his observation that the
    court was in a position to set each of the hearing dates in this matter (the
    preliminary inquiry, the first trial date and the second trial date) within
    the <i>Morin</i> guidelines for institutional delay in the provincial courts.
    Particularly in light of this observation, in my opinion, it would have been
    entirely appropriate for the trial judge to consider Mr. R.’s decision on
    February 27, 2003 to re-elect trial in the Ontario Court of Justice under
    the heading “reasons for delay - actions of the accused”:  see <i>Morin </i>at
    17-18. Had Mr. R. (and the appellant) elected trial in the Ontario Court
    of Justice from the outset, a trial date would have been set at the pre-trial
    on October 2, 2002 rather than a preliminary inquiry date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    from this perspective, the fact that the preliminary inquiry Crown was not
    ready to proceed to trial on February 27, 2003 is of little consequence.
    February 27, 2003 was not the trial date, the preliminary inquiry Crown was
    only informed of the decision to re-elect about a week prior to the hearing
    and, in any event, the trial could not have been completed in the two days
    set for the preliminary inquiry. Most importantly, however, rather than delaying
    setting a trial date until February 27, 2003, the trial date would have been
    set in October 2002.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although the appellant did not waive the time periods waived by Mr. R. arising
    from Mr. R.’s two adjournment applications in November 2002, I would classify
    those time periods as neutral vis-à-vis the appellant. In <i>R. v. Whylie</i> (2006),
    207 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 24, citing <i>R. v. Sapara </i>(2001), 277 A.R.
    357 at paras. 57-58  (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) leave to appeal refused, [2001] 2 S.C.R. xii, this court observed that “ordinarily
    delay caused by the actions of a co-accused is considered neutral in the
    s. 11(b) analysis.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is because, generally speaking, it is in the interests of justice that individuals
    charged jointly with an offence be tried together. “A single trial for two
    or more accuseds generally conserves judicial resources, avoids inconsistent
    verdicts, and avoids witnesses having to testify more than once”: <i>Whylie</i> at
    para. 24. As was noted in <i>Whylie</i>, severance will rarely be granted.
    Given these principles, delay caused by the actions of a co-accused ordinarily
    will not be attributable to the Crown or to the absence of institutional
    resources. I would therefore characterize the two month period from November
    2003 to January 2004 as neutral vis-à-vis the appellant. Since Mr. R.’s counsel
    was ready to proceed in January 2004 but the first available court dates
    were not until June 2004, I would classify that six month period as institutional
    delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    account of the foregoing analysis, in my opinion, the reasons for the delay
    in this matter vis-à-vis the appellant can properly be characterized as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            May 27, 2002-Oct.
    2, 2002             4 months        intake              neutral</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Oct. 2, 2002-Feb.
    27, 2003             5 months        re-election     accused</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Feb. 27, 2003-Sept.
    2003                6 months        set trial date   institutional</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Sept. 2003-Nov.
    2003                      2 months        counsel           accused</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>            Nov. 2003-Jan. 2004                        2 months        co-accused     neutral</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>                                                                                                counsel</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Jan. 2004-June
    30, 2004                  6 months        set trial date   institutional</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    out of a total delay of twenty-five months, four months are attributable
    to intake time and are neutral; seven months are attributable to the actions
    of the appellant; two months are attributable to the unavailability of defence
    counsel for Mr. R. and are neutral vis-à-vis the appellant; and twelve months
    are attributable to institutional delay, i.e<i>.</i>, the period of delay
    that begins to run when the parties are ready for trial but the system cannot
    accommodate them: <i>Morin</i> at 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Morin</i> guideline
    for institutional delay in the provincial courts is eight to ten months.
    However, the guideline is just that—a guideline. It is not a fixed limitation
    period, nor is it to be applied in a mechanical fashion: <i>Morin</i> at
    19-20. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, an important feature of this case is that six out of the twelve
    months of institutional delay arose because counsel for the co-accused was
    unavailable for the original trial date due to a homicide trial that was
    not completed within the estimated time frame. While it is no doubt desirable
    that in-custody cases that must be adjourned be re-scheduled on a more expedited
    basis than occurred here, the reality of this case is that the sexual assault
    charges alone required ten days for trial, making it a challenging case to
    re-schedule in most, if not all, of the busy provincial courts in the Greater
    Metropolitan Toronto area. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge observed, it is preferable for all involved that serious
    cases such as this not be heard on a piecemeal basis. Given this factor and
    the need to allocate judicial resources in the Ontario Court of Justice in
    a way that best responds to the nature and volume of the cases in that court,
    I agree with the trial judge that it would be unrealistic to expect that
    a ten day trial such as this could be rescheduled immediately following an
    adjournment, even where in-custody accused are involved. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    saying this, I do not intend to suggest that the government may use a heavy
    caseload as an excuse for any lack of resources in the Ontario Court of Justice.
    However, the <i>Morin</i> guideline recognizes that some period of institutional
    delay in scheduling cases is not unreasonable. As a general matter, that
    period should be shorter rather than longer where in-custody accused are
    involved. Nevertheless, in my view, the realities of scheduling in a world
    where resources are not unlimited means that, even in in-custody matters,
    the period of reasonable delay may be extended somewhat where a case is complex
    or lengthy and is adjourned to accommodate an accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this respect, I consider it at least noteworthy that the appellant re-elected
    trial in the Ontario Court of Justice after he learned the identity of the
    preliminary inquiry judge. In so doing, he was able to pick his trial judge,
    but he also selected a forum for trial that is unlikely to have the same
    flexibility as the Superior Court in rescheduling cases that may have to
    be adjourned. Further, in requesting that a particular judge become seized
    of the case, the appellant might reasonably have expected that there would
    be even less flexibility in the event of any necessary re-scheduling. These
    factors attenuate the degree of prejudice attributable to the appellant somewhat.
    Moreover, unlike Mr. R., the appellant did not present evidence establishing
    specific prejudice relating to his incarceration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    was noted by the trial judge, in <i>R. v. Regan</i> (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d)
    97 at para. 116, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    recognized that sex offences are particularly serious charges and that there
    is a strong societal interest in seeing them through to a trial on the merits.
    While the fact that the appellant was in custody throughout the period leading
    up to his trial undoubtedly caused prejudice, balancing all of the <i>Morin</i> factors,
    I am not persuaded that the overall delay in bringing him to trial on the
    sexual assault charges was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Did the trial judge
      misapprehend certain pieces of key evidence?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            A) The toxicologist’s
      evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the portion of his reasons in which he reviewed the evidence, the trial judge
    stated that the toxicologist “was of the view that the concentration of [GHB
    in the complainant’s wine glass] would have been lower on May 24 than on
    May 21.” Later, in the analysis portion of his reasons when dealing with
    the issue of whether the Crown had proven that the appellant added GHB to
    the complainant’s wine, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It was contended by the
    defence that the small amount of GHB that was in the seized wine glass was
    such that the effects of the drug could not have incapacitated [the complainant].
    The difficulty with this argument is that the wine glass used by the complainant
    was seized three days after the incident. According to Dr. Langille, a certain
    amount of evaporation to both the alcohol and GHB content would have occurred.
    As well, the description of the complainant’s incapacity that evening as
    described by her is consistent with being drugged by the combination of GHB
    and alcohol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same section of his analysis, the trial judge also said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[The complainant’s] account
    of events, including her incapacity to think, move and remember events is
    consistent with the effects of GHB, particularly when combined with alcohol
    as described in the testimony by Dr. Langille.</p>

    to the trial judge’s finding, Dr. Langille testified that he did not know
    exactly how GHB and alcohol would interact. Further, Dr. Langille specifically
    testified that the loss of memory the complainant described was a known effect
    of alcohol and not of GHB. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that these misapprehensions are material because they taint
    the trial judge’s finding that the complainant was drugged. The appellant
    claims that because of the first and second errors, the trial judge failed
    to recognize that the concentrations of GHB in the complainant’s wine glass
    on May 21, 2002 were insignificant and could not have incapacitated the complainant.
    In addition, because of the third error, the trial judge wrongly concluded
    that the complainant’s patchy memory was consistent with her being drugged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the first alleged error, I agree that the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence relating to the concentrations of GHB in the complainant’s wine
    glass. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  In
    his evidence, Dr. Langille made it clear that it was his opinion that the
    concentration of GHB in the complainant’s wine glass would have been lower
    on May 21, 2002 than it was on May 24, 2002. During cross-examination, he
    expressly agreed with a suggestion by Mr. R.’s counsel to that effect: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: Just to make sure that
    we are clear, what you’re saying to us is that on May 21<sup>st</sup> the
    concentration of GHB in that quantity of liquid would be lower than what
    it was on the 24<sup>th</sup>, but you just can’t tell us how much lower?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.: Yes, that’s correct.
    It could be a trivial amount, it could be somewhat more.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the second alleged error, in my view, it was open to the trial judge to draw
    an inference from Dr. Langille’s evidence that the GHB may have dissipated
    to some extent due to the effects of evaporation. In particular, Dr. Langille
    testified that a substance’s evaporation rate depends on the relationship
    of the substance’s boiling point to the boiling point of water. Substances
    with a lower boiling point than water evaporate more quickly, while substances
    with a similar or higher boiling point than water evaporate more slowly,
    if at all. Dr. Langille testified that the boiling point of GHB is unknown,
    but that GHB maintains itself in equilibrium to gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL),
    which has a boiling point just higher than water. Dr. Langille said, “as
    the GBL is evaporated at about the same rate as the water, some of the GHB
    will then be lost as it maintains that equilibrium.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if the trial judge misapprehended Dr. Langille’s evidence concerning
    both the concentrations of GHB in the complainant’s wine glass and evaporation,
    I am not persuaded that these errors taint his finding that the complainant
    was incapacitated as the result of being drugged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the anchor to the trial judge’s finding that the complainant was
    incapacitated as the result of being drugged was his conclusion that she “was
    in a drugged condition as she consumed her second and third glasses of wine
    well before any sexual activity began.” The fact that the concentration of
    GHB in the complainant’s wine glass may have been insufficient to incapacitate
    her after she drank her third or fourth glass of wine, or after the appellant
    used her wine glass to mix GHB for himself, does not undermine this finding.
    Based on the trial judge’s findings, the complainant was already in a drugged
    condition before she consumed her third glass of wine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s finding that the complainant was
    incapacitated as the result of consuming drugs is nonetheless tainted by
    his misapprehension of Dr. Langille’s evidence. This is because the trial
    judge did not rely on his finding concerning when the complainant began experiencing
    the effects of GHB to reject the argument that the concentration of GHB in
    the complainant’s wine glass could not have caused her to become incapacitated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission. The trial judge’s finding that the complainant
    began to experience the effects of GHB as she consumed her second glass of
    wine was not premised on his erroneous statement about the concentration
    of GHB that would have been in her wine glass on May 21, 2002. Further, the
    trial judge’s finding about when the complainant began to experience the
    effects of GHB undermines the foundation of the appellant’s argument whether
    the trial judge recognized that fact or not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the third alleged error, the appellant relies on the following three excerpts
    from Dr. Langille’s evidence to submit that Dr. Langille testified that he
    did not know how alcohol and GHB interacted and that, as far as he was aware,
    memory lapses were not a known effect of GHB but rather were an effect of
    alcohol:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Ist excerpt</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: Is it possible for ones,
    for this, is it possible while consuming GH[B] along with consuming alcohol
    simultaneously, is it possible to have clarity come and go, ones understanding
    or ones awareness come and go, in other words [to] come to and not…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.: That wouldn't be my
    understanding of someone significantly sedated with both GH[B] and alcohol,
    but however [it] is an effect of intoxication due to alcohol. However since
    it hasn't been well studied, I can't categorically state that that can not
    happen, that the general route though of intoxication with GH[B] even on
    top of alcohol where the individual is unconscious and goes to hospital,
    is that the only time they actually wake up is during the dawning effect.
    If they… </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: That's for individuals
    who are unconscious?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.: That's correct.</p>

    that occur for some of this time period. And would be less consistent and
    [in fact] likely not consistent with GH[B] alone... But it's possible that
    that could in fact occur with a combination of a lower dose of GH[B] and
    alcohol. The effects of that low dose though wouldn't last, in my opinion,
    beyond the first two hours. So that if this activity in fact lasted until
    4 o'clock that wouldn't be consistent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>3<sup>rd</sup> excerpt</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: And if I were to
    … suggest that perhaps during this period of time before intercourse is occurring
    perhaps this woman is in fact engaging in sexual activity that she has no
    recollection of, would that be consistent with the consumption of GH[B] and
    alcohol?... Sexual activity, let me say sexual activity that she normally
    would not engage in where she's sober. Are you able to answer that?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.: You haven't, I guess
    what you haven't told me is whether or not this individual was, is alleged
    to have been unconscious at the time or was conscious but just has no memory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.: Conscious, but has no
    memory, I'm sorry. Actually, engaging in an activity, for instance performing
    oral sex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.: Generally individuals
    will have complete blackout of all memory with alcohol only when they are
    heavy abusers of alcohol and experience alcoholic blackouts. I can't find
    any definitive literature that states that GH[B] produce[s] that type of
    an amens—when consumed orally. So I'm not in a position to state that that
    would be consistent with GH[B] and alcohol. My understanding is generally
    the amount of awareness will, what's going on, will decrease in tandem with
    the decrease in consciousness, and individuals can have memory [deficits],
    but not generally, complete unawareness for a long period of time, unless
    they've been heavy abusers, at least of alcohol, and it's unclear what the
    combined effects of GHB and alcohol would have in that particular state.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the first and third excerpts relied on by the appellant are of no
    assistance to him because they relate to scenarios that do not accord with
    the trial judge’s findings. The first excerpt relates to individuals who
    are unconscious as the result of consuming GHB and alcohol, whereas the trial
    judge simply found that the complainant was sedated. The third excerpt is
    part of a hypothetical question in which the Crown posited that the complainant
    performed oral sex on the appellant (in accordance with the appellant’s claim)
    and that she had no recollection of doing so and asked Dr. Langille to comment
    on whether that scenario was consistent with the combined use of GHB and
    alcohol. However, the trial judge did not accept the appellant’s version
    of the events, making this aspect of the hypothetical irrelevant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, the second excerpt from Dr. Langille’s evidence relied on by
    the appellant is not inconsistent with the trial judge’s findings. Moreover,
    there was at least one other portion of Dr. Langille’s evidence that suggested
    that patchy memory could be a possible side effect of combined alcohol and
    GHB use:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Is it possible, when
    combined with alcohol … to have an awareness, more clarity of awareness that
    might come and go?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. What I can tell you is
    that in general with most central nervous system depressants, where an individual
    is not unconscious, that they are in a state of sedation and are still arous[ed]
    by some type of strong stimulants, that it is possible that those individual[s]
    will become aroused, [that] they will have an increase, transient and small
    increase in their adrenaline … which will, to some limited degree counteract
    the effects of CNS depressants such as alcohol, and likely this would also
    counter to some degree, but it’s not clear, a depressant such as GH[B]. In
    my experience, it’s common for individuals to respond to strong stimulus
    and be able to then have period of recollection, to be able to, because of
    their intoxicated state, they’re unable to maintain that, and they then in
    the parlance pass out again. That seems [to be] the common feature of people
    who are significantly intoxicated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Well, when you use the
    word intoxication, are you speaking only of alcohol or of GH[B], or a combination
    of both?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Or of any central nervous
    system depressants.</p>

'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    experienced a similar feeling of blurriness, she was describing only how
    she felt as she began to feel unwell:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        [At] that point I remember very well

    appellant submits that the trial judge’s finding that the complainant lacked
    the capacity to consent to sexual activity is unreasonable. He relies on
    case law establishing a low threshold for a finding of capacity, and in particular,
    cases in which it has been held that drunkenness or loss of inhibitions and
    self-control do not amount to a lack of capacity: <i>R. v. Cedeno</i> (2005),
    195 C.C.C. (3d) 468 (Ont. Ct. J.); <i>R. v. Jensen</i> (1996), 106 C.C.C.

    the appellant submits that the evidence establishes that the complainant
    was sufficiently conscious to be capable of giving a valid consent. In particular,
    the appellant claims that Dr. Langille testified that GHB would not have
    caused the complainant to lose awareness of what was going on around her,
    but rather would simply have affected her ability to recall events afterwards.
    Further, the appellant relies on the complainant’s description of her surroundings
    and Mr. R.’s activities while she was engaged in intercourse, together with
    her evidence that she was sufficiently conscious to ask Mr. R. if the appellant
    was wearing protection and to tell the appellant to let her go, as demonstrating
    that she had the capacity to give a valid consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept these submissions. In my view, the appellant has taken a portion
    of Dr. Langille’s testimony out of context. When Dr. Langille said “[i]t’s
    not that an individual has no awareness of what’s going on, but afterwards
    has no clear memory of what took place,” he was describing a study that involved
    injecting GHB intravenously to test its effect in producing forward amnesia
    as compared to Valium for pre-anaesthetic purposes. Dr. Langille did not
    testify that GHB would have the same effects when taken orally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge correctly identified the test for capacity to
    consent as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In order for the complainant
    to be found to have lacked the capability of consenting, [the complainant]
    must have been intoxicated to the point where she could not understand the
    sexual nature of the act or realize that she could choose to decline to participate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the trial judge described the complainant’s state of mind on May 21, 2002
    as follows: “She was experiencing real difficulty thinking and moving”; “she
    became increasingly drowsy”; “[she] was unable to concentrate and felt like
    she was watching herself in a movie”; and “she was unable to concentrate,
    get up off the floor and certainly unable to engage in any decision-making
    process about whether to engage in sexual activity.”
    Although the trial judge was satisfied that the complainant became fully
    conscious while the appellant was having intercourse with her, he found this
    consistent with Dr. Langille’s evidence that a person who is sedated may
    become aroused by strong stimuli.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>As already stated, the Crown
    has satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] drugged the
    complainant without her knowledge. The evidence establishes that the degree
    of intoxication by the combination of GHB and alcohol caused [the complainant]
    to lose her capacity to consent to have sex with [the appellant]. The complete
    loss of inhibition that she experienced was the direct result of being drugged
    by [the appellant]. She was sufficiently sedated to have lost her ability
    to consent to or to resist the sexual activity with [the appellant]. She
    was sufficiently sedated that she could not voluntarily agree to engage in
    sexual activity with him. [The complainant] cannot be said to have given
    a valid consent to [the appellant] where she engaged in sexual activity because
    she had been drugged without her consent.</p>
