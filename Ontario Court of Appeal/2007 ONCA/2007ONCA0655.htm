    automobile collision raises two sets of issues.  The first, whether the trial judge, O’Connor J., was required to give
    the jury a special instruction concerning the frailties of eyewitness evidence
    of events.  The second, whether blood and
    breath samples were seized in accordance with the law, including the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  I have concluded that the special instruction
    was not required in the particular context of this case.  I am also satisfied that the blood and breath
    samples were properly taken.  I would
    therefore dismiss the appeal from conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also appeals from the sentence totalling twenty-one
    months imprisonment. He argues that the trial judge erred in principle in
    refusing to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment and that, in any
    event, the sentence is excessive.  I
    would also dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 6, 2001 at around 9:45 p.m. the appellant’s
    vehicle collided with a vehicle driven by Henry Belanger.  As a result of the collision, Mr. Belanger
    was killed and his daughter, Madeline Henwood, was injured.  The appellant was also injured.  Some witnesses at the scene, including an
    off-duty police officer, noted that the appellant had been drinking.  The off-duty officer told the officer in
    charge of the investigation at the scene, Sergeant Ronald Gignac, that he
    thought the appellant had alcohol on his breath.  Sergeant Gignac assigned Constable Nicole Randall
    to stay with the appellant.  The presence
    of Constable Randall in the ambulance and at the hospital became one of the
    foundations for the appellant’s argument that the seizure of blood and breath
    violated his <i>Charter </i>rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the important issues in the case was whether the
    appellant, who was travelling north, had crossed over into the victims’ lane or
    whether the victims’ car crossed over into the appellant’s lane.  Robert Andrews was driving the second car
    behind the Belanger vehicle.  He
    testified that he saw the appellant’s vehicle cross into the southbound
    lane.  Ms. Henwood testified to the same
    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a police officer.  He was not on duty at the time of the
    collision.  Rather, he was returning from
    a family event where, he admits, he had been drinking.  He testified that just before the collision,
    he was distracted when his pager went off and he looked down at it.  He also testified, however, that he did not
    cross over into the other lane. There was also evidence that the appellant’s vehicle
    veered off the paved surface of the road a short time before the
    collision.  The appellant denied leaving
    the paved surface at any time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown and defence each called expert accident
    reconstruction evidence.  The Crown
    expert testified that the collision occurred in the Belangers’ lane.  The defence expert disagreed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To prove that the appellant’s ability to drive was
    impaired by alcohol, the Crown not only led evidence of drinking, but also relied
    on the results of analysis of blood samples taken at the hospital for medical
    purposes and the results of an Intoxilyer test performed by the police at the
    hospital.  An expert witness testified
    that based on these results, the appellant’s blood alcohol level was somewhere
    between 130 and 210 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood at the
    time of the collision.  The expert concluded
    that if the appellant’s testimony as to how much he had drunk was accepted then
    his blood alcohol level would have been less than 50 milligrams of alcohol in
    100 millilitres of blood at the time of the collision.</p>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the appellant and Mr. Andrews testified that they were sure of their observations.
    Defence counsel cross-examined Mr. Andrews on his statement to the police
    the day after the accident in which he said, &ldquo;As far as I could tell
    I&rsquo;m pretty positive it was the guy who was coming northbound that crossed
    the centre line.&rdquo;  In his testimony before the jury, Mr. Andrews insisted
    that he had seen the northbound car cross into the oncoming traffic, and
    that this was not simply an opinion or a reconstruction of events. Under
    cross-examination, he agreed that he was not paying particular attention
    to the Belanger vehicle and that the events occurred very quickly. He also
    agreed that the wording of his statement suggested some reservation on his
    part. In re-examination, Crown counsel referred to the statement and asked
    Mr. Andrews whether he had any reservations about his testimony of what he
    saw. Mr. Andrews responded that he did not have any reservations: &ldquo;I
    saw what I saw, and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;  When questioned about his
  degree of confidence, he said he was &ldquo;totally confident&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his jury address, defence counsel summarized his
    cross-examination of Mr.&nbsp;Andrews and emphasized his statement to the
    police.  In his jury address, Crown
    counsel summarized Mr. Andrews’ direct examination and quoted verbatim from his
    re-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the pre-charge conference, counsel for the appellant
    sought a special instruction concerning Mr. Andrews’ evidence.  In light of the re-examination and the
    emphasis placed upon it by Crown counsel in his jury address, the defence
    wanted the trial judge to instruct the jury that witnesses’ confidence is
    unrelated to their reliability.  The
    trial judge refused to give the instruction.  The appellant argues that this was an error of law in the circumstances
    of this case.  In my view, the
    instruction was not required. To understand why, it is necessary to appreciate
    the structure of the jury charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge to the jury, the trial judge gave the
    usual instructions concerning the assessment of testimony.  For example, he told the jury to consider
    whether the witness seemed able to make accurate and complete observations
    about the event and whether the witness had a good opportunity to do so.  He said to consider the circumstances under
    which the observations were made and whether the event itself was unusual or
    routine.  He also told the jury to
    consider whether the witness seemed to be reporting what he or she saw or was
    simply putting together an account based on information obtained from other
    sources.  He cautioned the jury not to
    jump to conclusions based entirely on how a witness had testified since “looks
    can be deceiving”.  He warned, “There are
    simply too many variables to make the manner in which a witness testifies the
    only or most important fact in your decision.”  All of these instructions had particular application to Mr. Andrews
    given the defence position that Mr. Andrews was not paying particular attention
    at the time of the collision and had, in effect, reconstructed events after the
    fact, as demonstrated by his statement given to the police the day following
    the collision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the trial judge came to discuss prior inconsistent
    statements, he used Mr.&nbsp;Andrews as an example.  He highlighted the apparent contradiction
    between Mr.&nbsp;Andrews’ testimony and his police statement. He reminded the jury
    of Mr. Andrews’ explanation that the phrase “As far as I could tell” was simply
    a figure of speech.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred again to Mr. Andrews’ evidence
    on several more occasions when dealing with the questions of impairment and the
    location of the collision.  Each time, he
    also reminded the jury of the appellant’s evidence to the contrary. When
    summarizing the Crown theory, the trial judge said this about Mr. Andrews’
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Robert
    Andrews was wholly independent, sober and in an excellent position to see the
    collision.  He testified that Mr.&nbsp;LaChappelle
    crossed into the southbound lane, causing the collision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge never referred to Mr. Andrews’
    re-examination in his charge to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel objected to the charge to the
    jury.  He asked for an instruction concerning
    witness confidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Your Honour,
    with regard to Andrews I would ask for an instruction that when a witness says
    I saw what I saw, those are often the last thing that an accused hears before
    being wrongfully convicted. I mean that’s – my friend just argued that to the
    jury, that when a witness says I saw what I saw, and is confident that that’s
    something they should rely on, and in my submission they receive an instruction
    that when witnesses say they – I saw what I saw and I’m confident, that in fact
    that is completely unrelated to the reliability of their evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge refused to give the instruction, concluding
    that the general instructions about witness reliability were sufficient.  After deliberating for several hours, the
    jury asked for Mr. Andrews’ testimony and his statement.  Defence counsel repeated his request for the
    special instruction.  The trial judge
    took time to consider the matter, but decided not to give the instruction.  He repeated that he was satisfied that the
    general instructions were sufficient and that the special instruction would place
    undue emphasis on this aspect of the witness’ evidence.  The trial judge gave to the jury a transcript
    of Mr. Andrews’ evidence, which, of course, included the re-examination.  The jury returned with a guilty verdict just over
    two hours later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on eyewitness identification cases
    to support his submission that the special instruction was required in this
    case.  In <i>R. v. Hibbert</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at para. 52,
    Arbour J. suggested that in that case it would have been “prudent” for the
    trial judge to have emphasized for the jury “the very weak link between the
    confidence level of a witness and the accuracy of that witness”.  In <i>R.
    v. Knox</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 76 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Laskin J.A. held that it was
    problematic for the trial judge to suggest that the jury consider the identifying
    witness’ own certainty about his identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the need for a <i>Hibbert</i>-type instruction is not limited
    to eyewitness cases but can also apply in other circumstances where there is a
    risk that the jury will be misled into believing that the witness’ own
    confidence in the reliability of his or her observations is relevant.  He submits that the experience of the law, as
    gained from identification cases, about the danger of the trier of fact giving
    weight to witness confidence applies with equal force to analogous
    circumstances.  He submits that those
    circumstances existed here: the witness’ evidence depended upon a very brief
    observation of a startling event and the prosecution relied upon the witness’
    confidence as a factor to support the reliability of the observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel disagrees.  He submits that there is a fundamental distinction between
    eyewitness identification and testimony of an event. He submits that eyewitness
    identification is in reality an opinion, the expression of which can make
    a dramatic and unjustified impact on a jury. Testimony of an event, by contrast,
    is testimony concerning a fact; it does not suffer from the same inherent
    frailties. I cannot agree with Crown counsel&rsquo;s submission. The issue
    is not whether identification is an opinion and testimony of an event is
    a fact, but whether witnesses&rsquo; own confidence in the accuracy of their
    observations and recollections is a relevant factor. In the circumstances
    of this case, the witness&rsquo; own confidence in the reliability of his
    observations was of little relevance in considering the accuracy of those
    observations. That said, it may be that testimony about events may not have
    the same dramatic or persuasive impact as eyewitness identification evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in my view the principal reason for the
    admission of the evidence of the witness’ confidence was not to bolster the
    reliability of his observations, but rather to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility
    had been damaged in cross-examination. Defence counsel forcefully
    cross-examined the witness on his statement to the police to suggest that he
    had changed his story and that his tentative observation shortly after the
    event had evolved into a more confident recollection.  The statement was used to undermine the witness’
    credibility.  It was open to Crown
    counsel in those circumstances to attempt to rehabilitate the witness by
    establishing, if possible, that his recollection had always been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The special charge was unnecessary. Not only had
    defence counsel vigorously cross-examined Mr. Andrews on this issue, but the
    trial judge had also, in his general instructions, pinpointed the important
    factors for the jury to consider in assessing the reliability of Mr. Andrews’
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is not like <i>Knox</i>. In <i>Knox</i> the trial
    judge suggested that the jury could consider an eyewitness’ own certainty in
    assessing reliability. Here, the trial judge made no such assertion, even when
    he referred to the Crown’s theory that Mr. Andrews’ confidence in his
    observations was a relevant consideration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, a special charge likely would not have
    benefited the appellant. As Crown counsel pointed out at trial, the appellant
    had used language similar to Mr. Andrews’ in describing the location of the
    collision. The jury could have easily applied any special instruction to this
    testimony as well. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, and notwithstanding the undoubted
    importance of Mr. Andrews’ evidence, I am not persuaded that the failure to
    give the special instruction constituted an error. Therefore, to use the
    language of <i>Hibbert</i>, while it might
    have been prudent for the trial judge to have given the requested instruction,
    his failure to do so did not constitute an error of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>

    the admissibility of the blood samples and the breath samples.  Many of those same arguments are made on appeal.  I will first describe the factual context
    that led to the seizure of the blood samples and the taking of the breath
    samples and then deal with the various arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant had been drinking, Constable Randall was assigned by her superior to
    stay with the appellant.  In the result,
    she rode with him in the ambulance and stayed at his side for some of the time
    he was in the hospital.  There was no
    suggestion that her presence interfered with any treatment that the appellant
    needed either in the ambulance or in the hospital.  Further, the ambulance and hospital staff
    consented to Constable Randall’s presence, and the appellant at no time
    objected to her presence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the ambulance, Constable Randall noted an odour of
    alcohol on the appellant and that he was answering the paramedics’ questions
    with one-word answers and hand gestures as if he was attempting to avoid
    talking.  Randall did not speak to the
    appellant while he was in the ambulance.  She remained with the appellant at the hospital except when he went for
    X-rays.  Again she noticed that the
    appellant appeared to be trying to avoid talking, instead using gestures or
    one-word answers.  About thirty minutes
    after they arrived at the hospital, Randall saw the appellant put some gum in
    his mouth.  She told him he should not be
    eating anything.  At this time, the
    appellant recognized Randall as an officer with whom he had attended

    College.  He addressed her by name.  Randall noted that his speech was slurred,
    his eyes were red and bloodshot, and he still had an odour of alcohol around
    him.</p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three minutes later, on orders from a physician, a
    nurse took five vials of blood for medical purposes.  The appellant did not object to the taking of
    the blood samples.  The vials remained in
    Randall’s sight until another officer, Detective Constable Scherer, arrived at
    the hospital.  That officer watched the
    vials until they were placed in a laboratory refrigerator.  At that time, he placed Centre of Forensic
    Sciences seals on the remaining vials.  A
    hospital technician testified that if further medical tests had been needed,
    she could have broken the seals and used the vials.  She also testified that vials of blood that
    are not necessary for medical purposes are ordinarily destroyed.  Two days later, Detective Constable Scherer
    called the hospital and confirmed the existence of a blood chemistry
    report.  He then obtained a search
    warrant to seize the vials and the report, which contained a blood/alcohol analysis.  </p>

    were taken, the appellant went for X-rays.  Constable Randall did not accompany him.  While the appellant was gone, Randall concluded that she had grounds to
    arrest the appellant for impaired driving.  Accordingly, when he returned, Randall arrested the appellant for
    impaired driving.  She read the appellant
    his rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter </i>and
    made a breath demand.  The appellant said
    that he understood the demand and would comply.  He then said he wished to speak to duty counsel.  The appellant had a fifteen minute private
    conversation with duty counsel.  After
    the call, the appellant told Randall that duty counsel had informed him that
    the other driver had died (Randall had provided this information to duty
    counsel).  Randall told the appellant
    that the charge would now be impaired driving causing death.  She asked him if he still wanted to provide
    breath samples.  The appellant
    agreed.  The samples were given about
    four hours after the collision.</p>

    the breath tests and analysis of the blood samples.  The appellant raises the following issues
    concerning the admissibility of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    presence of Constable Randall in the ambulance violated the appellant’s privacy

    Constable Scherer violated the appellant’s right to protection against
    unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> when he placed seals on the vials of blood that had been
    taken for medical purposes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    Randall detained the appellant while he was in the ambulance and the hospital
    and therefore violated his rights under ss. 9 and 10 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    Randall did not make the breath demand as soon as practicable and therefore the
    breath demand was not lawfully made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    appellant’s s. 10(b) rights were violated because he did not receive competent
    advice from duty counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    combined effect of these various infringements violated the appellant’s rights

    Constable Randall remained with him in the ambulance while he was transported
    to the hospital.  He argues that
    Constable Randall violated his right to privacy and seized information from him
    by observing his interaction with the ambulance personnel.  This information was later used by Constable
    Randall to form her grounds for the breath demand and may have been some of the
    information used by Detective Constable Scherer to obtain the search warrant.</p>

    non-intrusive presence with the consent of the ambulance personnel did not
    breach the appellant’s reasonable expectation of privacy.  He principally relied upon a decision of
    Durno J. in <i>R. v. Colbourne</i> (1998), 19 M.V.R. (4th) 1 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen.
    Div.)) aff’d (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ).  Accordingly, he found there was no violation
    of the appellant’s s. 8 rights in the ambulance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the mere fact that Constable Randall
    accompanied the appellant in the ambulance did not violate his s. 8 rights,
    even if the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to
    the ambulance.  Section 8 is only engaged
    if there is a search or seizure.  In this
    case, the appellant claims that information was seized by Constable Randall
    because she was able to observe his interaction with the ambulance attendants.  The Supreme Court has dealt with
    informational privacy in several cases.  In <i>R. v. Plant</i> (1993), 84
    C.C.C. (3d) 203 at 212 (S.C.C.) para. 26.  Sopinka J. set out the factors to consider where the protection afforded
    by s. 8 with respect to informational privacy has allegedly been violated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Consideration of such factors as the nature of the
    information itself, the nature of the relationship between the party releasing
    the information and the party claiming its confidentiality, the place where the
    information was obtained, the manner in which it was obtained, and the
    seriousness of the crime being investigated, allow for a balancing of the
    societal interests in protecting individual dignity, integrity and autonomy
    with effective law enforcement. It is, then, necessary to apply this contextual
    approach to the facts of the case at bar.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, when the <i>Plant</i> factors are considered, the appellant did not make out a
    violation of his s. 8 rights.  The
    information about which the appellant complains was Constable Randall’s
    observations that the appellant was communicating using one-word answers or
    gestures.  She inferred from this conduct
    that the appellant was attempting not to speak.  This kind of information was not of a highly confidential nature.  Constable Randall was able to make the same
    observations later at the hospital.  There is no suggestion that the words or the gestures conveyed any kind
    of confidential information.  Constable
    Randall did not question the appellant in the ambulance or attempt in any other
    way to obtain incriminatory evidence from the appellant; she was merely making
    observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the place where the information was obtained, the
    appellant had no property interest in the ambulance and no control over who
    rode in it.  The trial judge found that
    the people who did have control over the ambulance, the ambulance personnel,
    impliedly consented to Constable Randall being present.  Constable Randall’s presence did not in any
    way interfere with the appellant’s medical care.  The appellant did not testify that he was
    inhibited by Constable Randall’s presence in the ambulance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the offence under investigation was a most
    serious one.  The acts of Constable
    Randall in passively observing the appellant in the ambulance were wholly
    proportionate to the seriousness of the situation.  </p>

    trial judge correctly concluded that the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the
    Charter were not violated.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that hospital personnel took
    blood samples only for medical reasons.  There is absolutely no evidence that the physician who ordered that the
    blood samples be taken or that the nurse who took them were acting as agents of
    the state or that they took the samples with the intention of sharing the blood
    or the results of any analysis with the police.  Accordingly, s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> was not engaged.  See <i>R. v. Dersch</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (S.C.C.) at 12-3.</p>

    Scherer in placing seals on the vials of blood that had originally been taken
    for medical purposes constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of s. 8
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant points out that the evidence
    shows that but for Detective Constable Scherer’s intervention, the blood
    samples would undoubtedly have been destroyed before the police could have
    lawfully obtained the evidence through a search warrant.  This court has determined this issue against
    the position taken by the appellant on several occasions, most recently in <i>R. v. Gettins</i> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d)
    304 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ).  In <i>Gettins</i>,
    this court held that sealing vials of blood until a search warrant could be
    obtained, where, as here, the vials remained under the control of the hospital
    in the event they were needed for medical purposes, was not an unreasonable
    seizure.</p>

    direction that resulted in his physical or psychological detention.  The appellant was “detained” by his injuries
    from the collision.</p>

    intentionally delayed arresting him and making the breath demand.  He argues that Randall had already formulated
    the grounds for making the breath demand before the blood samples were
    taken.  Had she acted expeditiously, the
    appellant would have spoken to counsel and learned that he could withhold his
    consent to the taking of the blood samples.  The question of when Constable Randall formed her grounds for arrest and
    making the breath demand was a factual issue.  The trial judge resolved that issue against the appellant.  The trial judge extensively reviewed the
    evidence and concluded that the demand was made as soon as practicable.  I see no basis for interfering with this
    conclusion.  The appellant has not
    pointed to any misapprehension of fact by the trial judge or any failure to
    advert to relevant evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

    counsel is violated because the detainee has not received competent advice from
    duty counsel appears to be one of first impression in this court.  The trial judge applied the test formulated
    in <i>R. v. B. (G.D.)</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C.
    (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) where an appellant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel
    at trial.  <i>B. (G.D.)</i> involves a two-part test.  The appellant must show not only ineffective assistance but that this
    ineffective assistance resulted in significant prejudice to the fair
    trial.  The trial judge concluded that
    the appellant received competent advice concerning the breath demand, but did
    not receive competent advice concerning blood samples.  However, he went on to hold that the
    appellant was not prejudiced because by the time he had finished speaking to
    duty counsel, the police had already sealed the vials, and the appellant led no
    evidence that he could have required the hospital to destroy the vials of blood
    even if counsel had advised him to ask that this be done.</p>

    wrong test and that there was no requirement that he prove prejudice.  For the purposes of dealing with this ground
    of appeal, I will assume that where duty counsel provides incompetent advice, a
    detainee’s s. 10(b) rights are infringed.  However, I should not be taken as having decided that issue.  The issue is a complex one and would require
    an analysis of the relationship between the duty counsel programme and the

    of general deterrence would not be satisfied by a conditional sentence.  This determination was not unreasonable.  This was not a momentary lapse in judgment.  The evidence showed that the appellant
    consumed alcohol over a considerable period of time.  Because of the delay in obtaining the breath
