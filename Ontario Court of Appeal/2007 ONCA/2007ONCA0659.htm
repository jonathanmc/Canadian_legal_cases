    coverage under the Standard Automobile Policy.  The plaintiff, Ms. McArdle was a passenger in a vehicle (the Bugler
    vehicle) that collided with another vehicle (the Emmons vehicle) in September
    1999.  Bugler was not insured.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  As a result, the plaintiff sought coverage
    under the Emmons insurance policy.  The
    appellant Bugler submits that based on this court’s decision in <i>Taggart (Litigation Guardian of) v. Simmons</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 704, Ms. McArdle is entitled to uninsured motorist
    coverage contained in the Emmons policy.  Coseco Insurance Company insures the Emmons vehicle.  It argued before the motion judge that <i>Taggart</i> was distinguishable because the standard
    automobile insurance policy considered in <i>Taggart </i>was different than the policy at issue in this case.  In the alternative, Coseco argued that,
    properly understood, <i>Taggart</i> did not
    intend to expand eligibility of uninsured motorist coverage beyond the limited
    group of persons traditionally entitled to such coverage – the insured, the
    insured’s spouse and dependants and occupants of the insured vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accepted the first argument.  He then went on to consider whether Ms. McArdle
    was entitled to uninsured motor vehicle coverage under the Coseco policy.  He accepted Coseco’s argument that she was
    not entitled to coverage and dismissed the claim against Coseco.  It is common ground that the trial judge
    erred in distinguishing <i>Taggart</i> on
    the basis that the policy had changed.  Due to an innocent mistake, the motion judge was led to believe that the
    policy involved in this case and the policy considered in <i>Taggart</i> were different.  In
    fact, the relevant provisions are the same.  Coseco, however, seeks to uphold the motion judge’s decision by arguing
    that <i>Taggart</i> should not be extended
    to this case or, in the alternative, that <i>Taggart</i> was wrongly decided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would allow the
    appeal.  In my view, the holding in <i>Taggart</i> applies to this case and it
    should not be overruled.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Entitlement to uninsured motorist coverage is governed
    by statute, regulation and the terms of the applicable motor vehicle policy.  Section 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 requires that every motor
    vehicle insurance contract provide uninsured motorist coverage.  As a result, an individual entitled to
    coverage is entitled to recover from the insured all sums that could have been
    recovered from the owner or driver of the uninsured vehicle.  The issue in this case is who is entitled to
    coverage.  Under s. 265, the contract
    must provide coverage to “a person insured under the contract”.  “Person insured under the contract” is
    defined in s. 265, in part, as “the insured and his or her spouse and any
    dependant relative of either, … while an occupant of an uninsured
    automobile”.  Coseco submits that since
    the plaintiff does not fall within this definition – because she was not the
    insured (Emmons) or the spouse or dependent of the insured – she is not covered
    by the Emmons policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, however, relies upon the extended
    definition of “insured” in s. 224 of the Act.  That section defines “insured” for Part VI (Automobile Insurance) to
    mean “a person insured by a contract whether named or not <i>and includes every person who is entitled to statutory accident
    benefits</i> under the contract whether or not described therein as an insured
    person” [emphasis added].  To discover if
    someone is entitled to statutory accident benefits, it is necessary to look to
    the definition of “insured person” in O. Reg. 403/96, the Statutory Accident
    Benefits Schedule for accidents on or after November 1, 1996.  This definition includes “in respect of
    accidents in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    a person who is involved in an accident involving the insured automobile”.  Since the Emmons vehicle was an insured
    automobile, it is common ground that the plaintiff is entitled to statutory
    accident benefits from Coseco under the Emmons policy (and in fact Coseco has
    been paying those benefits).  The
    plaintiff therefore fits within the s. 224 definition of “insured”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue, then, is whether the broader definition of
    “insured” in s. 224 informs the narrower s. 265 definition of “person insured
    under the contract”, thereby entitling the plaintiff to uninsured motorist
    coverage.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The<i> Taggart </i>Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Taggart</i> decision concerned a single vehicle collision in September 1995 in which Mr.
    Taggart suffered a catastrophic injury.  Mr.
    Taggart was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a person who had no insurance
    and which was owned by a person who had no insurance.  At the time, Mr. Taggart was living with a
    Mr. Tessier.  The relationship between
    Mr. Taggart, Mr. Tessier and Mr. Taggart’s parents was somewhat complex.  Suffice it to say that Mr. Tessier had for
    many years acted as a surrogate father for Mr. Taggart.  Mr. Tessier had an automobile insurance
    policy with Pilot Insurance and Mr. Taggart accordingly sought coverage under
    that policy.  Writing for the court,
    Goudge J.A. considered the matter as essentially one turning on the statutory
    and regulatory provisions.  Regulation
    776/93, the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule for accidents after December
    31, 1993 and before November 1, 1996 (the precursor to O. Reg. 403/96), defined
    “insured person” to include “any dependent of the named insured” (O. Reg. 776/93).  Goudge J.A. held that it would be open to a
    court to find that Mr.&nbsp;Taggart was a dependent of the named insured Mr.
    Tessier.  If found to be a dependent, Mr.
    Taggart would be entitled to statutory accident benefits, bringing him within
    the definition of “insured” in s. 224.  Goudge J.A. held that to be sufficient to qualify Mr. Taggart as a
    “person insured under the contract” in s. 265, even though that section’s
    definition would, on its face, disqualify a dependant who was not also a
    “relative”.  He relied on basic
    principles of statutory interpretation to reach this conclusion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Section 265(1) mandates uninsured automobile
    coverage for “a person insured under the contract”. The definition in s.
    265(2)(c)(ii) of a “person insured under the contract” includes the “insured”.
    While “insured” is not further defined in s. 265, it is defined in s. 224(1),
    which explicitly defines the term for the purposes of Part VI of the Act. That
    part governs automobile insurance and includes s. 265. There is nothing in s.
    265 to negate the clear legislative intention that the definition of “insured”
    in s. 224(1) applies to s. 265(2)(c) (ii). The phrase at the beginning of s.
    265(2) “for the purposes of this section” cannot be read as “for the purposes
    of this section and without regard to s. 224(1).”</span>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that <i>Taggart</i> offers a clear answer to the central question in this case:
    the expanded definition of “insured” in s. 224 informs the narrower definition
    of “person insured under the contract” in s. 265.  If a plaintiff is entitled to statutory
    accident benefits, then he or she is also entitled to uninsured motorist
    coverage.  Thus, through a
    straightforward application of <i>Taggart</i>,
    Ms. McArdle being entitled to statutory accident benefits under the Emmons
    policy is similarly entitled to the additional uninsured motor vehicle coverage
    under the Emmons policy.  In an
    interesting argument, Mr. Charney, counsel for Coseco, resists that conclusion.
    I will now turn to those submissions.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Argument against Applying<i> Taggart</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument against applying <i>Taggart</i> to the facts of this case turns on the theory that
    uninsured motor vehicle coverage and statutory accident benefit entitlement
    have proceeded on different tracks.  While
    statutory accident benefit coverage has been broad, uninsured coverage has been
    relatively narrow and has depended on the wording of the policy and regulation
    more than the statute.  Mr. Charney
    points out that <i>Taggart</i> involved a
    dependent of the named insured, someone within the traditional scope of UIM
    coverage. This care, however, goes well beyond that to attempt to extend
    coverage to a stranger to the named insured. In this part of the reasons, I
    will briefly sketch out the basis for the argument to limit the scope of <i>Taggart</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There have been some changes in terminology in respect
    of statutory accident benefits.  For the
    sake of clarity, I will refer to statutory accident benefits as SABs and
    uninsured motor vehicle coverage as UIM.  SABs were first introduced into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario automobile insurance scheme in
    1971.  At that time, there was no
    statutory provision mandating UIM.  With
    the introduction of SABs, the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 224 was amended to broaden the definition of
    “insured”: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>“insured” means a person insured by a contract
    whether named or not and includes any person who is stated in a contract to be
    entitled to benefits payable under the insurance mentioned in subsection 1 of
    section 226b [medical and rehabilitation benefits] and subsection 1 of section
    226c [accident benefits], whether described therein as an insured person or
    not. <i>Insurance Amendment Act, 1971</i>,
    S.O. 1971, c. 84, s. 10(b).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1980, the Act for the first time mandated UIM
    coverage.  Regulation 535 was to be
    attached to or included in every motor vehicle liability policy as a Schedule
    to the policy (R.R.O. 1980, Reg. 535).  It applied to payments under s. 231(1) of the 1980 Act, which mandated
    UIM coverage.  Coseco particularly relies
    upon s. 10 of the regulation, which has remained materially unchanged since 1980
    (and is now s. 10 of R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676) and provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>10.       In so far as applicable the general
    provisions, definitions, exclusions and statutory conditions <i>as contained in a motor vehicle policy</i> also apply to payments under the contract under subsection 231(1) of the Act.

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coseco argues that this provision gives primacy to the
    policy and that in order to understand who is eligible for UIM coverage it is
    necessary to look to the wording of the policy.  The policy in force in 1980 was the Ontario Standard Automobile Policy
    S.P.F. 1.  The UIM coverage was found in clause
    3 of Part B of the Policy and required the insurer to pay all sums that “a
    person insured under the contract” was “legally entitled to recover from the
    owner or driver of an uninsured automobile”. “Person insured under the contract” insofar as is relevant to this case
    is defined to mean any person while an occupant of the insured automobile or:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>the insured and,
    if residing in the same dwelling premises as the insured, his or her spouse and
    any dependent relative of either,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    uninsured … automobile….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If this definition fully defined eligibility for UIM
    coverage then a person in the place of Ms. McArdle would not have been
    covered.  Coseco argues that in view of
    s. 10 of the Regulation, this definition is exhaustive as to coverage for UIM
    and that the legislature did not intend to expand coverage by resort to the
    definition of “insured” in [now] s. 224 of the Act, which had been broadened to
    account for SABs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 10 of the regulations has been carried forward
    in all subsequent iterations.  There is
    no reference in <i>Taggart</i> to the UIM regulations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next legislative development comes with the
    replacement of Reg. 535 with R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676 which adds s. 11 and
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this
    Schedule, “person insured under the contract’, “unidentified automobile” and
    “uninsured automobile” have the same meaning as in subsection 265(2) of the

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coseco argues that this section reinforces the view
    that there was no intention to provide broad coverage as would be the case if
    the s. 224 definition applied.  It points
    to the consistency between the definition in the policy and the definition in s.
    265 as manifesting a legislative intent to limit UIM coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 1990, the O.P.F. 1 policy came into force.  Part D of the policy dealt with UIM coverage
    and defined “person insured under the policy” in a similar fashion to the S.P.F.
    1 policy except that it removed the qualification that the spouse or dependent
    relative be residing with the insured.  The motion judge was innocently misled into believing that this was the
    policy in force at the time of <i>Taggart</i>.  On that basis he distinguished <i>Taggart</i> from this case and held that the
    result in <i>Taggart</i> did not apply.</p>

    time of the accident considered in <i>Taggart</i> and ushered in the era of the plain language policy:  <i>David
    Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at para. 26.  The policy, for example,
    uses terms like “you” and “us” rather than “the insured” and “the insurer”, but
    does contain reference to terms such as the “named insured”, being the person
    to whom the Certificate of Automobile Insurance is issued.  Section 4 of the policy entitled “Accident
    Benefits Coverage” deals with SABs.  The
    broad definition of “Who Is Covered” in s. 4.1 includes Ms. McArdle as a person
    “who is injured … in an automobile accident involving the automobile and is not
    the named insured, or the spouse or dependant of a named insured, under any
    other motor vehicle liability policy, and is not covered under the policy of an
    automobile in which they were an occupant or which struck them”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of the policy is entitled “Uninsured
    Automobile Coverage”.  The description of
    “Who is Covered?” in s. 5.3 is narrower than under s. 4 and is limited to any
    occupant of the automobile and “You, your spouse and any dependant relative of
    either, when an occupant of an uninsured automobile”.  As worded, the policy would not extend to Ms.
    McArdle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes the point that there would be no
    need to refer to anyone other than the insured and his or her family since the
    policy is describing coverage in plain language for the insured; the fact that
    the Act or Regulations might extend coverage to strangers is of no moment to
    the insured.  While there is some merit
    to this submission, I note that Section 4, which deals with SABs, contains a
    definition of who is covered that includes individuals who would be strangers
    to the named insured.</p>

    place at the time of the accident in this case.  There is no material difference between this version of the policy and
    the policy considered in <i>Taggart</i> regarding
    UIM coverage.  As I have indicated, Coseco
    concedes that the motion judge was inadvertently misled into believing that the
    policies were different, since he erroneously believed that the policy in place
    at the time of <i>Taggart</i> was the O.P.F.
    1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coseco has also referred us to legislation in force in
    other provinces.  This legislation
    defines “person insured under the contract” for the purposes of UIM in terms
    that are similar to s. 265(2) of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    act.  In <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd.</i> at para. 137, this court pointed out
    the desirability of consistency among provincial appellate courts in
    interpreting essentially identical provisions of statutory automobile insurance
    regimes.  Coseco makes the submission
    that in all of the other common law provinces, the various insurance statutes
    restrict UIM coverage to the named insured, his or her spouse and dependent
    relatives.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, Coseco concedes that it was not open to
    the motion judge to distinguish <i>Taggart</i> on the basis that the provisions of the policies were different.  It argues, however, that <i>Taggart</i> should be restricted to its facts, namely dealing with whether
    a dependent of a named insured was entitled to UIM coverage.  I cannot accept this submission.  There were two issues in <i>Taggart</i>.  First, whether Mr.
    Taggart was entitled to UIM coverage under s. 265 and second, whether he was
    entitled to coverage under the Family Protection Coverage endorsement in the
    Tessier policy.  Justice Goudge dealt
    with the first issue by referring to the definition of insured in s. 224.  He held that if Mr. Taggart could show he was
    a dependant of Mr. Tessier, he was entitled to UIM coverage for the reasons set
    out above.  As I have said, eligibility
    for SABs did not depend upon Mr. Taggart showing he was a relative of Mr.
    Tessier, only that he was a dependent.  Paragraph
    20 of the <i>Taggart</i> reasons makes this
    clear:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The s. 224(1) definition of “insured” includes
    every person who is entitled to statutory accident benefits under the policy.
    If John Taggart was a dependant of the named insured Mr. Tessier (an issue which
    would be litigated at trial), then he was clearly entitled to statutory
    accident benefits under the Pilot policy pursuant to s. 1 of Reg. 776/93 of the
    Act. On this basis, John Taggart would be an “insured” and therefore, a “person
    insured under the contract” for the purposes of s. 265. He would therefore be
    entitled to uninsured coverage under the Pilot policy if he can prove
    dependency.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only when Goudge J.A. came to deal with Mr. Taggart’s
    eligibility for coverage under the Family Protection Coverage endorsement, did
    he deal with the question of whether Mr.&nbsp;Taggart was a relative of Mr.
    Tessier.  This is because the definition
    of “insured” in s. 224 does not apply to the endorsement. Rather, coverage depended
    entirely on the wording of the endorsement, which limited coverage to <i>inter alia</i> a “dependent relative”, which
    itself is defined in the endorsement.  For reasons that are not material to this case, Goudge J.A. held that
    Mr. Taggart was a relative of Mr. Tessier if he could demonstrate the requisite
    degree of dependency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, a step to finding that Mr. Taggart was
    entitled to UIM coverage was that he could fall within the definition of “insured”
    in s. 224 as a person entitled to SABs.  The application of that part of <i>Taggart</i> cannot be limited as suggested by Coseco to the narrower issue of the meaning
    of “relative” in s. 265.  Accordingly, it
    seems to me that for Coseco to succeed in this appeal, it must show that <i>Taggart</i> should be overruled.</p>

    seeks to have this court overrule one of its decisions, it should apply to the

    the lateness of the request, we declined to adjourn the case so that Coseco
    could apply to the Chief Justice.  </p>

    apply.  Laskin J.A. explained the <i>per incuriam</i> exception to <i>stare decisis</i> in <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd.</i> at para. 111.  In short, it must be shown that the panel
    deciding the earlier case did not advert to judicial or statutory authority
    binding on it and, had the panel considered this authority, it would have
    decided the case differently.  In my
    view, neither condition is satisfied in this case.  There is no binding<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    refer to the SABs regulation; evidently, it was not oblivious to the <i>Insurance Act</i> regulations.  In any event, I doubt whether it would have
    decided the case differently.  Section 11
    of the schedule provides that “person insured under the contract” has the same
    meaning as in s. 265(2) of the Act.  The
    meaning of the term in s. 265(2) was the very issue dealt with in <i>Taggart</i> and, as described above, Goudge
    J.A. makes it clear that “insured” in s. 265 must be interpreted having regard
    to s. 224.</p>

    because the earlier case might have been argued differently or better.  It also does not apply because the court
    sitting on the later case would have reached a different conclusion.  None of the other reasons for not applying <i>stare decisis</i> as discussed in <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd.</i> apply.</p>
