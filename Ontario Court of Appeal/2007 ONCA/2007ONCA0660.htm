line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, Peter Misko, was involved in two motor
    vehicle accidents that occurred eleven months apart.  He settled with the first tortfeasor, Michael
    De Bruin, and gave him a standard release.  The identity of the second tortfeasor is unknown.  Accordingly, the plaintiff sued, among other
    people, the insurer of his own vehicle, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, since
    the policy on that vehicle includes unidentified motorist insurance.  Liberty Mutual brought a third party claim against
    the first tortfeasor, De Bruin.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this case is whether Liberty Mutual was
    entitled to bring that third party claim.  Justice Desotti struck out the third party claim.  Liberty Mutual appeals from that order.  For the following reasons, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 31, 2001, the plaintiff, Misko, was involved
    in the first motor vehicle accident with De Bruin.  Eleven months later, on December 20, 2001,
    Misko was involved in the second motor vehicle accident.  The other driver in this accident has not been
    identified.  Several months later, before
    any statement of claim was issued, Misko settled with De Bruin for $130,000.  He gave De Bruin a release that contained the
    standard term that he would not make any claim or take proceedings against any
    person who might claim contribution or indemnity from De Bruin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just short of two years after the second accident, on
    December 15, 2003, Misko commenced an action against several persons including
    Liberty Mutual, the insurer of his own vehicle.  He claimed payment under the unidentified motorist provisions of his
    policy.  Paragraph 10 of Liberty Mutual’s
    statement of defence pleads that Misko’s injuries existed prior to the second
    accident or, in the alternative, were sustained after the second accident.  Liberty Mutual did not give any particulars
    in support of this allegation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During discoveries in 2004, Liberty Mutual learned of
    the earlier accident and the settlement.  It then brought a motion for leave to issue a third party claim against
    De Bruin.  De Bruin was not given notice
    of the motion.  Justice Heeney granted
    the motion.  A fair reading of his endorsement
    indicates that Heeney J. doubted whether the third party claim should proceed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>(6) Where two accidents happen one after the
    other, it is customary to have both actions tried together, or one after the
    other, in order that a global assessment of the plaintiff’s damages can be
    arrived at, and be apportioned between the tortfeasors as the court deems
    appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>(7) However, <i>when
    all claims arising out of the first accident have been settled, it is not necessary
    to assess the plaintiff’s damages arising out of that accident</i>. Those
    claims have been disposed of, and whether the settlement was too high or too
    low or just right should make no difference. All that should count is the
    physical condition of the plaintiff at the time of the second accident, which
    can be determined on the evidence without the need for a Third Party Claim. <i>If he was already significantly injured by
    the first accident, then
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty
    Mutual should only be held liable for any aggravation to those injuries or any
    additional injuries caused by the second accident</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Heeney J. decided to follow the decision of <i>Medeiros v. Dilworth</i> (2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 136 (S.C.J.), where the court allowed a third party claim to issue in
    circumstances not unlike this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>De Bruin then brought the motion before Desotti J. to
    strike the third party claim.  For the
    purpose of this appeal, the important parts of the third party claim are found
    in paragraphs 11 and 12:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>11.       The
    Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of his accident of December 20, 2001, he
    has suffered from, among other things, injuries to the same parts of his body
    as were injured in the January 31, 2001 accident (i.e. his neck and back).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>12.       The
    Defendant states that the Plaintiff’s damages have been caused exclusively by
    the negligence of the Third Party.  Alternatively, the Defendant states that the Plaintiff’s damages have
    been contributed to significantly by the negligence of the Third Party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without objection, an affidavit of a law clerk
    with Misko’s solicitors was placed before the motion judge.  In the affidavit, the solicitors state that
    the Liberty Mutual action is for damages arising exclusively from the second
    collision and that no damages are being claimed for injuries sustained in the
    first (De Bruin) accident.  Counsel for
    Misko confirmed this fact before the motion judge, in their factum in this
    court, and in oral argument in this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In careful and comprehensive reasons, the motion
    judge reviewed many of the leading, and conflicting, authorities including <i>Medeiros</i>. He concluded that distinct and <span lang=EN>separate injuries are to be assessed
    based on each defendant's liability for the injury they have caused as a result
    of their respective wrongs. Further, if defendants are not concurrent
    tortfeasors (existing or happening at the same time) then they cannot third
    party one another. Since the defendant and the third party were not concurrent
    tortfeasors in this case, the third party claim must be struck out. I agree
    with the motion judge’s conclusion, although for somewhat different reasons.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The position of the appellant, Liberty Mutual, is based
    primarily on the <i>Negligence Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1.  Section 1 of that Act
    provides that where damages </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>have been caused or contributed to by the fault or
    neglect of two or more persons, the court shall determine the degree in which
    each of such persons is at fault or negligent, and, where two or more persons
    are found at fault or negligent, they are jointly and severally liable to the
    person suffering loss or damage for such fault or negligence, <i>but as between themselves, in the absence of
    any contract express or implied, each is liable to make contribution and
    indemnify each other in the degree in which they are respectively found to be
    at fault or negligent.</i> [Emphasis added.]  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Liberty Mutual submits that the plaintiff’s damages were caused
    or contributed to by De Bruin.  Accordingly, it may be able to seek indemnity from De Bruin, hence the
    need for the third party claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third party, De Bruin, submits that this case can
    be resolved by using principles of law respecting assessment of damages long
    applied where there are successive accidents.  In effect, the court makes a global assessment for both accidents.  The court assesses the damages following the first
    accident as if the trial were held on the day before the second accident, which
    will then be deducted from the global award leaving the balance owing for the
    second defendant.  Since Liberty Mutual
    would thus be responsible only for the damages flowing from the second accident,
    it would not be entitled to contribution from De Bruin.  Accordingly, De Bruin contends that the third
    party claim was properly struck. Alternatively, if the appeal is allowed, he
    relies on the release from the plaintiff to argue that the third party action
    should be permanently stayed or, if the third party action proceeds, the main
    action must be dismissed or stayed in accordance with the release.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  To do otherwise, he submits, would
    breach the release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff agrees that the third party action was
    properly struck out.  His principal
    concern is that if the third party action is permitted to proceed, his action
    against Liberty Mutual is in jeopardy because of the release he gave to De
    Bruin. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases in this area are not entirely consistent and,
    among other things, engage issues of causation and contribution and indemnity
    amongst tortfeasors.  Further, lurking
    behind the issues in this case is a formidable policy question.  In giving the release, the plaintiff agreed
    that he would not make any claim or take proceedings against any person who
    might claim contribution or indemnity from De Bruin.  If Liberty Mutual is allowed to bring a third
    party claim against De Bruin, the plaintiff will be in breach of that
    agreement.  Thus, if Liberty Mutual is
    successful in adding De Bruin as a third party, then it would seem to follow
    that the plaintiff’s claim against Liberty Mutual should be struck out in view
    of the release given to De Bruin.  See <i>Sinclair-Cockburn Insurance Brokers Ltd. v.
    Richards</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 105 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Such a result would seriously undermine the
    public interest in settling actions.  Few
    plaintiffs would risk providing a release in the standard form used in this
    case fearing that if injured in a separate incident, months or even years
    later, the plaintiff would have no recourse against the second tortfeasor.  Defendants may be reluctant to settle if they
    continue to be exposed to liability from claims brought by subsequent
    tortfeasors.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Full Compensation Principle</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the governing decision in the circumstances
    of this case is <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>,
    [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458 and in particular this statement by Major J. at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Apportionment between tortious causes is expressly
    permitted by provincial negligence statutes and is consistent with the general
    principles of tort law. The plaintiff is still fully compensated and is placed
    in the position he or she would have been in but for the negligence of the
    defendants. Each defendant remains fully liable to the plaintiff for the
    injury, since each was a cause of the injury. <i>The legislation simply permits defendants to seek contribution and
    indemnity from one another, according to the degree of responsibility for the
    injury</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with this statement, Liberty Mutual
    submits that it is entitled to seek contribution and indemnity from De Bruin.  I agree with Liberty Mutual to this
    extent.  If, because of the full
    compensation principle set out in <i>Athey</i>,
    Liberty Mutual could be liable for damages caused by De Bruin, then it is
    entitled to issue the third party action.  It need not wait until the conclusion of the trial and then launch
    another action against De Bruin.  See <i>Medeiros</i> at para. 14.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, however, I am
    satisfied that at the trial, Liberty Mutual will not be at risk of having to
    compensate the plaintiff for damages from the first accident.  The trial between the plaintiff and Liberty
    Mutual will proceed in accordance with the principles established by this court
    and generally followed in other jurisdictions where the plaintiff has been
    injured by successive motor vehicle accidents.  Liberty Mutual will have no occasion to seek contribution or indemnity
    from De Bruin because, if it should be found to be liable to the plaintiff,
    judgment will go against it only for its degree of responsibility for the plaintiff’s
    injuries.  Since it can have no claim
    against De Bruin, it is not entitled to commence a third party claim either
    under Rule 29.01<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    be liable to Liberty Mutual and, in the words of s. 5 of the Act, De Bruin is
    not responsible for the damages claimed by the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of this appeal, there was much
    discussion about whether at this stage it was possible to determine whether the
    injuries to the plaintiff were divisible or indivisible and whether the
    tortfeasors could be described as concurrent tortfeasors or fell into some
    other category.  In my view, these terms
    simply obscure the issues that will be determined at the trial in accordance
    with the Act and governing principles.  Assuming that, as alleged by Liberty Mutual, there is a single
    indivisible injury, this simply means that, applying <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>, both tortfeasors are fully liable for the injury.  The court, however, must still apportion
    responsibility between the tortfeasors.  Liberty
    Mutual will be responsible in the pending trial only to the extent that the
    unidentified driver caused or contributed<a

line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> changed the common law and allows for contribution and indemnity among
    tortfeasors.  See David Cheifetz, <i>Apportionment of Fault in Tort</i> (Aurora: Canada
    Law Book Ltd., 1981) at 8-9.  However, s.
    1 of the Act provides a mechanism to allocate responsibility for the
    plaintiff’s damages: the court “<i>shall</i> determine the degree in which each of such persons are found at fault or
    negligent” [emphasis added].  Such
    allocation of responsibility is necessary since it is the foundation for
    determining the amount of contribution or indemnity.  Applying s. 1 to the circumstances of this
    case, at the trial between Misko and Liberty Mutual, the court will determine both
    the amount of damages suffered by Misko and the degree of responsibility
    attributable to the second accident.  In
    view of the plaintiff’s position that this is all he seeks from Liberty Mutual (and
    that he does not rely on the full compensation principle in <i>Athey</i>), judgment will go against Liberty
    Mutual only for the damages for which the second tortfeasor is
    responsible.  If the damages are
    “indivisible” as is alleged by Liberty Mutual, this task may not be an easy
    one, but the court will have to make the determination.  See <i>Blackwater
    v. Plint</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 3 at para.&nbsp;82; <i>O’Neil v. Van Horne</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 384 (

    protect Liberty Mutual from having to pay compensation to Misko for damages
    that should be the responsibility of De Bruin.  I will turn to those cases below.  I first wish to deal with the one case that seems to be inconsistent
    with this position, namely <i>Martin v.
    Listowel Memorial Hospital</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 384 (C.A.) where this court
    held in <i>obiter</i> at para. 48 that s. 1 of
    the <i>Act</i> only applies to parties to
    the action:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In our view, the effect of s. 1 of the Act is to
    define the legal effect of a finding of fault by concurrent wrongdoers. The
    effect is to change the common law, and impose on concurrent wrongdoers joint
    and several liability to the plaintiff. It is the only section of the Act which
    imposes liability, as opposed to apportioning fault. The section is
    substantive, not procedural. Therefore, when applying the section to any
    specific action, it is understood that joint and several liability to the
    plaintiff can and will attach only to a party defendant, although others who
    may also have been at fault could potentially have been found jointly and
    severally liable had they been sued by the plaintiff. <i>Because procedurally the section only affects defendants, under this
    section the court is to apportion degrees of fault only to defendants. The
    court must also apportion fault to the other parties, the plaintiff and third
    parties, not under s. 1 of the Act but rather pursuant to ss. 3 and 4 of the
    Act, and in accordance with the requirements of the pleadings</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>

    Liberty Mutual could argue that it must join De Bruin to the action so that
    fault can be apportioned between the two of them.  This court considered <i>Martin </i>at length in <i>M. (J.) v.
    Bradley</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 171 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) in the context of complex
    litigation involving a Pierringer settlement.  I do not need to review <i>Bradley</i> at length.  Suffice it to say that Cronk
    J.A. speaking for the court held that <i>Martin</i> could be distinguished for a number of reasons.  In particular, she highlighted at para. 47 that in <i>Martin</i> itself, there was apportionment to non-parties, namely the
    physicians who had been sued but had settled prior to trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court explained in <i>Martin</i>, the reason for ordinarily applying s. 1 only to parties is
    to protect the other defendants.  In a
    case where there are two or more party defendants but a degree of fault could
    be attributed to a non-party then a party defendant who, being jointly and
    severally liable to the plaintiff, paid the entire award would not be able to
    obtain a fair share of contribution from the other party defendants.  The court described this problem at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The effect of a finding of a degree of fault on a
    non-party could have significant consequences for the other defendants under
    this section. If the fault is apportioned only among the parties, then if there
    is a non-party who may also have been at fault and contributed to the damage, a
    larger percentage of the whole loss may be attributed to each party, so that
    the entire loss is divided for indemnity purposes, and no gap is left. But <i>if a portion of the fault were attributed to
    a non-party</i>, or to a party at fault but with a legal defence such as a
    limitation defence, <i>the defendants who
    are liable to the plaintiff would be left with no one from whom they could
    recover that portion of the claim</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Bradley</i>,
    Cronk J.A. pointed out at para. 53 that this was a “critical” reason to
    distinguish <i>Martin</i> in that case.  For similar reasons, <i>Martin</i> does not apply here.  It would be counterintuitive to refuse to apply s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> when by applying it the
    defendant would be protected because it would be held liable only for the
    degree of damages for which it is at fault.  As in <i>Bradley</i>, see para. 64,
    no one objects, or could legitimately object, to the apportionment of liability
    at trial as against De Bruin.  De&nbsp;Bruin
    has no objection since he is protected by the release.  The plaintiff has no objection since he claims
    from Liberty Mutual only the portion of his damages attributable to the fault
    or negligence of the second driver.  Liberty Mutual can have no objection since it will be responsible only
    for the damages attributable to the second driver.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court held in <i>Blackwater </i>at para. 80, where there are two wrongful acts that have
    affected the plaintiff, each “defendant must compensate for the damages it
    actually caused but need not compensate for the debilitating effects of the
    other wrongful act that would have occurred anyway.  This means that the damages of the tortfeasor
    may be reduced by reason of other contributing causes”.  Section 1 provides the mechanism for vindicating
    this basic principle of fairness despite statutory joint and several liability
    and the <i>Athey </i>rule mandating full
    compensation to the plaintiff.</p>

    support the position of the third party that the third party action should be
    struck out.  I start with the cases that
    describe the manner in which damages will be assessed.  In <i>Hicks
    v. Cooper </i>(1973), 1 O.R. (2d) 221 (C.A.) the plaintiff had been involved in
    two separate motor vehicle accidents approximately six months apart and
    suffered injuries to some of the same parts of her body in both accidents.  The court approved of the manner in which the
    trial judge had apportioned damages between two defendants at pp. 221-222:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In coming to this result the trial Judge, who
    incidentally, is a very experienced and able Judge, followed the formula laid
    down by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Long v. Thiessen and Laliberte</i> (1968), 65 W.W.R. 577. In other
    words, he assessed damages against the defendant in the first accident as if
    the trial were held on the day before the second accident occurred. He then
    assessed what are called the global damages, that is the damages sustained as a
    result of both actions, and this came to $7,000. Having assessed the damages
    resulting from the first action at $3,000 he therefore awarded the plaintiff
    $4,000 against the Petrofina company and Wayne Smith.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    and thus determine the damages for which Liberty Mutual is responsible.  I point out that there has been some
    criticism of the <i>Hicks v. Cooper</i> approach because it may be too difficult to apply in certain cases or unfair to
    the plaintiff.  In such cases, the courts
    have apportioned damages on a percentage basis.  See e.g. <i>Bourque v. Wells</i> (1991), 82 D.L.R. (4th) 574 (N.B.C.A.); <i>Pryor
    v. Bains</i> (1986), 69 B.C.L.R. 395 (

    affirmed (1997), 147 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 166 (C.A.).  I make no comment on whether the <i>Bourque v. Wells</i> procedure is open in
    this province in light of <i>Hicks v. Cooper</i>.  The issue was not argued before us.  Either way, Liberty Mutual will be
    responsible only for the portion of damages attributable to the second driver.  </p>

    sought leave to issue a third party claim against the first defendant.  The Master refused to grant leave, but
    Chapnik J. overturned that decision.  The
    part of her reasons that applies to this case is found in para. 14:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>First, this is a matter that is vital to the final
    disposition of the action. The defendant is not relieved of responsibility if
    his tortious act materially contributed to the overall condition of the
    plaintiff. Where, however, the plaintiff’s injuries are attributable to
    multiple tortfeasors, defendants must seek contribution or indemnity from one
    another pursuant to the <i>Negligence Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1: <i>Alderson v.
    Callaghan</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 136, 1998 Carswell Ont 2189 (C.A.). The fact
    that the defendant can commence a separate action for this purpose does not
    diminish the importance of the issue.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chapnik J. relied upon this court’s decision in <i>Alderson</i>.  <i>Alderson</i>,
    however, involved a different issue.  In <i>Alderson</i>, the plaintiff was injured in a
    motor vehicle accident and then further injured by her spouse (who also
    happened, by coincidence, to be the defendant in the motor vehicle
    accident).  However, the only action
    before the court arose out of the motor vehicle accident.  In that context, relying upon the principles
    from <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>, the motor
    vehicle defendant was wholly responsible for the injuries to the plaintiff and
    could then seek indemnity against the non-defendant (notionally himself) for
    that part of the injuries for which the non-defendant was responsible.  That, however, is not this case.  The plaintiff in this case, Misko, does not
    seek redress from Liberty Mutual for any part of his injuries for which De
    Bruin is responsible.  It may be that <i>Medeiros </i>can be explained simply because
    there is nothing to indicate that the plaintiff would not seek redress from the
    second defendant for injuries for which the first defendant is
    responsible.  Similarly, see <i>Martin v. Rayner</i>, 2003 Carswell Ont.
