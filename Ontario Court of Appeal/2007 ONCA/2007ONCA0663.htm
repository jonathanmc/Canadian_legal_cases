  <h2>Factual Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. and Mrs. Higgins were married on August 7,
    1982.  There are four children of the
    marriage: Alyshia age twenty-one, Heather age nineteen, Kenny age seventeen and
    Paul age sixteen.  During their marriage,
    Mr. and Mrs. Higgins were involved in a paralegal business related principally
    to appearances in traffic court.  They
    separated in 2004 when Mrs. Higgins learned that her husband was involved in a
    relationship with Ms. Fisher.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Divorce proceedings, including claims for corollary
    relief and equalization of net family properties and other property claims,
    were commenced by Mrs. Higgins against her husband on January 14, 2005.  To say that these proceedings have been
    acrimonious would be a gross understatement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By consent order dated February 21, 2005, Mr.
    Higgins agreed to pay $1,054 per month in child support for all four
    children.  In June 2005, one of the two
    boys, Kenny, moved in with his father.  The other three children remained with Mrs. Higgins.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently, Mrs. Higgins obtained orders for
    additional child support for the three children remaining with her and for
    retroactive spousal support of $2,200 per month.  Mr. Higgins fell seriously into arrears of
    his support obligations.  Eventually, his
    pleadings were struck as a result of his ongoing default in payment.  Also, Mr. Higgins made an assignment into
    bankruptcy.</p>
  <h2>The Disclosure Order</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On July 25, 2006, Mrs. Higgins brought a motion
    before Perkins J. of the Superior Court of Justice for document production from
    both Mr. Higgins and Ms. Fisher.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge ordered Mr. Higgins to “provide
    by August 25, for the last fiscal year and for current fiscal year, all
    documents and information set out in Notice of Motion, paragraph 3”.  Paragraph 3 of the Notice of Motion requested
    the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>An Order requesting all
    the current financial records from Mr. Higgins, business and personal, and any
    account he has access [<i>sic</i>], in his
    name or as secondary.  Including
    photocopies of cheques, front and back.  His deposit books (without names blocked out), cash receipts, and court
    records, and court books.  Records of the
    income he makes from other paralegals that he subcontracts from as well as the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge ordered Ms. Fisher to “provide
    all documents and information set out in the Notice of Motion, paragraph 2
    deleting client names and contact information from any documents provided by
    August 25<sup>th</sup>”.  Paragraph 2 of
    the Notice of Motion requested the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>An order for Mrs. Fisher
    to provide <u>ALL</u> of her financial records from Jan. 2003 (prior to meeting
    Mr. Higgins Sept. 2003) to present date.  Including credit card applications, and all statements for accounts that
    she has access [<i>sic</i>], in her own
    name, or as a secondary card holder.  All
    bank accounts that she has access [<i>sic</i>]
    and/or signing authority on, business and personal.  <u>ALL</u> financial records of her various
    companies, “<u>We Fight Tickets Inc.</u>”, “<u>Traffic Court Defense Inc.</u>”
    (for which she was sued), “Dismiss Traffic Court Agents Inc.” (virtually
    identical to our company name of 16 years), “Sure-Win Legal Services” and
    “Ticketfixx” (a newly purchased business), any other companies she has access [<i>sic</i>] of any sort.  Loan/credit line application, bank
    statements, life insurance policies, or ones to which she is the beneficiary,

    accounts, statements deposit books, cash books, court books, business and
    personal.  Income receipts, in the form
    of cheques, Mastercard, Visa, cash, Amex.  A copy of the lease agreement on her house that she rents (and Mr.
    Higgins pays for) from her father’s numbered company and copies of the checks
    (front and back) that she pays the rent or cash receipts if paid in cash.  Details of who claims the rental income.  Anything being held in trust for her or her

  <h2>The Bankruptcy of Mr. Higgins</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As indicated above, Mr. Higgins made an
    assignment in bankruptcy.  In the
    bankruptcy proceedings, Mrs. Higgins opposed an application made by Mr. Higgins
    for his discharge from bankruptcy.  On
    April 26, 2006, the Registrar in Bankruptcy, while granting an adjournment of
    the application for a discharge, made an endorsement that provided in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Additionally, there
    appears to be an issue that the family law action, at Nmkt, is proceeding with
    respect of claims which are covered by the BIA Stay without a section 69.4 BIA
    order having been obtained.  This must
    stop.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Adjournment request
    granted, matter is returnable Nov 02/06 at 2:00 pm ½ day, preemptory [<i>sic</i>] on the opp cred.  It is a term of this adjournment that the opp
    cred abide by the stay and not proceed with any claims against the bankrupt in
    Family court or elsewhere which are covered by the stay without obtaining leave
    of the bankruptcy court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the application for discharge came on again
    before the Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy on November 2, 2006, he observed in
    his endorsement that Mrs. Higgins had brought a number of motions in violation
    of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> and the order of the Registrar referred to above, dated April 26, 2006.  He then ordered that Mrs. Higgins advise the
    Superior Court in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket
    of the endorsement of the Registrar dated April 26, 2006.  The Deputy Registrar included the following
    in his endorsement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While it is not for this
    court to direct the court dealing with the family law matters on how it should
    proceed, these two matters (the bankruptcy and the equalization portion of the
    family law matter) and the allegations raised in them seem to be so intertwined
    that a case conference seeking direction in the family law matter might give
    direction to this court as well as how to proceed.  I am therefore ordering the Opposing Creditor
    and the Bankrupt to request a case conference before the court dealing with
    their family law matter seeking directions with respect to the
    interrelationship between these proceedings and this, including the impact of
    the BIA stay on those proceedings.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Lastly I order both the
    Opposing Creditor and the Bankrupt to give notice to the trustee in bankruptcy
    of all proceedings in the family law matter, including the request for a case
    conference, so that the trustee may be present to represent the interest of the
    Bankrupt’s estate. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Bankrupt’s
    Application for discharge is adjourned <i>sine
    die</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Higgins raises Mrs. Higgins’ failure to
    advise Nelson J. of the Registrar’s order as a ground of appeal in respect of
    the support order.  Mrs. Higgins says that
    if she did not advise Nelson J. of the order of the Registrar in Bankruptcy
    dated April 26, 2006 when she obtained the order for additional child support, her
    failure was due to lack of knowledge on her part and not for any improper
    purpose.  In any event, the brief
    endorsement of Nelson J. states, “support orders are not stayed”, which suggests
    that he was at least aware of the bankruptcy.  </p>
  <h2>Should the Court hear the appeals of Mr. Higgins?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a serious question as to whether the court
    should entertain Mr. Higgins’ appeals, given that he made no effort to move to
    set aside the order striking his pleadings.  In my view, we should not hear the appeals for the following reasons.  First, pursuant to rule 10(5)(b) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99 he is
    not entitled to appeal the orders in question.  Rule 10(5)(b) provides :</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If a respondent does not
    serve and file an answer as this rule requires, <u>or if the answer is struck
    out by an order</u>, the respondent is not entitled to participate in the case
    in any way… [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While there may be some cases in which a court
    should grant relief from the strict operation of this rule, in my view, this is
    not one.  As noted, Mr. Higgins has made
    no serious effort to comply with his ongoing support obligations.  In these circumstances, he is not entitled to
    special consideration from this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, in respect of the disclosure order, that
    order is clearly interlocutory and no appeal lies to this court.  I am of the view that the support order is
    also interlocutory in that it does not finally determine the child support
    issues as between the parties.  Indeed,
    in his endorsement, Nelson J. notes that he is changing a previous “temporary”
    order made by another judge based on the current cost of education.  There has not yet been a trial in this
    matter.  This can hardly be characterized
    as a final order, and no appeal to this court lies from it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, and in any event, given the circumstances
    of this case, and in particular Mr. Higgins’ failure to make any serious effort
    to pay the ongoing support owed to Mrs. Higgins, this court has discretion to
    decline to hear his appeals pending compliance.  See <i>Dickie v. Dickie </i>(2007),
    279 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 625 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given my conclusions on Mr. Higgins’ status to
    bring these appeals, it is unnecessary to deal with the issue raised by the
    order given by the Registrar in Bankruptcy.  That said, I do observe that ss. 69.41(1) and 121(4) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.
    1985, c. B-3 provide that the stay of proceedings against a bankrupt person set
    out under s. 69.3(1) of that Act does not apply to claims for child or spousal
    support under any court order or agreement.  However, what the scope of that provision may be is better left to
    another case.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In view of the fact that Mr. Higgins is not
    entitled to proceed with his appeals because of the prohibition in rule
    10(5)(b) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> and
    further in view of the fact that both orders against him are interlocutory, I
    would quash his appeals.  It is therefore
    unnecessary to exercise this court’s discretion pursuant to <i>Dickie</i>.  I would grant Mrs. Higgins her costs of both the appeals on a partial
    indemnity scale.  Mrs. Higgins may make
    submissions as to the quantum of costs in writing within ten days of the
    release of these reasons, limited to three pages double-spaced.</p>
  <h2> The Disclosure Appeal of Ms. Fisher</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Fisher is not a party to these proceedings.  The order against her is a final order as the
    issue between her and Mrs. Higgins is finally determined.  Ms. Fisher therefore has a right of appeal to
    this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the order against Ms. Fisher is far
    too broad.  It requires her to provide
    all of her financial records, without limitation, from January 2003 (prior to
    meeting Mr. Higgins in September 2003).  The order then goes on to detail an exhaustive list of financial
    documents which, with one exception, are not in any way limited to Mr.
    Higgins.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What Mrs. Higgins is entitled to by way of
    financial disclosure from Ms. Fisher should be limited to financial and
    business transactions between Ms. Fisher and Mr. Higgins insofar as they
    reflect Mr. Higgins’ financial position since September 2003.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would therefore allow Ms. Fisher’s appeal and
    set aside paragraph 2 of the order of Perkins J. dated July 25, 2006.  In its place, paragraph 2 shall provide that
    all documents and information in respect of financial and/or business
    transactions between Ms. Fisher and Mr. Higgins since September 2003 including through
    companies owned or controlled by Ms. Fisher or in which she has an interest, shall
    be produced and client names and contact information are to be deleted from
    such documents.  Such documents and
    information are to be produced within 60 days of the release of these reasons.  This order is without prejudice to Mrs.
    Higgins’ right to apply for further disclosure should the circumstances require
    it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Fisher is entitled to her costs of the
    appeal and the costs of the appearance before Perkins J. on a partial indemnity
    scale.  Ms. Fisher may make submissions
    as to the quantum of costs in writing within ten days of the release of these
    reasons limited to three pages double-spaced.  Mrs. Higgins may respond to the costs submissions in writing limited to
    three pages double-spaced within seventeen days of the release of these
    reasons.</p>
