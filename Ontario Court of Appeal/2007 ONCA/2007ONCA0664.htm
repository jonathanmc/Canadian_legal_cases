  <h2>Factual Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This factual summary is taken from the reasons
    of Killeen J.  In October 2000, the Ford
    Motor Company entered into an agreement with Dana to build frames for the 2004
    Ford F-150 pickup truck.  This project
    was code-named “P221”.  The annual volume
    of frames was expected to be approximately 615,000 over a period of eight
    years.  It was agreed that Dana would
    divide its production between its plant in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Marys,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and its plant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Elizabethtown,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Kentucky.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In order to carry out this contract, Dana
    arranged for the construction of a 160,000-square-foot addition to its St. Marys
    plant and for the installation of a custom-designed frame assembly line for the
    F-150 Ford trucks which were to be in production and ready for sale in September
    2003.  The trial judge described the
    building addition as a “flexible generic type of industrial building”.  It is the assembly line that is at issue in
    this appeal.  Rumble Automation Inc.
    (“Rumble”) was the successful bidder for the design and installation of the
    assembly line in the new addition to the St. Marys plant as well as a similar
    assembly line at Dana’s plant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabethtown,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Kentucky.  Rumble is now bankrupt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plan was to build the assembly line systems
    at sites in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga
    where the lines would be tested and then disassembled and transported to St.
    Marys and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabethtown
    where they would be reassembled and installed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rumble carried out much of the work through
    subcontractors.  Part of this work was subcontracted
    to Kennedy.  For the St. Marys plant, it was
    Kennedy’s responsibility to disassemble the line at the build sites and deliver
    the various parts by 165 transport trucks provided by Empire Transportation Ltd.
    to St. Marys where Kennedy employees would install the line in the new 160,000-square-foot
    addition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kennedy also operated through
    subcontractors.  It was assisted by
    Cassidy at the St. Marys plant.  The
    process of disassembling, transporting and reassembling in St. Marys took from
    the end of September 2002 to early December 2002.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fully installed assembly line consists of
    100 mezzanine platforms and 165 robots.  The assembly line is attached to the floor by a system of some 2,000 to
    3,000 mechanical and chemical bolts ranging from one-quarter to three-eighths
    of an inch in width and from six to eight inches in length.  The assembly line covers approximately
    100,000 square feet of the new addition.  It is twenty feet high and weighs approximately 500,000 tons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The new addition also housed two other assembly
    lines that were installed by other companies and used to supplement the
    production of the F-150 truck frame line.  These two lines were involved in the electronic painting, waxing and
    stacking of the F-150 frames.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In December 2002, a dispute arose between Rumble
    and Kennedy.  Kennedy was locked out of
    the site by Rumble.  As a result, Kennedy
    and its subcontractors, including Cassidy, registered the lien claims at issue
    in this litigation.</p>
  <h2>The Judgment at Trial</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice Haines of the Superior Court of Justice
    ordered a trial of an issue in this matter.  He set out the issue as follows: “whether the work performed by the
    plaintiff is properly lienable under the <i>Construction
    Lien Act.</i>”  The trial of an issue
    proceeded before Killeen J. in January 2004 and his reasons were released on
    November 26, 2004.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge started his analysis of the
    issue before him by reference to s. 14(1) of the CLA which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>14.(1)  A person who supplies services or materials
    to an improvement for an owner, contractor or subcontractor, has a lien upon
    the interest of the owner in the premises improved for the price of those
    services or materials.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>He then considered the definitions of
    the terms “improvement” and “land” in s. 1(1) of the CLA:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“improvement” means,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Any alteration, addition or repair to, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Any construction, erection or installation on,
    any land, and includes the demolition or removal of any building, structure or
    works or any part thereof, and “improved” has a corresponding meaning;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“land” includes any
    building, structure or works affixed to the land, or an appurtenance to any of
    them, but does not include the improvement[.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge conducted a thorough review of
    the authorities that related to the issue before him.  He started by considering the Supreme Court
    of Canada’s approach to the interpretation of the predecessor <i>Mechanics’ Lien Act,</i> R.S.O. 1960, c. 233.  In <i>Clarkson
    Co. Ltd. v. Ace Lumber Ltd.,</i> [1963] S.C.R. 110 at p. 114, Ritchie J. quoted
    with approval the dissent of Kelly J. in <i>Ace
    Lumber Ltd. v. Clarkson Co. Ltd.</i>, [1960] O.R. 748 at 757-58 as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With the greatest
    respect, I am, however, of the opinion that the proper approach to the
    interpretation of this statute is expressed in the dissenting opinion of Kelly
    J.A. where he says that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    lien commonly known as the mechanics’ lien was unknown to the common law and
    owes its existence in Ontario to a series of statutes, the latest of which is
    R.S.O. 1960, c. 233.  It constitutes an
    abrogation of the common law to the extent that it creates, in the specified
    circumstances, a charge upon the owner’s lands which would not exist but for
    the Act, and grants to one class of creditors a security or preference not
    enjoyed by all creditors of the same debtor; accordingly, while the statute may
    merit a liberal inter-pretation with respect to the rights it confers upon
    those to whom it applies, it must be given a strict interpretation in
    determining whether any lien-claimant is a person to whom a lien is given by
    it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also referred to the report of
    the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on the Draft Construction Lien Act of
    April 8, 1982 and in particular the definition of the word “improvement” in the
    proposed legislation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The definition of the
    term improvement has been redrafted to make it clear which types of work on
    land gives rise to a lien.  The purpose
    of the Act is to protect those who contribute their services or materials
    towards the making of an improvement to a premises.  The types of work which constitute an
    improvement are set out in clauses a and b.  <u>While the definition of “improvement” is broad, the Committee has
    attempted to draft it in such a way that it will be clear that the lien created
    by the Act applies only in the case of the construction and building repair
    industries.</u> [Emphasis added by Killeen J.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also cited the decision of this
    court in <i>Central Supply Co. (1972) Ltd.
    v. Modern Tile Supply Co. Ltd.</i> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 783 at para. 15 where
    Abella J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    purpose of the definition of “improvement”, as set out in the <i>Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory
    Committee on the Draft Construction Lien Act</i>…was “to protect those who
    contribute their services or materials towards the making of an improvement to
    a premises”.  The report also stressed
    that while the definition of improvement was a broad one, it was drafted to
    make it clear that the lien created by the Act applied “only in the case of the
    construction and building repair industries.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also relied upon <i>Hubert v. Shinder</i>, [1952] O.W.N. 146 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In that case, this court considered whether
    the repair and installation of laundry equipment in a building was covered by
    the <i>Mechanics’ Lien Act</i>.  The court held that the laundry machinery was
    “not part of or an improvement to the building so as to constitute a
    lien.”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge referred to the judgment of the
    New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>Beloit
    Canada Ltd. v. Fundy Forest Industries Ltd.</i> (1981), 127 D.L.R. (3d) 320
    which he found “followed basically the same rationale as the Ontario Court of
    Appeal did in <i>Hubert</i>.”  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Beloit</i>, the
    court found that a corrugating paper machine which weighed 2,500,000 pounds
    installed on a concrete foundation in a building but removable from it was not
    an improvement under the <i>Mechanics’ Lien
    Act</i>, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 142 [now R.S.N.B. 1973, c. M-6].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also considered the judgment of
    Rosenberg J. in <i>Baltimore Aircoil of
    Canada Inc. v. Process Cooling Systems Inc.</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 324 (Gen.
    Div.).  In that case, Rosenberg J., on a
    motion for summary judgment, found that the CLA did not apply to the

    free-standing improvement on its own within the <i>CLA</i> having regard to the principles arising from the decisional law
    in Ontario and the peculiar facts of this case.  I conclude that the assembly line installation represented the
    installation of manufacturing equipment in a building but did not constitute an
    improvement or part of an improvement within the Act.</p>

    that were also cited by the trial judge.  The first case, <i>Spears Sales &amp;

    plant.  O’Driscoll J. referred to the
    following excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Boyle Co. Ct. J. at 198:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Did the pumps become
    part of the realty?  They may have so
    been intended as between this lessor and this lessee but that is not
    determinative.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Based in considerable
    part upon the affidavit filed on behalf of Westpine, my original focus was upon
    the use of the building and the function of the business in the building.  That function has been primarily fish
    packing.  The pumping system is an
    integral part of that function.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But the question must be
    answered by looking not to the parties but to the realty.  The question is: are the pumps an integral
    part of the function of the building?  The question does not concern the function of the business it houses
    (although buildings and improvements may function in specific ways to suit a
    business).  The question because of its
    statutory basis must be answered in strict terms.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this light this
    pumping system is not an improvement.  Judgment accordingly.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is apparent that the dissenting judge took a
    different view of the evidence than the trial judge and, in particular,
    questioned his “undue emphasis on the alleged <i>portability</i> of the assembly line components.”  [Emphasis in original.]  In this respect, she said at paras. 101 and
    102 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It appears to me,
    however, that the learned trial judge placed undue emphasis on the alleged <i>portability</i> of the assembly line
    components, particularly where the evidence indicated that the cost to remove
    them would be enormous (over $10 million) and given that the intention of the
    parties was a projection of at least eight years of use.  Moreover, the issue of permanence constitutes
    only one factor to be considered in the determination of whether a claim for
    lien exists, and permanence itself is a flexible term.  See, for example, <i>Boomars, supra</i>.  [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, by concentrating
    on the matter of portability, Killeen J. may well have ignored important
    factors tending to show that the P221 project was viewed by the parties as a
    whole.  For example:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dana
    issued purchase orders to Stantec to design the industrial building for
    expansion and to Rumble for the design, build and install of the assembly line
    on the same date, December 17, 2001.  Moreover, though their work proceeded independently and at different
    times, both arms refer to the P221 Project.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whereas
    the building expansion involved an expenditure of about $7 million, it cost
    approximately $44 million to design, build and install the assembly line. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Though
    the construction of the building was substantially complete when Kennedy and
    its subtrades began the installation of the assembly line at St. Mary’s, a
    period of overlap existed where the building was completed and the assembly
    line was being installed in the St. Mary’s plant.  Indeed, at page 4 of his judgment, Killeen J.
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>The concrete history of the new F150
    assembly line starts in the summer of 2002, roughly about the time of
    substantial performance of the building addition, although it is clear it was
    always part of the P221 Project or contract as far back as 2000.  [Emphasis added by Chapnik J.]</p>

    stated may have been ignored by the trial judge.  She finished her review of the evidence as
    follows at para. 107:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   The assembly line, as constructed, was
    proposed to last about eight years.  Its
    various components were attached to the floor and hooked up to services in a
    massive and secure manner.  In my view,
    the facts can lead to no other conclusion but that there was such a degree of
    substantial attachment between the installation and the premises, specifically
    built for this purpose, that a reasonable person would consider the premises to
    have been improved as a result of the installation of the assembly line at St.
    Mary’s.</p>

    concluded that, “the learned trial judge proceeded on a wrong principle and
    misapplied the law to the facts when he reached the conclusions he did.”  Relying on <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, she held that the trial
    judge’s error “amounted to an extricable error in principle” which was subject
    to appellate review on a standard of correctness.</p>

    in that case, had done some removal and demolition of parts of an assembly line
    and constructed and installed replacement parts.  Rumble argued that “the equipment supplied comes
    within the definition of ‘improve-ment under the Act and may be considered ‘works’
    as that term is used in the definition, thereby entitling it to a lien.”  However, the court did not decide the issue.  It was raised on a summary judgment motion
    and the motion judge concluded only that there was a genuine issue for
    trial.  The fact that the motion judge
    found that there was a genuine issue for trial does not decide the issue.  I do not find that <i>Re A.G. Simpson Co.</i> advances Kennedy’s argument.</p>

    palpable and overriding error.  I do not agree
    that the trial judge committed palpable and overriding error in making this

    the finding.  The assembly line had been
    built and disassembled before being transported to St. Marys for
    installation.  The assembly line could be
    readily disconnected from the addition to the plant with no damage to the plant
    or its services.  Moreover, Dana had a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Hubert</i> is a ten paragraph judgment.  There were
    three issues in the appeal, only one of which relates to the issue before
    us.  In <i>Hubert</i>, the claim for a lien under the <i>Mechanics’ Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1950, related to the connection of
    laundry machinery to the water and sewage systems of a building.  The machinery had originally been installed
    in the building but had been damaged by fire and had been taken off site for
    repair.  In finding that there was no
    legitimate claim for a lien, the court said at page 147:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The appellant next
    contended that the claims of the respon-dents Nesbitt and Erskine Smith &amp;
    Company Limited are not for any work, service or material falling within the
    provisions of s. 5(1) of the Act.  With
    great respect to the trial judge I am of the opinion that the evidence as to
    this particular work and the materials supplied does not support his finding
    that the same were such as to constitute a lien on the interest of the owner in
    the realty.  While the building had been
    used for laundry purposes and was being so restored following a fire,
    nevertheless it is manifest from a perusal of the evidence that the work and
    material of these two claimants do not fall within the section of the Act
    establishing a lien.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The work and materials
    supplied by the respondent Nesbitt were performed and supplied jointly if not solely
    in the rehabilitation of the laundry machinery which had previously been
    installed in the building and which was damaged by the fire.  This work was in the main completed off the
    premises in question.  The claim of the
    respondent Erskine, Smith &amp; Company Limited was for attaching the laundry
    machinery to the water and sewage systems already installed in the building on
    the premises.  It was not a part of or an
    improvement to the building so as to constitute a lien.  In this regard I respectfully believe the
    learned trial judge was in error.  In my
    opinion the evidence clearly supports the contention that the materials
    supplied and the work in the installation of such materials were respectively
    moveables and work in the installation of moveables and neither could be
    classed as “used in the making, constructing, erecting, fitting, altering,
    improving or repairing of” the erection or building in question, as provided in
    s. 5(1).</p>

    by the trial judge from the case at bar both on the facts and in respect of the
    relevant statutory provisions where a different statutory provision is in
    issue.  That said, what emerges from the
    brief reasons of the <i>Hubert</i> case is
    that a mechanics’ lien will not arise where the work and materials have been
    applied in respect of an installation that is moveable (i.e. portable) and not
    an integral part of the building.  A
    moveable installation does not improve the building in which it is located as
    it does not become a part of the building.</p>

    installation might have been sufficiently extensive in scope to constitute
    improving the plant so as to give rise to a claim for lien.  It was only after the evidence was heard by
    the Master that it was determined that the work was not such as would give rise
    to a claim for lien, but constituted work in the installation of moveables.  In this respect it is similar to <i>Hubert v. Shinder, supra,</i> where a
    personal judgment was granted in parallel circumstances.</p>

    articulated by the trial judge.  I think
    it is too broad.  Each case will depend
    on its facts.  In most cases, the
    installation or repair of machinery used in a business operated in a building,
    particularly where the machinery is portable, will not give rise to lien rights
    under the CLA.  On the other hand, where machinery
    is installed in a building for the use of a business and is completely and
    permanently integrated into the building, a lien claim will arise.  However, based on the findings of fact made
    by the trial judge in this case, it was open for him to find that no lien claim
    arose.  </p>

    of the other cases cited by counsel on both sides of this issue is that they
    are fact-driven.  Whether they fall

    exercise.  While a trial judge must apply
    the statutory definition of “improvement” to the evidence and he or she is
    therefore engaged in deciding a question of mixed fact and law, the factual
    determination is by far the more significant element in the exercise.</p>

    directly from the discussion concerning portability.  Counsel for Kennedy cites two British
    Columbia Court of Appeal cases in respect of the permanency factor.  In <i>Boomars
    Plumbing &amp; Heating Ltd., supra</i>, the court held that modular units
    previously used in construction camps and installed on vacant land for use as a
    motel constituted improvements under the B.C. legislation.  The units were installed without any
    foundation and secured by their own weight.  In discussing the issue of permanency, the court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“permanent” is a
    relative term which does not necessarily involve remaining in the same state
    and place forever or for an indefinitely long period.  It is used in contradistinction to “occasional”.  If the thing is intended to remain in place
    so long as it serves its purpose, that satisfies the element of permanency.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the second case, <i>Deal S.r.l., supra</i>, the court held that the supply of moulds that were
    used to form concrete components for a rapid transit project constituted an
    improvement and that the material supplier had a right to claim a lien.  In addressing the issue of permanency, the
    court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Moreover, it is clear
    that the moulds were intended to be in place for at least the duration of the
    project which, in the context of this case and the purpose of the moulds and
    the shed, is a substantial time sufficient to satisfy the require-ments of the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Kennedy also relies on the following
    excerpt from <i>Construction Lien Remedies
    in Ontario</i> (2d ed.), by Kevin Patrick McGuiness at pp. 62-63:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   Moreover, there is case law which clearly
    suggests that the permanence of a structure erected or installed is only one of
    a number of criteria that may be considered in deciding whether a premises has
    been improved.  Thus it has been held
    that the mere fact that a building or structure may be removed in some way is
    not in itself sufficient to prevent its construction from being considered to
    be an improvement.  Modern engineering
    techniques permit virtually every structure to be removed from one site and re-assembled
    elsewhere.  The key question in many
    cases is to decide whether the installation of a particular thing has caused a
    sufficient change to be made to the premises so that its installation has enhanced
    the value, beauty or utility of the premises itself.  The fact that the thing installed has not
    become completely or irreversibly affixed to the land on which it sits is not
    necessarily conclusive of the question of whether the premises have been
    improved (although the installation of a fixture will clearly give rise to a
    lien).  The court may also consider
    whether there is such a degree of substantial attachment between the thing
    installed and the premises on which the installation was made, that a
    reasonable person would consider the premises to have been improved as a result
    of the installation.  Although this is a
    difficult test to satisfy, provided it is satisfied then even a temporary
    structure may be seen to constitute an improve-ment.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Cassidy raises essentially the same
    arguments as does counsel for Kennedy.  In addition to the many authorities cited by counsel for Kennedy,
    counsel for Cassidy relies upon a critique of the trial judge’s decision
    contained in a paper by John Margie &amp; Martin Rotterdam, “Recent<i> </i>Developments in Construction Lien Law”,
    presented to the Ontario Bar Association – Continuing Legal Education, October
    7, 2005.  The authors of the paper give
    the following critique of the trial judge’s decision at pages 6 and 7:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Kennedy</i> decision is problematic.  The main problem is the court’s refusal to regard the entire project as
    an integrated project.  While it may very
    well be true that the building addition that housed the line would not be
    damaged if the line were removed, the fact is that without the line, the
    building itself would be useless and be of no value.  The building was built for the sole purpose
    of housing the line.  While it would
    surely constitute an “improvement” with the line in it, it would be nothing but
    an empty shell without it.  There is a
    world of difference between installing an immensely complex robotic assembly
    line in a building built specifically for that purpose and repairing and
    reinstalling washing machines which had been previously installed in a
    building, as was the case in <i>Hubert v.
    Shinder</i>, the Ontario Court of Appeal case relied upon by the court in <i>Kennedy</i>.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Beloit</i>, another case relied upon by the
    court, it was held that there was no evidence that the machine in question was
    furnished with the intention that it form part of the building.  Again, in <i>Kennedy</i>,
    not only was the line supposed to form part of the building, the sole purpose
    of the building was to house the line.  Why then differentiate between the two?  Why not treat it as an integrated project?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As for the argument that
    the line was intended solely to enhance the manufacturing process or used
    solely for the operation of a business inside the building, is the same not
    true for the building addition itself?  Presumably, any commercial project is built for the operation of a
    business.  What about work done by or on
    behalf of a commercial tenant?  Under
    standard leases, upon termination of a lease, a tenant has to leave the
    premises behind as they were when the tenant first moved in.  The sole purpose of work done by tenants is
    to improve the operation of the business conducted inside the building.  Should such work therefore generally be unlienable?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the authors of the above paper say that the
    main problem is the court’s refusal to regard the entire project as an
    integrated project they are, in effect, saying that the trial judge made an
    error in his finding of facts.  As I have
    already said, I am satisfied that the trial judge was justified in making such
    a finding even though another judge may have come to a different
    conclusion.  As an appellate court, we
    are bound by a long line of cases, including <i>Housen, supra</i>, that prevents us from interfering with findings of
    fact by a trial judge, or indeed findings of mixed fact and law, in cases such
    as this, unless we can find palpable and overriding error.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not agree with the authors of the paper
    when they say that the building addition would be useless and of no value
    without the F-150 assembly line.  There
    is simply no evidence to support that conclusion.  The suggestion that without the assembly
    line, the building would be nothing but an empty shell is mere
    speculation.  Dana has been involved in
    the automobile manufacturing business for many years and is presumably in a
    position to use the building addition for other purposes if it decides to do
    so.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the second paragraph of the above quotation
    the authors of the paper appear to suggest that the trial judge’s theory
    concerning the lienability of machinery used in a business is too broadly
    stated.  In my view, they carry the
    analysis beyond the point suggested by the trial judge when they apply it to
    the building itself.  However, as I have
    said, I accept that the trial judge’s theory is too broadly stated.  I have also said that in this case, given the
    findings of fact of the trial judge, I cannot conclude that the trial judge
    erred in the result.</p>

    argument.  He submits that the work that Cassidy
    did in St. Marys is traditionally lienable work and, even though Cassidy did
    this work as a subcontractor of Kennedy, it should be entitled to a
    construction lien irrespective of the entitlement of Kennedy.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The lienable work that Cassidy refers to is the
    supply and installation of 2,000 to 3,000 chemical and mechanical anchors to
    the floor.  In addition, Cassidy painted
    lines on the floor to establish the location of the assembly line within the
    building.  Counsel further submits that
    its work physically altered the building and constituted an “improvement” under
    the CLA. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Dana responds to the above argument
    by referring to the evidence of the president of Cassidy who, in
    cross-examination at trial, testified that in its subcontract work it neither altered
    the building nor modified the floor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the work carried out by Cassidy was
    part and parcel of the work carried out by Kennedy and I see no basis to treat
    it any differently.  I would not give
    effect to this argument.</p>
