  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>BY
    THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions for the first
    degree murder of his two-year-old son and the aggravated assault of his
    common-law spouse.  At his own request,
    the appellant was not represented by counsel.  The court appointed Mr. Delmar Doucette to act as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  Mr. Doucette
    raised a number of issues on behalf of the appellant and also assisted the
    appellant in his presentation of his argument.  We wish to record the court’s appreciation for Mr. Doucette’s assistance
    in this difficult case.  For the
    following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INEFFECTIVE
    ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal ground of appeal raised by both the appellant
    and Mr. Doucette concern allegations that the appellant did not receive
    effective assistance of counsel from his trial lawyer.  Prior to the trial, the relationship between
    the appellant and his trial counsel deteriorated, at least in part, because
    trial counsel had presented to the appellant options of pleading guilty to
    second degree murder or relying on a defence of not criminally responsible on
    account of mental disorder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we will describe below, the case that the appellant
    killed his son was overwhelming.  The
    options presented to the appellant by his trial counsel were not only
    reasonable but he would have been derelict in his duty not to have explored
    these options with Crown counsel and the appellant.  The appellant rejected both options.  He denied that he killed his son and asserted
    that he was not mentally ill.  Trial
    counsel accepted those instructions and attempted to prepare for trial.  Regrettably, the appellant thereafter refused
    on many occasions to meet with his counsel or provide him with instructions
    concerning the conduct of the case.  Prior
    to the trial, counsel attempted to remove himself from the record, but this
    motion was not ruled upon since the appellant seemed to be willing to continue
    his relationship with counsel.  The
    difficulties continued, but the appellant never asked to have counsel removed
    from the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the appellant and <i>amicus</i> argued that the appellant did not have the effective
    assistance of counsel.  The appellant
    argued that his counsel was inexperienced and incompetent.  <i>Amicus</i> argued that due to the breakdown in the relationship, the appellant did not
    receive competent representation.  We
    deal first with the appellant’s submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s submissions all centre on his claim
    that he did not commit the offence and that trial counsel should have
    cross-examined the various Crown witnesses to demonstrate that he did not kill
    his son.  As we have said, the evidence
    was overwhelming that the appellant killed his son.  There was no cross-examination that could
    have undermined this fact.  The <i>uncontradicted</i> evidence showed that the
    appellant attended at the home of his estranged wife, struck her with a hammer
    and, when she fled the home, he was alone with the deceased.  There was no one else in the house during the
    short time that the child was strangled and then repeatedly stabbed.  On that evidence alone, the appellant would
    have been found to be responsible for the killing of his son.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown adduced other evidence.  The appellant’s palm print was found on a
    knife that was undoubtedly used to stab the deceased.  The appellant complains that counsel should
    have cross-examined the fingerprint examiner on the theory that the local
    police and the RCMP conspired in some way to incriminate him with the
    fingerprint evidence.  This theory is
    based on the fact that the appellant’s name was spelt incorrectly on one form
    and that the examiner therefore obtained another set of prints from the
    RCMP.  This theory is patently absurd and
    trial counsel properly avoided any such cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DNA evidence showed that the deceased’s blood was found
    on the appellant’s shirt.  The appellant
    suggests that defence counsel should have cross-examined the DNA expert to the
    effect that experts make mistakes.  There
    was no point to any such examination.  The appellant had been at the scene, his son had been stabbed many
    times.  The suggestion that someone
    else’s blood was on the appellant’s shirt is also absurd.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that trial counsel should have
    cross-examined his spouse.  There was no
    point to any such examination, at least as it related to the issue of who was
    responsible for the killing.  There was
    no contest at trial or even now that the appellant was in the house at the time
    of the killing and that his spouse did not actually see the appellant stabbing
    his son.  There was no cross-examination
    that could have been conducted of the spouse that would have advanced the
    appellant’s theory that he did not commit the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To obtain a new trial on the basis of ineffective
    assistance of counsel, the appellant must show that counsel’s acts and
    omissions constitute incompetence and that a miscarriage of justice resulted
    from this incompetence.  Insofar as the
    appellant bases his incompetence argument on the theory that he did not kill
    the deceased, he meets neither branch of the test.  Counsel’s decisions not to cross-examine on
    the matters about which the appellant complains were reasonable and, in any
    event, the failure to cross-examine did not prejudice the appellant in any
    respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> presents a more focused ineffective assistance of counsel argument.  He submits that there was a real issue at
    trial as to whether the murder was planned and deliberate.  He submits that a critical piece of evidence
    relied upon by the Crown concerned the testimony of the appellant’s spouse
    about a threat the appellant made to her shortly before the killing.  He submits that defence counsel should have
    cross-examined this witness to demonstrate that they had an on-going
    relationship and attempt to show that he did not threaten her in the telephone
    call.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to understand the factual context for
    this submission.  At the time of the
    killing, the appellant was on bail as a result of having assaulted his
    wife.  He was to go on trial the next day
    for this assault charge.  It was a term
    of his bail that he stay away from his spouse.  Counsel for the Crown did not lead any of this evidence.  At the end of the spouse’s direct evidence,
    all that the jury knew was that the next day the spouse was to testify about
    something in relation to the appellant.  As Crown counsel, Ms. Kingston, points out, cross-examination of the
    spouse on the relationship was very much a double-edged sword.  Had defence counsel cross-examined to attempt
    to establish an on-going relationship, the Crown would have been entitled to
    lead evidence of the earlier assault and the fact that the appellant was on
    bail for that offence and was about to go to trial for that charge the day
    after the killing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This evidence would have significantly strengthened the
    Crown’s case that this was a planned and deliberate murder.  It would have provided evidence of <i>animus</i> towards the spouse, strengthened
    the revenge motive alleged by the Crown and provided evidence of a motive to
    kill her to prevent her from testifying.  In those circumstances, the decision not to cross-examine in the manner
    now suggested by <i>amicus</i> was a
    reasonable tactical decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is one other point that needs to be made in
    relation to this ground of appeal.  Defence counsel is now deceased.  However, junior counsel who assisted trial counsel, has provided
    evidence about the relationship between the appellant and counsel.  She testified that after the trial, defence
    counsel told her that in light of the appellant’s testimony at trial he wished
    he had cross-examined the spouse on the fact that she met with the appellant on
    several occasions prior to the killing.  <i>Amicus</i> argues that this clearly
    demonstrates that defence counsel recognized that he failed to conduct a
    competent defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.  Counsel’s comment must be put in context.  When the spouse completed her examination-in-chief,
    defence counsel said he expected that his cross-examination would be brief but
    asked for a recess to speak to the appellant.  The trial judge granted the request.  However, the appellant refused to speak to counsel and refused to tell him
    what he would say when he testified.  As
    it turned out, the appellant, against the advice of his counsel, testified and
    in his own examination-in-chief<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> discussed the assault charge.  Counsel
    can hardly be blamed now for failing to cross-examine when the appellant
    refused to provide him with the necessary instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CHARGE
    TO THE JURY ON AFTER-THE-FACT CONDUCT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After killing his son, the appellant fled the house and
    then lay down on the ground where he was found by the police.  After he was arrested, the appellant asked
    the officers to kill him.  The Crown
    relied upon this evidence as consciousness of guilt.  The trial judge instructed the jury that they
    could take this evidence into account in determining whether the appellant
    committed the offence charged.  <i>Amicus</i> submits that this was an error;
    that this evidence may have been relevant on the issue of whether the appellant
    committed the killing but was not relevant as to whether this was a planned and
    deliberate murder.  We agree with <i>amicus</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are also satisfied, however, that no substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted from this error. First, having given
    the impugned instruction, the trial judge immediately told the jury that in his
    opinion this evidence would not assist in determining the appellant’s state of
    mind, although admittedly he told the jury that issue was for them.  More importantly, when he came to deal with
    planning and deliberation, the trial judge listed, in detail, the evidence upon
    which the Crown relied to show planning and deliberation.  He did not refer to the after-the-fact
    conduct.  We think that given these
    instructions there is no possibility that the jury relied upon this evidence on
    the issue of planning and deliberation.  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this argument.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CHARGE
    TO THE JURY ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> submits that the trial judge erred in his charge by setting up a credibility
    contest between the appellant and his spouse about the contents of the
    threatening telephone call.  In his
    testimony, the appellant denied making the threat.  We agree with <i>amicus</i> that the content of this call was important, but we do not
    agree that the trial judge erred.  The
    trial judge invited the jury to compare the two versions of the call and to ask
    themselves who they believed and who was the best person to decide whether
    there was a threat.  <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 prohibits the trier of fact from
    treating the standard of proof as a credibility contest but it does not
    prohibit a trier of fact from assessing the accused’s testimony in light of the
    whole evidence.  Thus, it is open to the
    trier of fact to assess the credibility of the accused’s evidence by comparing
    it to the contradictory evidence adduced by the Crown.  See <i>R.
    v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hull</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 3177 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In our view, the impugned instruction was not
    inconsistent with <i>R. v. W. (D.).</i> In
    other parts of the charge the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury on the
    burden and onus of proof and virtually the last instruction given to the jury
    was the <i>R. v. W. (D.) </i>instruction.  Accordingly, we would also not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
