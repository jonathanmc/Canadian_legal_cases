  <p>[1]       Mr. Amos was
    found guilty, after trial by jury, of two counts of trafficking cocaine and one
    count of possession of proceeds of crime.  On appeal, Mr. Amos raised two issues.  First, he argues that the trial judge breached his Charter rights by
    refusing to review the exercise by the Crown of one of its peremptory
    challenges.  The appellant contends that
    the Crown’s peremptory challenge to the only proposed black juror, where there
    was nothing to suggest that the potential juror was unsuitable, brings the case
    outside the parameters established by <i>R.
    v. Gayle</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (Ont. C.A.).  Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing to properly emphasize, in her charge, that neither the
    “buy money” nor the drugs were found at the time of the appellant’s
    arrest.    </p>
  <p> [2]      We see no basis on which to interfere with
    the trial judge’s ruling that the Crown’s use of a peremptory challenge did not
    violate the appellant’s Charter rights.  In <i>Gayle</i>, this court
    reiterated that an accused person does not have the right to insist that he or
    she be tried by a jury that includes one or more individuals who share some
    particular racial, cultural, ethnic, linguistic or other such
    characteristic.  As the trial judge
    noted, relying on <i>Gayle</i> at para. 75:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the multi-racial society in which we live, the
    random selection of juries cannot be expected to result in panels that include
    members having specific racial identities.  No one can reasonably complain of being tried by a jury that did not
    happen to be representative in its membership.</p>
  <p>[3]       The trial
    judge considered the Crown’s actions when exercising its peremptory
    challenges.  She found no pattern in the
    Crown’s actions that would suggest the challenges had been exercised in an
    arbitrary manner nor did she see anything to suggest that the Crown exercised
    its discretion other than in conformity with Charter principles and
    values.  Accordingly, she saw no basis
    for reviewing the Crown’s exercise of a peremptory challenge.  </p>
  <p>[4]       After noting
    that there were persons who were representatives of visible minorities on the
    panel, the trial judge concluded that there had been no breach of the
    appellant’s right to a fair and impartial trial when the jury challenge process
    was considered as a whole, including the process of challenge for cause and
    peremptory challenge.</p>
  <p>[5]       We see
    nothing in the second ground of appeal.  There is nothing inadequate or improper in the trial judge reiterating
    that no buy money or drugs were found on the appellant or located at the scene
    where the transactions took place in the context of a review of the defence
    theory.  </p>
  <p>[6]       Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the appeal.     </p>
