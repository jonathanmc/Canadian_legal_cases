    applicants seek a stay of the ruling of the Commissioner of the Cornwall
    Public Inquiry that he had jurisdiction to hear the evidence of two witnesses,
    and the decision of the Divisional Court dismissing an application for an
    order directing the Commissioner to state a case as to his jurisdiction to
    make that order, pending determination of an application for leave to appeal
    the order of the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    witnesses, designated as “C-12” and “C-13”, are scheduled to testify commencing
    tomorrow.  An outline of their evidence indicates that C-12 will testify
    that in 1993, at the age of 16, she complained to the police of a sexual
    assault committed by two teenaged males.  Her complaint was made the day
    after the alleged sexual assault. She and her mother, C-13, will testify
    that the OPP officers to whom they complained failed to the respond to or
    act upon the complaint in an appropriate fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner ruled that the impugned evidence fell within his mandate to
    investigate “allegations of historical abuse of young people in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cornwall area”.  The majority in the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court rejected the argument that “historical” necessarily referred
    to acts that occurred a considerable time before they were reported and that “abuse” necessarily
    referred to acts committed by persons in a position of trust or authority.  The
    majority ruled that the Commissioner was in the best position to assess the
    relevance of the evidence to his mandate.  The dissenting judge found that
    taken to its logical conclusion, the Commissioner’s interpretation of “allegations
    of historical abuse” would include all allegations of sexual abuse made prior
    to the establishment of the Commission and that this yielded an unacceptably
    wide interpretation of the Commissioner’s jurisdiction. </p>

    test for a stay was established in <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v.
    <st1:country-region

    (Attorney General)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at para 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First, a preliminary
    assessment must be made of the merits of the case to ensure that there is
    a serious question to be tried.  Secondly, it must be determined whether
    the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the application were refused.  Finally,
    an assessment must be made as to which of the parties would suffer greater
    harm from the granting or refusal of the remedy pending a decision on the
    merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Commissioner takes no position as to the first step.  The threshold
    is a low one and I am satisfied from the dissenting reasons in the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that a serious question is raised as to the correctness
    of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the second step and the issue of irreparable harm, the applicants
    submit that permitting C-12 and C-13 to testify in public will impugn their
    reputation and integrity and that the damage thereby occasioned will not
    adequately be relieved if the appeal succeeds.  The respondent submits that
    the applicants will suffer no irreparable harm if leave to appeal is granted
    and the appeal succeeds.  The applicants will not be called upon to respond
    to the allegations and the Commissioner will disregard the evidence in his
    report.  Moreover, the applicants could seek a ban as to the publication
    of the names of individual officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot accept the respondent’s submission.  Given prior rulings by the Commissioner,
    one of which was affirmed by this court, the prospect of a successful motion
    for a publication ban is doubtful at best.  By succeeding on the appeal,
    the applicants would admittedly take the allegations off the table when it
    comes to the report, but they would also remove any opportunity they might
    have to respond.  To use the vernacular, once the evidence is given, from
    the perspective of the applicants’ reputation, “the horse is out of the barn”.  In
    my view the risk posed by a public one-sided version of this complaint to
    the reputation of the applicants constitutes irreparable harm.  See <i>Gaudet
    v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario (Securities Commission)</i> (1990), 38 O.A.C. 216 (

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the respondent submits that the balance of convenience favours denying a
    stay on the ground that should the appeal fail, the orderly presentation
    of evidence before the commission would be disrupted.  It is further submitted
    that C-12 has already suffered anxiety over the uncertainty as to when she
    is to testify and that granting a stay would occasion her further distress. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the inconvenience to the applicants that would flow from
    denying the stay and having to face serious but unanswered public allegations
    of dereliction of duty outweighs any inconvenience that would flow from the
    need to re-schedule the evidence of C-12 and C-13.  Moreover, the inconvenience
    to the respondent and these witnesses can be mitigated by an order expediting
    the determination of the application for leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not satisfied that the circumstances are so urgent as to require that
    the motion for leave to appeal and the appeal, if leave be granted, should
    be heard together. However, the motion for leave to appeal should be expedited.  The
    applicants are to perfect the application for leave to appeal by October
    11, 2007.  The respondents are to file their responding material by October
    15, 2007, and the applicants to file their reply, if any, by October 17,
    2007.  I direct that the application for leave be placed immediately before
    a panel for disposition. I leave it to the panel dealing with the leave application
    to determine, if leave to appeal is granted, the terms of any further stay
    and the terms, if any, upon which the appeal should be expedited.</p>
