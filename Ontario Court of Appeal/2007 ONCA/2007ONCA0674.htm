style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 20, 2003, a van driven by the appellant, Colleen Morrison (“Morrison”),
    collided with a vehicle driven by Trevor Squance (“Squance”).  Mr. Squance
    was killed.  Ms. Morrison, her two sons, Tylor Gostick (“Tylor”) and Travis
    Gostick (“Travis”) as well as her husband, Allan Ingleson (“Ingleson”) were
    seriously injured.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    vehicle driven by Ms. Morrison was insured under an automobile policy issued
    by the appellant, Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Company of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Royal”).  Mr. Squance was uninsured.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two law suits arising out of the accident.  In one, Mr. Ingleson, as
    litigation guardian for Travis and Tylor, and in his personal capacity, sued
    Mr. Squance, Ms. Morrison, and Royal.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In the other action, Ms. Morrison sued Mr. Squance
    and Royal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the purpose of this proceeding, it is agreed that Mr. Squance was entirely
    responsible for the accident, and that Ms. Morrison was negligent in not
    ensuring that her son, Travis, was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the
    accident.  Ms. Morrison’s negligence contributed to Travis’s injuries. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Royal
    accepts that by virtue of Ms. Morrison’s negligence, it is responsible under
    the liability coverage provisions in its policy for Travis’s damages up to
    the $1,000,000 limit in the policy.  Travis was very badly injured and it
    is assumed  his damages will exceed $1,000,000.  He does not claim any entitlement
    to further recovery from Royal under any other part of the policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Travis
    has no stake in this appeal.  The dispute is between Royal on one side and
    Ms. Morrison and Mr. Ingleson and Tylor on the other.  For ease of reference,
    I will refer to these three individuals collectively as the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents all suffered serious injuries in the car accident.  Mr. Squance
    is the only person who has any liability to the respondents for the damages
    arising out of the accident.  As Mr. Squance is uninsured, the respondents
    have looked to their policy, the Royal policy, for coverage.  Specifically,
    the respondents claimed that they are entitled to recover under the terms
    of the Family Protection Coverage Endorsement (“FPC Endorsement”) attached
    to the Royal policy.  The FPC Endorsement has a $1,000,000 limit.  This amount
    will not cover in full the damages suffered by the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Motions
    were brought in both actions to determine whether the respondents were covered
    under the terms of the FPC Endorsement.  Royal argued that as it was obliged
    to pay Travis $1,000,000 under the liability coverage in its policy, it was
    not obliged under the terms of the FPC Endorsement to make any further payment
    to any of the other family members who suffered damage as the result of the
    negligence of the uninsured driver, Mr. Squance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Royal
    further submitted that any entitlement the respondents had under the policy
    must come under the provisions that address uninsured motorist coverage.  That
    coverage provides for a maximum payout of $200,000.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like
    the motion judge, I disagree with the interpretation of the FPC Endorsement
    advanced by Royal.  On  a plain reading of that Endorsement, the respondents
    are eligible claimants with a claim against Mr. Squance, an inadequately
    insured motorist who is solely responsible for the respondents’ injuries.  As
    Mr. Squance has no insurance, the respondents are entitled to recover from
    Royal up to $1,000,000, the limit of the family protection coverage provided
    for in the FPC Endorsement purchased from Royal by Ms. Morrison.</p>

    automobile liability policies issued in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario must contain uninsured motorist coverage.  That coverage requires
    the insured’s own insurer to provide certain minimum levels of coverage in
    the event that the insured is injured in an accident caused by an uninsured
    motorist:  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 676 as amended O. Reg. 276/03.  </p>

    motorist can, for an additional premium, purchase added coverage for injuries
    caused by underinsured motorists.  This coverage is optional and when purchased
    comes in the form of the FPC Endorsement.  The terms of the Endorsement are
    standardized and approved by the Superintendent of Financial Services.<a

    insured can purchase the level of FPC Endorsement coverage he or she deems
    appropriate.  Where the FPC Endorsement does not set out a specific limit,
    the limit of the coverage provided by the FPC Endorsement is the same as
    the liability limit in the policy.  This policy had a liability limit of
    $1,000,000 and an FPC Endorsement limit of $1,000,000.  Ms. Morrison paid
    $227 for the bodily harm liability coverage in the main policy and an additional
    $11 for the coverage provided by the FPC Endorsement.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretative exercise required in this proceeding focuses on paras. 3 and
    4 of the FPC Endorsement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>3.  In consideration of a premium of $......... or as stated in the Certificate
    of Automobile Insurance to which this change form is attached, the insurer
    shall indemnify an eligible claimant for the amount that he or she is legally
    entitled to recover from an inadequately insured motorist as compensatory
    damages in respect of bodily injury to or death of an insured person arising
    directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>4. The insurer’s maximum liability under this change form, regardless
    of the number of eligible claimants or insured persons injured or killed
    or the number of automobiles insured under the Policy, is the amount by which
    the limit of family protection coverage exceeds the total of all limits of
    motor vehicle liability insurance, or bonds, or cash deposits, or other financial
    guarantees as required by law in lieu of such insurance, of the inadequately
    insured motorist and of any person jointly liable with that motorist.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    3 describes the coverage provided by the FPC Endorsement.  Paragraph 4 fixes
    the monetary limits of Royal’s liability under the FPC Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraphs
    3 and 4 contain several defined terms.  I do not think there is any dispute
    as to the applicability of those terms in this case.  It is accepted that
    the respondents are all
    “eligible claimants” and “insured persons” under the definitions in para.
    1 of the FPC Endorsement.  It is also accepted that Mr. Squance falls within
    the definition of an “inadequately insured motorist” for the purpose of the
    FPC coverage.  Lastly, the parties accept that the “limit of family protection
    coverage”, another defined term, is $1,000,000, the same as the liability
    limit in the main policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would be customary at this juncture of the reasons to set out canons of construction
    governing insurance contracts and insurance related legislation.  Those canons
    are well known and I see no value in rehearsing them here.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretative exercise engaged in this case requires that the words, particularly
    in para. 4 of the FPC Endorsement, be given their plain meaning bearing in
    mind the purpose of the FPC Endorsement.  The FPC Endorsement is intended
    first and foremost to extend coverage beyond the coverage provided for in
    the main policy for bodily injuries suffered by an insured or other eligible
    claimant at the hands of an underinsured motorist:  <i>Taggart (Litigation
    Guardian of)  v. Simmons</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 704 at para. 35 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    FPC Endorsement extends the coverage provided for in the main policy by giving
    the insured the same financial protection the insured would have if the at
    fault driver had insurance in the same amount as the limit of the FPC Endorsement
    purchased by the insured:  <i>Chilton v. Co-Operators General Insurance Co.</i> (1997),
    32 O.R. (3d) 161 at 165 (C.A.).</p>

    the purpose in mind, I turn to the language of paras. 3 and 4.  I have set
    out side by side below para. 3 as it actually appears in the FPC Endorsement
    (on the left), and as it reads stripped to its essential language and tailored

    Royal’s arithmetic, the million dollars in liability insurance available
    to Travis under Ms. Morrison’s Royal policy must be taken into account in
    determining Royal’s maximum liability under the FPC Endorsement.  Royal contends
    that Ms. Morrison is jointly liable with Mr. Squance for the injuries of
    Travis and that for the purpose of para. 4, Travis is an eligible claimant
    and insured as defined in the FPC Endorsement even though he makes no claim
    under that Endorsement.  On Royal’s reading, its maximum liability is $1,000,000
    (the limits of the FCP Endorsement) minus $1,000,000 (the amount of motor
    vehicle liability insurance available to Ms. Morrison, a jointly liable motorist)
    for a net potential liability to Royal under para. 4 of zero.</p>

    respondents’ calculation begins with the same $1,000,000, that is, the limit
    of the FPC Endorsement coverage.  The respondents contend, however, that
    only the amount of Mr. Squance’s liability coverage (zero) and not Ms. Morrison’s
    liability coverage ($1,000,000) should be deducted from the $1,000,000.  The
    respondents argue that Ms. Morrison is not “jointly liable” to the respondents
    and that any liability coverage available to her in respect of Travis’s injuries
    is irrelevant in assessing Royal’s maximum liability under para. 4 to the
    respondents.  The respondents contend that Royal’s maximum liability is $1,000,000
    minus zero for a net amount of $1,000,000.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Royal’s
    approach to para. 4 requires that all insured under the policy who suffered
    bodily harm in the accident be treated as a group for the purpose of considering
    Royal’s maximum liability under para. 4 even if one or more of the insured
    does not seek indemnification under para. 4.  Clearly, para. 4 imposes a
    single limit on the cumulative amount of the claims advanced by different
    insured who suffered injuries in the same accident.  The maximum liability
    under para. 4 applies to the total claims made by the insured and not to
    individual claims.  I cannot find anything, however, in the language of para.
    4 that would require that joint liability to an insured who does not seek
    recovery under para. 4 can serve to reduce the maximum liability of Royal
    to those insured who do seek recovery under para. 4.  </p>

    language of para. 4 reduces what would otherwise be the maximum liability
    under the FPC Endorsement by reference to two things:  first, the liability
    coverage of the underinsured motorist, and second, the liability coverage
    of anyone “jointly liable” with the underinsured motorist.  Joint liability
    refers to responsibility for the injuries suffered by the insured.  There
    is no one jointly liable with Mr. Squance for the damages suffered by the
    respondents.  I agree with the observation of the motion judge at para. 13
    of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… The insuring
    agreement under this endorsement speaks of the obligation to indemnify individual
    claimants.  Consistent with that, claimants must be considered individually
    in determining whether the limit of coverage applies to them.  On that basis,
    the joint liability limitation would not apply to any of the plaintiffs,
    other than Travis, as Ms. Morrison is not jointly liable to them.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Royal’s
    argument essentially comes down to the contention that to the extent that
    the liability provisions of its policy must respond to injuries suffered
    in an accident, that amount must be deducted from the coverage available
    under the FPC Endorsement.  Insurers, who ultimately determine the language
    of the FPC Endorsement, could have written it in that way to specifically
    provide that any recovery made under the liability portion of the policy
    must be taken into account when assessing the insurer’s maximum liability
    under para. 4 of the FPC Endorsement.  The Endorsement is not, however, written
    in those terms.  Instead, the insurers chose to reduce their potential maximum
    liability under the FPC Endorsement by reference to the liability insurance
    coverage available to those responsible for the injuries suffered by the
    insured who are advancing the claim under para. 4.  On the language in para.
    4, the question is not whether Royal’s policy has responded to claims under
    the liability provision in the policy, but whether any insured under the
    Royal policy is jointly liable for the damages suffered by the insureds who
    are seeking coverage under the FPC Endorsement.  On the facts of this case,
    no one insured under the Royal policy is jointly liable to the respondents.  </p>

    submits that the motion judge’s interpretation of the FPC Endorsement is
    inconsistent with the interpretation provided in those cases that have held
    that the FPC Endorsement coverage cannot be stacked on top of liability limits
    under the same policy or another policy:  see <i>Despotopoulos v. Jackson</i>,
    [1991] O.J. No. 1472 (Gen. Div.) aff’d <i>Romas v. Prudential Insurance Co.
    of Canada</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 4185 (C.A.);  <i>Torrance v. Torrance</i>,

    I read those cases, the same claimants sought recovery under the liability
    provisions of a policy and the FPC Endorsement.  Those claimants were in
    the same position that Travis would be in were he to advance a claim under
    the FPC Endorsement for the difference between the $1,000,000 available under
    the liability provision of Royal’s policy and his total in damages.  Travis
    does not, however, seek to “top up”
    the $1,000,000 liability recovery by resort to the FPC Endorsement.  </p>

    Morrison and Mr. Ingleson both filed affidavits on the motion in which they
    set out their understanding of the coverage provided by the FPC Endorsement.  For
    example, Mr. Ingleson’s affidavit reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>4. … Since Colleen
    and I expected to use the van to transport Travis and Tylor on a regular
    basis, we wanted to make sure that we had enough insurance to protect them,
    and ourselves, in the event of an accident with an uninsured or inadequately
    insured vehicle.  That was the reason why we paid an additional premium for
    the Family Protection Coverage endorsement.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.  It was our
    understanding that the purchase of the OPCF 44R Family Protection Coverage
    endorsement would make available the sum of $1,000,000 to respond to claims
    made by all or any of the members of our family for injuries and damages
    caused by a motorist without insurance or with inadequate insurance.  That
    was the whole purpose of our purchasing that additional coverage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Royal
    did not cross-examine on these affidavits.  Counsel for the respondents submitted
    that the unchallenged assertions in the affidavits provided cogent evidence
    of the reasonable expectations of the ordinary purchaser of the FPC Endorsement
    coverage.  Counsel contended that the understanding of Mr. Ingleson and Ms.
    Morrison as to the scope of the coverage should influence both the court’s
    interpretation of the language in the Endorsement and the court’s interpretation
    of the scope of the coverage, regardless of the language used in the Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    can find no evidentiary value in the stated understanding of Ms. Morrison
    and Mr. Ingleson.  There is no suggestion that either were aware of the language
    in the FPC Endorsement, much less that either had examined the language.  There
    is also no suggestion that the understanding of Ms. Morrison and Mr. Ingleson
    as to the scope of the coverage is predicated on any representation made
    to them by Royal.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    insured’s stated belief that his or her claim is covered by the policy is
    hardly surprising and indeed goes without saying.  However, where that belief
    is uninformed by any knowledge of the language of the policy, and unaffected
    by any representation made on behalf of the insurer, that belief cannot assist
    either in interpreting the language of the policy, or in providing a basis
    apart from the language of the policy for recovery from the insurer. </p>
