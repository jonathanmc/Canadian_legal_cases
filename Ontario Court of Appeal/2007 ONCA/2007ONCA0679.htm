    J. ordered that the matter be returned July 13, 2006 on notice to the appellant.
    On that date the matter came on before Croll J. who noted that the appellant
    was seeking legal aid and required a Russian translator. Further, she noted the
    appellant advised his wife’s counsel that he had spent approximately $400,000
    (USD) taken from the Florida bank account which sum included $317,000 (USD) which
    the wife claimed as her own. He refused to disclose how he’d spent the money.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Croll
    J. ordered that the June 29, 2006 order of Jarvis J. with respect to the
    freezing of the appellant’s bank accounts with the exception of one account to
    which the wife did not object be continued. She further ordered the appellant
    to appear for questioning with or without counsel on Friday, August 11, 2006,
    particulars of time and location to be provided by wife’s counsel. The
    appellant was to serve and file a completed financial statement and answer no
    later than August 4, 2006. The appellant was ordered to pay costs of $1000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the appellant failed to comply with the orders of Jarvis J. and Croll J., the
    wife moved for a finding of contempt before Backhouse J. It is the order rendered
    on that occasion which is the subject of the within appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her reasons the motion judge noted the appellant’s failure to comply with
    earlier orders specifically:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he had not provided a full written accounting of
    all funds or assets withdrawn or transferred by him in the 60 days proceeding
    June 29, 2006,</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he had not paid the $317,000 (USD) into court,</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>despite his then counsel’s assurance to his
    wife’s counsel that he was aware of the date, time and place for questioning,
    he failed to attend,</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the financial statement filed did not account
    for the funds taken,</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he did not deny taking the money and says he
    gambled the money away but refused to provide and  verification of the fact, and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he had not paid costs orders made against him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found that the appellant had acted in “flagrant disregard” of
    court orders and that he deliberately and knowingly breached the court’s orders
    beyond a reasonable doubt. Earlier cost sanctions imposed against him were
    similarly ignored.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    suggestion was raised that the finding of contempt may be an interlocutory
    order rather than a final order in which case this court would be without
    jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>    We disagree. This court has consistently
    held that a finding of contempt is a final order. See <i>Bassel’s Lunch Ltd. v. Kick et al.</i>, [1936] O.R. 445; <i>International Beverage Dispenser’s Union
    Local 280 v. Kilgoran Hotels Ltd.(c.o.b. Brunswick Hotel)</i>, [1970] O.J. No.
    389.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>    In our view, the findings of the motion
    judge are amply supported by the record before her and we see no error in her
    finding of contempt against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>    Nor are we persuaded that a sentence of 60
    days is manifestly unfit in the circumstances. The appellant was, as the motion
    judge noted, in flagrant violation of court orders and earlier sanctions
    imposed had been ineffective. In the circumstances a short period of
    incarceration was required.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>    Finally, we note that the appellant is
    currently on parole as a result of a further order made by Backhouse J. on
    April 26, 2007 since she found he was still in contempt of the order of Jarvis
    J. The appellant has not appealed that order and so its validity was not in
    issue on this appeal. If he wishes to appeal that order, he should take steps
    immediately to do so. We would hope that Legal Aid Ontario would be able to
    assist him in that respect given that he has difficulty with the English language.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>    The appeal is dismissed.</p>
