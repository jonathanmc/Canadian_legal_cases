    Ontario’s
    “no-fault” insurance regime permits a tort action for recovery of property

    the individual plaintiff and his subrogated insurer to maintain their tort
    action in negligence against the appellants on the basis that the property
    damage payments that the insurer paid to the insured were not made under
    s. 263 of the<i> Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  In my view, <i>Tuttle</i> is

    brought a motion under Rule 21 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, for an order that s. 263 did not bar their action and for

    263 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> replaced the tort system that resolved automobile
    damage claims prior to its enactment.  In the new statutory scheme, insureds
    can no longer sue the tortfeasor driver whose negligence has caused damage
    to their cars.  Rather, their own liability insurer pays for the damage,
    to the extent that they were not at fault, under the third party liability
    section of their motor vehicle liability policies.  Insureds can recover
    the at-fault portion of their damage by purchasing collision coverage.  Insurers
    have no right of subrogation for payments to their own insureds, but, on
    the other hand, do not have to pay the subrogated claims previously brought
    by other insurers in the tort system.  The result is that the statutory regime
    eliminates the transactions costs that were inherent in the tort system.</p>

  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Decision of the Motion Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge began by recognizing that s. 263 of the<i> Insurance Act</i> establishes
    a regime for the payment of compensation for automobile damage claims.  However,
    relying on this court’s decision in <i>Tuttle</i>, she concluded that the
    s. 263 regime did not apply to prevent the plaintiffs from proceeding with
    their claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Tuttle</i>,
    the damaged vehicle, also a truck, was insured under two policies: a collision
    insurance policy issued by The Associates Insurance Co., an American insurance
    company that was not licensed to undertake automobile insurance in Ontario
    and that had not filed an undertaking pursuant to s. 263, and a motor vehicle
    liability policy also issued in the United States by The Travelers Indemnity
    Company, an insurance company that had filed an undertaking to be bound by
    s. 263.  The accident was entirely the fault of the driver of the other vehicle.  The
    collision insurer paid Mr. Tuttle for his property damage and then brought
    a subrogated claim against Mr. Tuttle’s liability insurer.  This court in <i>Tuttle</i> decided
    that this claim was not barred by s. 263(5)(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge understood this court’s decision in <i>Tuttle</i> to be based
    on a reading of s. 263(5)(b) alone, and particularly on the fact that the
    insurer’s payment to its insured was not made “under this section”.  She
    quoted and relied upon the following comment Laskin J.A. made at paragraph
    3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 263(5)
    only applies if the insurer paid for the damage to its insured’s automobile
    under a motor vehicle liability policy.  Because the Associates policy is
    not a motor vehicle liability policy, s. 263 does not apply to it and Associates
    is therefore not precluded from exercising its rights of subrogation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did note that one of the purposes of the s. 263 regime is to
    prevent actions in negligence for property damage to automobiles, but she
    considered herself bound by this court’s decision in <i>Tuttle</i>.  Therefore,
    because Clarendon had not paid for the damage to Mr. Bounthai’s vehicle under
    s. 263, she concluded that the plaintiffs were not barred by s. 263 from
    pursuing their claim against the defendants.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Discussion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    questions arise in this appeal.  First, is the individual plaintiff entitled
    to maintain a tort action in negligence against the individual tortfeasors?  Second,
    does the insurer have a subrogated claim against the individual tortfeasors?  As
    will be seen the first question determines the second.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Can the individual plaintiff maintain
    a tort action in negligence against the individual tortfeasors?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, Mr. Bounthai’s liability insurer, American Home, was statutorily
    required to provide coverage for his property damage because it had filed
    an undertaking under s. 226.1.  Because the undertaking was filed, all three
    criteria of s. 263(1) are met:  Mr. Bounthai’s vehicle suffered damage from
    an accident in Ontario, his vehicle was insured by an insurer that had filed
    an undertaking with the Superintendent, and another vehicle involved in the
    accident (i.e. the appellants’) was insured by a domestic insurer licensed
    to undertake automobile insurance in Ontario.  Consequently, Mr. Bounthai
    is entitled to recover for the physical damage to his tractor from his liability
    insurer, American Home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the statutory regime applies, Mr. Bounthai’s ability to sue in tort is restricted
    by the provisions of s. 263.  Mr. Bounthai cannot maintain a tort action
    in negligence against the Candows.  Section 263(5)(a) prevents him from suing
    anyone other than his own insurer for damages to his car.  Sections 263(5)(a)’s
    general rule is subject to the exception set out in s. 263(5)(a.1). This
    exception permits a right of action where an action is brought “<i>under
    an agreement, other than a contract of automobile insurance</i>”.  It permits
    an action in contract and does not permit an action in tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exception would apply, for example, where a provision of a lease agreement
    requires that the lessee return the vehicle to the lessor in an undamaged
    state.  Where the lessee fails to do so, the lessor can bring an action against
    the lessee in contract: <i>583809 Ontario Ltd. v. Kay</i> (1995), 24 O.R.
    (3d) 445 (Gen. Div.), <i>A Plus Car &amp; Truck Rental v. Pun</i>, [1999]
    O.J. No. 1291 (
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.).  The exception in s. 263(5)(a.1) has been applied also to situations
    where the defendant has agreed to pay for the damage to the plaintiff’s vehicle
    without the parties resorting to their insurance –
    in effect a claim on an oral contract.  In <i>Harpeet v. Markham (Town of)</i>,
    [2006] O.J. No. 2439 (S.C.J.), P. Gollom Deputy J. observed at para. 17 that
    the exception in 263(5)(a.1) “expands causes of action against a person involved
    in the incident provided the person has entered into a contract, and the
    person is at fault or negligent.” <i>McClinton v. Estien</i>, [2003] O.J.
    No. 5680 (S.C.J.), is another such case.</p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, however, Mr. Bounthai’s action is not brought “under an agreement”.   Mr.
    Bounthai’s claim is a tort claim that falls within the general rule of s.
    263(5) so it is statutorily barred.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Does the insurer have a subrogated claim
    against the individual tortfeasors?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    insurer’s right to bring a subrogated action is dependent on the existence
    of a cause of action by the insured.  This is so both under the common law
    and under the statute.  Justice Sharpe explained the common law principle
    in <i>McCourt Cartage Ltd. v. Fleming Estate</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 795
    at 799 (Gen. Div.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If the insured
    has no right of action, then the foundation of the insurer’s right to bring
    a subrogated action is removed.  It is clear that at common law, an insurer’s
    right to bring a subrogated action is derivative of and dependent upon the
    existence of a cause of action by the insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Insurance
      Act</i> is entirely consistent with this common-law principle by providing
      an insurer is subrogated “to all rights of recovery of the insured”.  Section
      278 (1) of the Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>An insurer who
    makes any payment or assumes liability therefore under a contract is subrogated
    to all rights of recovery of the insured against any person and may bring
    an action in the name of the insured to enforce those rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    263(5)(b) does not disturb this common-law and statutory principle.  The
    import of s. 263(5)(b) is to eliminate any rights of subrogation an insurer
    may have for payments it has statutorily been compelled to make to the insured “under
    this section”.  Where the insurer has made the payment other than “under
    this section”, the insurer is subrogated to whatever rights of recovery that
    the insured has otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since,
    as discussed above, s. 263(5)(a) extinguishes an insured’s right to recover
    property damage from a tortfeasor, his or her insurer cannot have a subrogated
    right to recover property damage from a tortfeasor.  Therefore, Clarendon
    has no right to bring a subrogated tort claim in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge, following <i>Tuttle</i>, resisted this conclusion. In particular,
    she relied on Laskin J.A.’s comment quote above that “Because the Associates
    policy is not a motor vehicle liability policy, s. 263 does not apply to
    it and Associates is therefore not precluded from exercising its rights of
    subrogation.” This observation, however, must be read as applying to the
    particular facts before the court in <i>Tuttle</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts in <i>Tuttle w</i>ere different because it did not involve a tort claim,
    but rather an action by one insurance company against another, and his property
    damage insurer had existing subrogation rights.  Mr. Tuttle was entitled
    to recover his property damage from his liability insurer, which had filed
    an undertaking to be bound by s. 263, under s. 263(2).  His property damage
    insurer, which had not filed an undertaking, had paid for the damage and
    brought an action against the liability insurer for payments it had made.  As
    Mr. Tuttle, personally, had a right of recovery against his liability insurer,
    his property damage insurer was subrogated to that right of recovery under
    s. 278(1) and could bring an action in his name to enforce that right.  The
    property damage insurer’s right to bring a subrogated claim was not extinguished
    by s. 263(b) because the payment it made was not “under this section”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    263(5)(b) is not a provision that creates rights where they do not already
    exist.  Rather it is a provision that eliminates rights.  The fact it eliminates
    the subrogation rights of an insurer that makes payments to its insured “under
    this section” does not mean an insurer that made payments not “under this
    section” has subrogation rights.  The subrogation rights of such an insurer
    must exist otherwise, as they did in <i>Tuttle</i>, in order for an action
    for reimbursement of the payment to proceed.  </p>
