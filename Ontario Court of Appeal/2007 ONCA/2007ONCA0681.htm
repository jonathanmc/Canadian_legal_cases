  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Marlon Maragh, appeals from his convictions for eight offences – attempted
    murder, aggravated assault, use of a firearm, two counts of possession of
    a firearm while prohibited, and three counts of failure to stop for police
    causing bodily harm.  The convictions were the result of a 48 day jury trial
    presided over by Glass J. in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Whitby.  The appellant also appeals his sentence of 18 years (12 years, 8
    months in addition to 32 months pre-trial, credited on a 2 for 1 basis).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case arose from a shooting during a pick-up basketball game in a high school
    gymnasium.  Following a confrontation on the court involving Tyshan Riley,
    the appellant’s friend, and Teran Richards, Richards was shot four times
    in the chest.  A fifth bullet missed Richards and grazed the cheek of a 13
    year old spectator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the shooting, many people, including the appellant, left the gym.  Police
    chased a car containing the appellant, Riley and perhaps one other person.  While
    the getaway car was stopped at a crossing waiting for a train to pass, police
    directed the occupants to exit the car.  Instead, they sped off after the
    train had passed.  Soon after, the car went out of control and flipped, hitting
    another vehicle and injuring a father and his two sons.  Police chased the
    appellant into the woods.  He was bitten by a police dog and arrested.  Police
    recovered two guns from the crash site, including the gun that was determined
    to have been used in the gym shooting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    his arrest, the appellant boasted to Bryan Johnston, a cellmate in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Whitby jail, that he had shot Richards.  He described to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Johnston the events that followed the shootings, in some cases exaggerating
    what was later established to have occurred.  The appellant also admitted
    to shooting Richards to Constable Duraiappah, an undercover police officer
    with whom he shared a holding cell, and told Duraiappah a similar story about
    the events that followed the shooting.  The appellant told Duraiappah he
    owned the .357 magnum that police recovered from near the place where the
    car crashed.  He bragged to Duraiappah that he would shoot Richards if ever
    he saw him again.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified at trial that he did not shoot Richards.  He said that
    the real shooter was a man known as “Razor”, for whom the appellant had sold
    drugs in the past and with whom he’d been watching the game.  He said that
    after the shooting Razor went to the appellant’s car and forced him to drive
    quickly so as to evade the police.  He said that the .357 magnum recovered
    near the crash site belonged to Razor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant bragged about being the shooter to Johnston and Duraiappah,
    he never mentioned Razor and said that there were only two people in the
    getaway car – himself and Riley. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Johnston testified that when the appellant told him this, he suggested that
    the appellant invent a third occupant of the car and refer to that occupant
    as
    “Joker”.  Apart from the appellant, no one at trial mentioned Razor, and
    the appellant admitted to not knowing Razor’s phone number, address, or first
    or last name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he was lying when he told the undercover police
    officer that he was the shooter.  He claimed he was trying to puff up what
    he had done.  He also said he was lying when he confessed to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Johnston.  He said he was a 130 lb. black man in a row with many white bikers
    and that he was intimidated by his biker cellmate who was 6' 8&quot; and
    500 lbs., so he lied to protect himself.</p>
  <h3>Conviction Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred by refusing to allow the appellant
    to call expert evidence relating to police procedures with respect to identification
    evidence obtained by photo line-ups.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge carefully applied the factors from <i>R. v. Mohan </i>(1994),
    89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.).  We cannot fault his conclusion that expert
    testimony was not necessary because “[t]here can be no doubt that the jury
    would understand that there is a weakness to the procedures followed by the
    officers and that they would appreciate that eyewitnesses miss a lot and
    make mistakes.”  Moreover, the trial judge gave a comprehensive instruction
    to the jury on these points.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the in-dock identification of Grant Malcolm was inadmissible.  We
    disagree.  The evidence was useful, if only marginally, to provide context
    for the defence’s argument that Malcolm’s failure to identify the appellant
    during the photo line-up proved the appellant’s innocence.  Moreover, the
    trial judge properly and repeatedly instructed the jury about the limited
    value of in-dock identifications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s charge on identification evidence
    generally was insufficient.  In particular, the appellant contends that the
    trial judge was required to instruct the jury about the confidence level
    of identification witnesses and the danger of eyewitnesses conflating the
    shooter and another spectator at the basketball game.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge’s instruction conformed with the model jury charge
    with respect to identification evidence.  The trial judge carefully explained
    all of the identification evidence and provided the appropriate cautions.  Those
    cautions covered the two issues raised by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred by preventing the appellant
    from introducing, through the witness Johnston, his prior statements to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Johnston and the police undercover officer that he was the shooter.  The
    trial judge ruled that, in the absence of testimony from the appellant, there
    was no evidence of recent fabrication or the appellant’s state of mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    it turned out, the appellant did testify (as he had always planned) that
    he said things in the jail cell that were lies because he was scared of Johnston
    and wanted to impress the posing undercover officer.  The trial judge then
    allowed the appellant to call
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Johnston as a witness and allowed the appellant to be recalled to give him
    the opportunity to comment on
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Johnston’s testimony.  Accordingly, no prejudice flowed from the trial judge’s
    initial ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the jury should have received a limiting instruction
    telling them that they could not use the evidence of the appellant’s conversations
    in the holding cell with an undercover police officer (threatening to “blow
    off” the complainant’s head if he came to court, bragging about his expertise
    with handguns, explaining how he wanted to maim the police dog) as an indication
    that the appellant was more likely to have committed the crimes with which
    he had been charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The defence made no complaint about this component of the jury
    charge.  Moreover, the central issue in this domain was whether the jury
    would accept the appellant’s testimony that he lied in his jailhouse conversations
    with the undercover officer and a fellow inmate.  The specific statements
    set out above were simply components of this principal issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred by allowing each juror to receive
    a copy of the cell probe transcript for use during jury deliberations because
    the transcript contained words filling in where the tape was inaudible.  We
    disagree.  The trial judge was entitled to determine what would provide appropriate
    assistance to the jury in their deliberations.  The added portions were clearly
    identified in the transcript and the trial judge repeatedly instructed the
    jury that only the audiotape was evidence they could use.</p>
  <h3>Sentence appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the 18 year sentence was excessive and did not reflect
    the fact that the appellant was only 21 years old at that time of the shooting,
    that this was his first penitentiary sentence, that the victim did not suffer
    permanent debilitating injuries, and that there was no planning or premeditation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  A young man was shot four times in a crowded school gymnasium.  A
    13 year old girl was also hit by a bullet.  The appellant had a lengthy criminal
    record.  He was subject to a weapons prohibition at the time.  The car chase
    showed no respect for police officers or innocent bystanders.  The sentence
    was manifestly fit.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted and
    the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
