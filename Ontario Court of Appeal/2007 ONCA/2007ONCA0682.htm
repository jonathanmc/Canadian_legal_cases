  <p class=MsoHeading7>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p>[1]       In November 2004, Jennifer Hill worked as a Band representative
    and service co-coordinator for Six Nations Child and Family Services.  She
    was the Band representative responsible for the Children’s Aid Society case
    involving the children of Patrick Holley.  </p>
  <p>[2]       Jennifer Hill by chance, met Patrick Holley at a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford courthouse on the morning of November 26, 2004.  During a conversation
    in an interview room at the courthouse, Patrick Holley threatened to kill
    or injure several persons whom he identified.  Each person was associated
    with law enforcement or the administration of justice in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Brantford area.</p>
  <p>[3]       Patrick Holley denied meeting Jennifer Hill at the courthouse
    on the morning of November 26, 2004 and threatening to kill or harm anyone
    as she claimed.  Mr. Holley and several witnesses said that he was at his
    lawyer’s office preparing material for an upcoming legal proceeding when,
    according to Ms. Hill, they spoke in the courthouse interview room.  </p>
  <p>[4]       The trial judge accepted the evidence of Jennifer Hill about the
    events of the morning of November 26, 2004 and specifically rejected Patrick
    Holley’s denial and claim that he was elsewhere at the material time.  After
    entering a finding of guilt and conviction, the trial judge sentenced Patrick
    Holley to imprisonment for a term of sixty (60) days to be followed by probation
    for two (2) years.  </p>
  <p>[5]       Patrick Holley appeals both conviction for threatening contrary
    to s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and sentence.  </p>

'>THE FACTS</span></h6>
  <h3>1      Introduction </h3>
  <p>[6]       For all practical purposes, the case for the prosecution depended
    upon the evidence of Jennifer Hill.  Some confirmatory evidence about events
    that followed her meeting with Patrick Holley made its way into trial proceedings,
    but proof of the essential elements of the offence and Patrick Holley’s participation
    in it depended entirely on her testimony.  </p>
  <p>[7]       Patrick Holley’s response to the allegations contained in the
    information was an unqualified denial.  He and several other witnesses accounted
    for his whereabouts and activities at various times throughout the day.  He
    acknowledged meeting Ms. Hill by chance later in the day, but denied saying
    anything of the kind she claimed he had uttered earlier.  And the scent of
    a malevolent conspiracy permeated the prosecution, according to Mr. Holley. </p>
  <h3>2        The Prosecution’s Case </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[8]       Jennifer Hill was late arriving for a family law proceeding in a
      second floor courtroom at a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford courthouse on November 26, 2004.  The matter for which she had
    attended had already been adjourned.  The courthouse was not busy.  After
    a brief wait, Ms. Hill walked downstairs.  She stopped to look at the list
    on the wall outside another courtroom.  There she ran into Patrick Holley
    who was looking for his lawyer, Mr. Karkkainen.  Mr. Holley’s case was not
    on the court list that day. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[9]       Patrick Holley asked Ms. Hill whether she had a few minutes to talk
      about his case.  She agreed.  They went into an interview room.  Holley
      recounted some concerns he had about his case.  In time, as his narrative
      continued, Holley became agitated and angry, recounting an endless stream
      of official wrong-doing and missteps in connection with his file.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[10]     As Patrick Holley continued his rant about the wrongs he had suffered,
      he threatened to torture his tormentors by pouring boiling grease over
      their heads in front of their children.  He recited the names of several
      Children’s Aid workers and police officers on the Six Nations reserve,
      and mentioned a Hells Angels member from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Detroit, a man whose last name was “Lewis”, as someone who could help him
    in his pursuit. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[11]     Patrick Holley mentioned that his mother was waiting outside the courthouse
      for him.  When Ms. Hill and Holley parted company, Ms. Hill walked upstairs
      passing by two local lawyers, Joy Marr and Elizabeth Porter, on her way.  Patrick
      Holley headed for the front doors of the courthouse.  Ms. Hill, upset and
      somewhat afraid, recruited a court officer to escort her to her car.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[12]     Jennifer Hill established the time of the conversation with Patrick
      Holley as sometime between 11:00 and 11:44 a.m. on November 26, 2004.  She
      noticed the clock in her car read 11:44 when she returned there with the
      security officer.  When her supervisor returned from lunch, she reported
      the incident to him, then to the Six Nations and finally to the Brantford
      Police Service.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[13]     In cross-examination, Jennifer Hill agreed that she had not told investigators
      about going downstairs at the courthouse before meeting Mr. Holley near
      where a court list was posted.  She had said that she had met him as she
      came out of a courtroom on the second floor.  Ms. Hill met her supervisor
      at about 12:30 p.m., then drove to the Six Nations police station where
      she made a complaint between 1:00 and 1:30 p.m.  She left there around
      2:00 p.m.   Ms. Hill did not see Patrick Holley after their chance meeting
      of the morning.  She spoke with investigators from the Brantford Police
      Service at around 5:00 p.m. on the same afternoon.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[14]     John Wilkinson, a court constable employed by the Brantford Police
      Service, was at work in a second floor courtroom at the courthouse on November
      26, 2004.  He was approached by a woman who was concerned for her safety
      and escorted her to her car.  He could not recall her name but she (Ms.
      Hill) identified him by sight and voice on January 11, 2005.  He did recall
      escorting somebody out of the courtroom during the Fall of 2004.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[15]     Barbra Holley is Patrick Holley’s mother.  She and her son left their
      Cayuga residence at 9:30 a.m. on November 26, 2004 to drive to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford where Patrick Holley had an appointment with his lawyer.  Mrs.
    Holley dropped Patrick off at Mr. Karkkainen’s office at about 10:15 a.m.
    and Mrs. Holley waited in her car, which she parked directly in front of
    the lawyer’s office.  She stayed outside the office until about 11:30 a.m. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[16]     Barbra Holley took Patrick to the courthouse around 3:00 p.m. on November
      26, 2004 and waited for him for about 15 minutes.  When Patrick returned,
      he was happy.  He said he had spoken to Jennifer Hill.  It was about 3:15
      p.m.  The purpose of the courthouse visit was for Patrick to do “something
      about private information” and to deliver some reports to Mr. Karkkainen
      for some family law proceedings that would later take place.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[17]     In cross-examination, Mrs. Holley recalled that Mark Karkkainen came
      out of his office at about 11:30 a.m. to advise her that she could return
      at 1:30 p.m.   She returned at 1:15 p.m.  Patrick Holley joined her between
      1:15 and 1:30 p.m. and they went out for lunch. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[18]     Elizabeth Porter, a lawyer in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford, was at the courthouse on November 26, 2004.  She thought she completed
    her obligations in family court by 11:30 a.m. or noon on that day.  She could
    not recall having seen Patrick Holley on that day, although she frequently
    saw him at the courthouse.  She was not asked whether she had seen Jennifer
    Hill.  </span></p>
  <h3>3      The Defence Case</h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[19]     Patrick Holley testified that he and Dr. Tobey plinked some gas lines
      in the building where they lived before Mr. Holley’s mother, Barbra, picked
      him up at 9:30 a.m. to drive him to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford to meet his lawyer, Mark Karkkainen.  Mr. Holley arrived at the
    law office at around 10:15 a.m.  He talked to Mr. Karkkainen’s spouse and
    secretary, Marianne, as well as some other people in the office, for about
    one-half hour.  Mark Karkkainen returned from Superior Court at about 10:45
    a.m.  </span></p>
  <p>[20]     According to the appellant, he and Mark Karkkainen then prepared
    some materials, including affidavits and information for use in the family
    court proceeding to be heard on the following Monday.  He and Mr. Karkkainen
    went to the courthouse to file the documents around noon and remained there
    for about 5 or 10 minutes before going to Tim Horton’s for coffee.  Mr. Holley
    did not see Jennifer Hill at the courthouse that morning.  </p>
  <p>[21]     In answer to leading questions asked by his own counsel, Patrick
    Holley confirmed that</p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>from
    10:15 a.m. until 1:15 p.m. he was with Mr. Karkkainen and/or his wife; and </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>between
    11:00 a.m. and noon he was not in the courthouse.  </p>
  <p>At 1:15 p.m., Mr. Holley met his mother at his lawyer’s office and they
    went out for lunch. </p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[22]     Patrick Holley also pointed out that after he had been charged with
      threatening, he laid a private information charging Jennifer Hill with
      public mischief.  Several months later, in October 2005, he filed a Statement
      of Claim against several defendants including the complainant, the prosecutor,
      and the Children’s Aid Society involved in proceedings relating to his
      children.  The prosecutor later intervened in the private prosecution of
      Ms. Hill and withdrew the charge.  </span></p>
  <p>[23]     In cross-examination, Patrick Holley acknowledged that he had several
    outstanding proceedings relating to his children and their custody.  He considered
    the Six Nations Children’s Aid Society as being very corrupt and complained
    of mistreatment by the Six Nations Police Service.  </p>
  <p>[24]     In cross-examination, Patrick Holley recalled a chance meeting
    with Jennifer Hill around 3:00 p.m. on November 26, 2004.  He described what
    happened in these terms:  </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I went in to get a couple of your private information
    sheets to be, to return to court on Tuesday with, to lay some private charges.  And
    I saw Jennifer Hill there.  And she was walking around in there and she said,
    Hey Pat, and I said, What?  And she said, I can I speak with you?  And I
    said, Sure.  We were standing right in front of the glass door going into
    the court clerk’s office.  She says, You know I met with the CAS.  I said,
    Oh yeah, that’s good; And I was there when the children disclosure, I said,
    Yes.  And she said, I’m doing up with affidavit, she said, Things are going
    to change, don’t worry.  She said, I’ve gotten an idea of what going on here,
    and she said, I’ve gone to my supervisor and, and you’re going to be really
    surprised with what going to happen Monday. </p>
  <p>[25]     Patrick Holley has prior convictions for public mischief and fraud.  </p>
  <p>[26]     Dr. John Tobey, a minister and lecturer at a local college, confirmed
    that Patrick Holley helped him to install a new furnace at a residence where
    Dr. Tobey lived with Mr. Holley and Holley’s mother on November 26, 2004.  Patrick
    Holley and his mother left Cayuga at about 9:30 a.m. on November 26, 2004.  </p>
  <p>[27]     Mark Karkkainen represents Patrick Holley in various family law
    proceedings.  He met Mr. Holley at his office at about 10:45 a.m. on November
    26, 2004, after Mr. Karkkainen had returned from an appearance in the Superior
    Court.  Mr. Karkkainen spoke to Barbra Holley shortly after he returned to
    the office to tell her that he and her son would be occupied for a couple
    of hours in preparing materials for a future court appearance.  </p>
  <p>[28]     Patrick Holley and Mark Karkkainen went over to the courthouse
    around noon or 12:15 p.m. to file their materials, then headed off to Tim
    Horton’s for coffee and a sandwich.  Mr. Karkkainen did not see Jennifer
    Hill at the courthouse.  He agreed that it would not have been possible for
    Patrick Holley to have come to the courthouse alone and met Ms. Hill at any
    time between 10:00 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. on November 26, 2004.  </p>
  <p>[29]     In cross-examination, Mr. Karkkainen gave evidence that he had
    no contact with Patrick Holley around 3:15 p.m. on November 26, 2004.  Materials
    for the application to be heard on the following Monday had to be filed before
    2:00 p.m. on the preceding Friday.  </p>
  <p>[30]     Marianne Karkkainen, the spouse and secretary of Mark Karkkainen,
    recalled that she dropped her husband off at the Superior Court at or shortly
    after 10:00 a.m. on November 26, 2004.  Patrick Holley was at the law office
    when she returned between 10:10 and 10:15 a.m.  Mark Karkkainen returned
    to the office at around 10:45 a.m. and worked together with Patrick Holley
    until both men left the office at around noon for lunch.  She did not see
    Patrick Holley again that day.  </p>
  <p>[31]     Detective Donald Pancoe of the Brantford Police Service testified
    that he had been provided with affidavits from Mark and Marianne Karkkainen
    describing their contact with Patrick Holley on November 26, 2004.  The officer
    did not interview either affiant because he considered the contents of the
    affidavits to be at odds with evidence given at Patrick Holley’s judicial
    interim release hearing.  </p>
  <p>[32]     Detective Pancoe first interviewed Jennifer Hill on November 26,
    2004 at around 5:15 p.m.  She told him that the meeting with Patrick Holley
    had taken place on the second floor of the courthouse.  He interviewed her
    again on December 11, 2004, about two weeks before he received the Karkkainen
    affidavits. </p>

'>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE </span></h6>
  <h3>1.      Introduction </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[33]     Some references to the reasons of the learned trial judge are essential
      to an understanding of the grounds of appeal and their determination.  </span></p>
  <p>[34]     The reasons were delivered about two months after the evidence
    was adduced and submissions made.  </p>
  <h3>2.      The Preliminaries </h3>
  <p>[35]     After a brief review of the procedural history of the prosecution,
    the learned trial judge rehearsed several principles that informed his decision.  These
    principles included, but were not limited to the following:</p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    presumption of innocence; </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    burden and standard of proof; </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    inapplicability of the standard of proof to individual items of evidence,
    rather its applicability to the evidence as a whole; </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    sources of reasonable doubt in evidence or lack of evidence; </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    prohibition against decisions made simply by choosing witnesses; and </p>
  <p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    principles in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397</p>
  <h3>3.      The Evidentiary Review </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[36]       The learned trial judge then turned to the evidence adduced at trial,
      which he reviewed witness-by-witness without comment or factual finding.  </span></p>
  <h3>4.      Analysis of Law and Facts</h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[37]       In the third part of his reasons, Analysis of Law and Facts, the
      trial judge recorded his findings of fact.  In essence, he found that the
      events occurred as Jennifer Hill had described them and during the morning
      of November 26, 2004.  He specifically rejected the evidence of Patrick
      Holley and, in particular, his account, which only emerged in cross-examination,
      of a friendly chance meeting with Ms. Hill during the afternoon of November
      26, 2004.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[38]       Of some importance because of the grounds of appeal advanced is
      the learned trial judge’s treatment of the evidence of Mark Karkkainen
      and his spouse, Marianne Karkkainen.  The following passages reflect his
      consideration of their evidence:  </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied as well that about 11:30 a.m., Mr. Karkkainen advised Ms. Holley
    who remained in her vehicle outside the office that he would be longer than
    expected with Mr. Holley and that she was free to leave.  Mr. Karkkainen
    says he arrived back at the office at about 10:45 and had that discussion
    with Mrs. Holley about a half an hour later.  Mr. Karkkainen’s timing would
    put that conversation at 11:15; Mr. Holley puts it at 11:30, just another
    indication as to how witnesses can often be mistaken as to precise time when
    recalling events.  I am satisfied that Ms. Holley did leave, and did not
    meet with her son until about 1:15 p.m. I am also satisfied that she was
    not in a position to know exactly all of the movements of her son between
    the time of their arrival in Brantford, and the time she initially left the
    outside of Mr. Karkkainen’s office at 11:30.  Further, she has no personal
    knowledge of the whereabouts of her son from 11:30 a.m. until 1:15 p.m.  </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    and Mrs. Karkkainen gave evidence.  As with other evidence provided by the
    defence, their evidence in many ways enhances the testimony of Ms. Hill.  I
    am not suggesting in any way that Mr. Karkkainen has misled the court with
    respect to the timing, but there is enough uncertainty in the presentation
    of his evidence with respect to his attendance with Mr. Holley at the courthouse
    at or about noon, that it is quite possible that he was not always with him
    at the courthouse if, in fact, the meeting with Ms. Hill took place while
    Mr. Karkkainen was in the courthouse.  Mr. Karkkainen himself indicates that
    there was to be a Superior Court matter that morning and that was to be adjourned
    at the last moment, and that he had attempted to contact Mr. Holley to advise
    that they would not meet at Superior Court.  He confirms then that there
    was to be a meeting a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Superior Court and that the meeting had now been changed to his office.  It
    is more than a coincidence that Ms. Hill testifies to that very meeting at
    Mr. Karkkainen’s office or at the Superior Court on the morning of November
    26th.  That information could only have come from Mr. Holley.  Again, Mr.
    Karkkainen’s evidence with respect to timing is not as solid as one might
    believe given his estimation of time from his arrival back at the office
    until one half hour later when he told Mrs. Holley that they would be longer
    than expected.  The fact that Ms. Hill was supplied with that information
    about the meeting at the courthouse, or the meeting at Superior Court or
    at Mr. Karkkainen’s office, and the fact that she was supplied that information
    I find by Mr. Holley, and that information was in fact confirmed by Mr. Karkkainen,
    clearly supports the position that she indeed did meet Mr. Holley on November
    26th. </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Karkkainen indicates that Mr. Holley came to the office at 10:00 to 10:15
    on the morning of November 26th, and Mr. Karkkainen returned at about 10:45.  This
    may be accurate, but I find that her evidence with respect to whether or
    not Mr. Holley left the office during that period of time he was waiting
    for Mr. Karkkainen to return is not reliable.  This is not say again, that
    she is fabricating her evidence, but in light of all he other circumstances,
    I find that she is in error and I find that Mr. Holley could very well have
    left the office at that time and gone looking for Mr. Karkkainen as suggested
    in the evidence of Ms. Hill and then returned to the office. </p>

'>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL </span></h6>
  <h3>1.      Introduction </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>[39]     Patrick Holley appeals both conviction and sentence.  He alleges judicial
      error in the trial judge’s approach to the evidence and in the conclusion
      reached about its cumulative effect.  He also asserts that the sentence
      imposed was harsh and excessive in the circumstances.  </span></p>
  <h3>2.      The Appeal Against Conviction </h3>
  <p>[40]     On the appeal from conviction, Mr. Paquette for the appellant advances

  <h3>3.         The Appeal From Sentence </h3>
  <p>[41]       In general terms, the appellant’s complaint about the sentence
    imposed is that it was harsh and excessive.  The sentencing judge, the appellant
    says, erred in principle in concluding that this was not a case for conditional
    sentence, or in the alternative, if incarceration was warranted, not a case
    for a sentence that would permit the appellant to serve it intermittently.  And
    besides, the trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant’s
    aboriginal status when determining the nature and length of the sentence
    to be imposed. </p>

'>ANALYSIS </span></h6>
  <h3>1.   The Appeal Against Conviction </h3>
  <h3>              a.       Overview </h3>
  <p>[42]       For discussion purposes, it is helpful to summarize the grounds
    of appeal against conviction as follows:</p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the W.(D.) error; </p>

    unreasonableness of the verdict</p>
  <h3>                b.     The <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> Error </h3>
  <p>[43]       The decision in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 prohibited
    the trial judge from treating the standard of proof as a comparison between
    the prosecution’s witnesses, essentially Jennifer Hill, on the one hand,
    and the appellant and his witnesses, on the other.  The trial judge was not
    entitled to find the guilt of the appellant established on the basis that
    he preferred the evidence of Jennifer Hill over that of the appellant and
    his witnesses. </p>
  <p>[44]       Patrick Holley was entitled to an acquittal if the trial judge
    believed Holley’s claim that he did not utter the threats charged.  Likewise,
    Patrick Holley was entitled to an acquittal, even if the trial judge did
    not believe Holley’s denial, if the trial judge harboured a reasonable doubt
    of Patrick Holley’s guilt after considering the defence evidence in the context
    of the evidence as a whole.  Even if the trial judge did not have a reasonable
    doubt of Patrick Holley’s guilt based on the defence evidence, the trial
    judge was only entitled to find Patrick Holley guilty if the evidence the
    judge accepted satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt of Holley’s guilt.   See, <i>R.
    v. W.(D.)</i>, above, at page 758 per Cory J.  </p>
  <p>[45]       The learned trial judge expressly instructed himself on the principles
    articulated in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, and other relevant principles that establish
    the onus and standard of proof required in criminal cases.  The essence of
    the complaint, at least as it seems to me, is that he erred in their application
    to the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p>[46]       The trial judge said that the evidence of Jennifer Hill satisfied
    him “well beyond a reasonable doubt” of Patrick Holley’s guilt.  He expressly
    rejected Holley’s evidence.  The trial judge did not believe Patrick Holley’s
    evidence, nor did it raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.  The trial
    judge found:  </p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
      do not accept and specifically reject the evidence of Mr. Holley in that
      regard.  Not only do I not accept the evidence of Mr. Holley, I am not
      left in a reasonable doubt by it. </span></p>
  <p>[47]       The trial judge considered the remainder of the evidence and
    concluded:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I indicated previously, the evidence of Mr.
    Holley is not accepted by the court, and the evidence of the defence, including
    the evidence of Mr. Holley does not leave the court in reasonable doubt.  Mr.
    Holley’s evidence is specifically rejected.  Upon rejecting the evidence
    of Mr. Holley and not being left in reasonable doubt by the evidence of the
    defence in general, the court must still assess that balance of the evidence
    and determine whether or not the Crown has proven the charge beyond a reasonable
    doubt. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[48]       The trial judge
      correctly stated and, in my respectful view, properly applied the principles
      of <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> to the evidence adduced in this case.  I would not
      give effect to this ground of appeal.  </span></p>
  <h3>c.     The Improper Rejection of the Alibi Evidence </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[49]        The
      next assignment of error has to do with the trial judge’s rejection of
      the alibi evidence of various defence witnesses who testified about the
      appellant’s activities elsewhere at the time Jennifer Hill swore he uttered
      the threats charged in an interview room on the first floor of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brantford courthouse. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[50]        The
      term “alibi” is a Latin adverb that means “elsewhere”, or “at another place”.  In
      the criminal law, a person charged with an offence who asserts an alibi
      claims that she or he was not at the place and time where the prosecution
      alleges the crime was committed, rather was elsewhere, at another place.  The
      true alibi rests upon evidence that is determinative of the final issue
      of guilt or innocence.  See, <i>R. v. Sgambelluri and Sgambelluri Ltd</i>. (1978),
      43 C.C.C. (2d) 496, 500 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) per MacKinnon ACJO leave to appeal refused (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 496n
    (S.C.C.).  A person who was elsewhere at the time and place a crime was committed
    could not have committed the crime. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line;
'>[51]        This ground of appeal includes, but is not limited to, a submission
      that the learned trial judge:</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>made findings incompatible with
      the onus and standard of proof without clear rejection of the alibi evidence</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[52]        It
      is as well to acknowledge at the outset that a failure to adequately explain
      the reasons for rejecting exculpatory evidence may make it impossible for
      a reviewing court to be satisfied that a conviction was founded on an application
      of the correct legal principles to findings of fact that were reasonably
      open to the trial judge on the evidence adduced.   See, <i>R. v. D.(J.J.R.)</i> (2006),
      215 C.C.C. (3d) 252, 262-3 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) per Doherty J.A. leave to appeal refused (2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) iv (S.C.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[53]        The
      reasons of the learned trial judge, read in their entirety, reveal a clear
      understanding of the essential elements of the offence charged which, if
      the evidence of Jennifer Hill were accepted, and its persuasive force met
      the standard of proof required, were plainly made out.  The reasons also
      evidence full comprehension of the onus and standard of proof and, as we
      have already seen, the way in which the reasonable doubt standard is to
      be applied to cases involving diametrically-opposed version of events,
      one of which is that the other never occurred, in part because the person
      charged was elsewhere.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[54]        In
      his consideration of the evidence of Jennifer Hill, the learned trial judge
      acknowledged the apparent inconsistency between her earlier and sworn account
      about where she encountered Patrick Holley at the courthouse.  He drew
      some comfort from the coincidence of her evidence with other events described
      by defence witnesses and articulated his reasons for accepting her evidence
      in sufficient detail to permit meaningful appellate review.  The learned
      trial judge also demonstrated his appreciation of the discrepancy between
      credibility, on the one hand, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, on the
      other. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[55]        The
      learned trial judge explained why he categorically rejected Patrick Holley’s
      testimony.  Reduced to its essentials, the appellant’s evidence was that
      he never uttered any threats to Jennifer Hill at any time on November 26,
      2004, and did not see her in the morning, as she alleged, because he was
      at his lawyer’s office preparing materials for court until well after the
      time she claimed they met by chance in a courthouse corridor.  It was open
      to the trial judge to reject Holley’s evidence on the ground of a patent
      bias against the child welfare agency of which Jennifer Hill was a member
      and, more generally, the law enforcement community responsible for his
      prosecution.  It was likewise open to the trial judge to conclude that
      the claim of a benign encounter with Ms. Hill, which first surfaced in
      Holley’s cross-examination by Crown counsel, was sheer fiction.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[56]        In
      recording his findings of fact, the learned trial judge said that he was
      satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Patrick Holley uttered the threat
      to Jennifer Hill at some time between 10:00 a.m. and noon on November 26,
      2004.  At other points in his reasons, the learned trial judge seems to
      narrow the timeframe somewhat, but never extends it beyond his initial
      finding.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[57]        As
      a general rule, the time at which an offence is alleged to have occurred
      is not an essential element of the offence.  But the time at which an offence
      was committed may be critical where the person charged defends the case
      by providing evidence of an alibi for the period alleged.  See, <i>R. v.
      B.(G.)</i> (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 200, 218 (S.C.C.) per Wilson J.  To decide
      otherwise would be to deny the person charged his or her right to make
      full answer and defence.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[58]        The
      trial judge clearly rejected Patrick Holley’s denial of the threat alleged,
      likewise his claim that he could not have made the threat because he was
      elsewhere at the time Ms. Hill said it was uttered.  His explanation for
      doing so is adequate to the task of providing sufficient detail to permit
      meaningful appellant review.  That his reasons for rejecting the evidence
      of Mark and Marianne Karkkainen might have been fuller, his considered
      and reasoned acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of the conflicting
      credible evidence of Jennifer Hill is as much an explanation for the rejection
      of the Karkkainens’ evidence as is a rejection based on a problem identified
      with the way they testified or the substance of their evidence.  See, <i>R.
      v. D.(J.J.R.)</i>, above, at page 266, per Doherty J.A. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line;'>[59]        In
      the result, I would not give affect to any ground of appeal alleging error
      in consideration or rejection of the alibi evidence.  </span></p>
  <h3>                d.     The Unreasonableness of the Verdict </h3>
  <p>[60]       The final ground of appeal against conviction is that the conviction
    was unreasonable and either unsupported by or based on a misapprehension
    of the evidence adduced at trial.  To some extent, this ground is linked
    to an earlier complaint that inadequacies in the reasons for judgment reflect
    errors and gaps in legal reasoning or in processing the evidence. </p>
  <p>[61]       The standard against which this familiar ground of appeal must
    be tested is whether the finding of guilt was a conclusion that a properly
    instructed trier of fact acting judicially could reasonably reach.  See, <i>R.
    v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, 185, 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 per McIntyre J.;
    and <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 143, C.C.C. (3d) 1, 21 per
    Arbour J.  A review under section 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code is not
    so narrow as to be confined to a determination of whether there was any evidence
    to support the conviction, or so expansive as to permit a de novo assessment
    of the evidence.  The provision operates as a protection against perverse
    or unsafe convictions.  It is not a licence to be used by appellate courts
    as a means of bringing trial verdicts or decisions in line with the appellate
    court’s estimations of the merits of individual cases.  See, <i>R. v. Quercia</i>,
    [1990] O.J. No. 2063 at [6], per Doherty J.A. (Osborne J.A. concurring).  </p>
  <p>[62]       The command of section 686(1)(a)(i) is that an appellate court
    determine what verdict a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could judicially
    have reached, and in doing so, review, analyze and, within the limits of
    appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.  See, <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>,
    above, at page 21 C.C.C. per Arbour J.  </p>
  <p>[63]       The evidence introduced at trial left it open to a reasonable
    trier of fact, properly instructed, to judicially conclude that Patrick Holley
    uttered the threats described by Jennifer Hill during the morning of November
    26, 2004.  That there was evidence that permitted a contrary conclusion does
    not nullify the availability of the finding made. </p>
  <p>[64]       The trial judge properly applied the analysis described in <i>R.
      v. W.(D)</i> to the evidence of Patrick Holley and his witnesses and provided
      reasons for rejecting that evidence sufficient for meaningful appellate
      review.  The trial judge was cognizant of Ms. Hill’s uncertainty about
      the precise time at which the threat was uttered and took this imprecision
      into account in deciding whether the whole of the evidence measured up
      to the standard of proof required in criminal cases.  He did not subject
      the defence evidence to a higher level of scrutiny than the evidence of
      the prosecution, or misapprehend any evidence or its effect, and thereby
      reach an unreasonable conclusion.  </p>
  <p>[65]       In the result, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal
    and would dismiss the appeal against conviction.  </p>
  <h3>2.       The Appeal from Sentence</h3>
  <h3>a.     Overview </h3>
  <p>[66]        Counsel at trial, who were not counsel on appeal, differed significantly
    about the sentence that should be imposed upon conviction.  Counsel for Patrick
    Holley urged the trial judge to suspend the passing of sentence and order
    that Mr. Holley comply with the terms of the probation order.  The prosecutor
    contended that a fit sentence was imprisonment for six to nine months to
    be followed by a period of probation for one year and a consequential weapons
    prohibition under section 110 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p>[67]        In addition to the submissions of counsel, the trial judge had
    the benefit of a pre-sentence report and a victim impact statement authored
    by Jennifer Hill.  </p>
  <p>[68]        The trial judge sentenced Patrick Holley to imprisonment for
    sixty (60) days followed by required compliance with the terms of a probation
    order for a period of two (2) years.  </p>
  <p>[69]        For Patrick Holley, Mr. Paquette says that the sentence imposed
    is harsh and excessive, the product of several errors:  </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failure
    to give adequate weight to Patrick Holley’s Aboriginal status; </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failure
    to recognize that a conditional sentence of imprisonment would satisfy the
    applicable sentencing principles, including general deterrence and denunciation;
    and </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failure
    to adequately consider the service of the imposed sentence on an intermittent
    basis.</p>
  <h3>b.         The Aboriginal Status of Patrick Holley </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line;
'>[70]        The trial judge was well aware of the Aboriginal status of Patrick
      Holley.  The evidence adduced at trial was saturated with references to
      the local Aboriginal community.  Jennifer Hill was a Band representative
      and service coordinator for Six Nations Child and Family Services.  She
      was the Band representative for the Children’s Aid Society case involving
      Patrick Holley’s children.  The targets of the threats uttered by Mr. Holley
      included police officers and Children’s Aid Society workers on the Six
      Nations Reserve.  And counsel for Mr. Holley reminded the trial judge,
      in his reply submissions on sentence, of Mr. Holley’s Aboriginal Status.  </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line;
'>[71]        The Pre-Sentence Report elucidates Patrick Holley’s background
      including his Aboriginal Status and activities on behalf of his own and
      other First Nations groups.  No separate report or further evidence was
      adduced about Patrick Holley’s Aboriginal status.</span></p>
  <p>[72]        The learned trial judge took Patrick Holley’s Aboriginal status
    into account in determining the nature of the sentence he would impose.  He
    did not undervalue or give less than warranted influence to the provisions
    of section 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial judge appreciated
    that his fundamental duty was to impose a sentence fit for the offence and
    for Patrick Holley.  </p>
  <p>[73]        In this case, the trial judge was dealing with an offender who
    had threatened to cause bodily harm to several justice system participants
    whom he regarded as corrupt.  What he proposed to do would revulse any right-thinking
    person.  At the time he made the threat, Patrick Holley was involved in ongoing
    litigation with some of the agencies whose members he identified in his threat.  He
    was also bound by a peace bond, entered into two months before this offence
    was committed, and arising from other threatening behaviour.  Patrick Holley’s
    evidence at trial revealed an ongoing animosity toward agencies in the local
    Aboriginal community.  </p>
  <p>[74]        In my respectful view, the learned trial judge did not err in
    his appreciation of the sentencing principle described in section 718.2(e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> or in its effect as a sentencing determinant
    in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <h3>c.         Failure to Impose a Conditional Sentence. </h3>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line;
'>[75]        The trial judge considered but rejected a submission that any custodial
      sentence should be served in the community.  The rejection was based on
      principle:  the predominance of denunciation and deterrence as sentencing
      objectives, and the inadequacy of a conditional sentence of imprisonment,
      in the circumstances of this case, to service those objectives.  The conclusion
      reached is amply supported by the record of proceedings and does not reflect
      error. </span></p>
  <h3>d.         Failure to Permit Intermittent Service </h3>
  <p>[76]        Under section 732(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, it was open
    to the trial judge to order that Patrick Holley serve the custodial portion
    of his sentence intermittently.  Factors relevant for this decision included:  </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    age of the offender; </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    character of the offender; </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    nature of the offence; </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence; and </p>
  <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    availability of appropriate accommodation to ensure compliance with the sentence.</p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line;
'>[77]        The trial judge considered whether Patrick Holley should be permitted
      to serve his custodial sentence intermittently.  The principal footing
      upon which the case for intermittent service was advanced, as with the
      claim for a conditional sentence, was that Mr. Holley’s employment, his
      research activities, would be interrupted by “straight time” without advancement
      of any legitimate sentencing objectives or principles.  </span></p>
  <p>[78]        The precise obligations of the appellant, especially the frequency
    and duration of his travel to the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    , were unclear.  No documentation of the fact or nature of the appellant’s
    engagement was ever forthcoming.  The trial judge’s inquiries evoked responses
    that were at once vague and inconsistent.  Absent error, the trial judge’s
    refusal to permit intermittent service of the custodial portion of the sentence
    is entitled to deference.  </p>
  <h3>e.         Conclusion</h3>
  <p>[79]        The sentence imposed in this case on a 39-year old non-violent
    recidivist falls within the range of sentence applicable in such cases.  Indeed,
    it could easily be said to fall within the lower end of that range.  At all
    events, it does not reveal error.  I would grant leave to appeal sentence,
    but dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <h3>       E. DISPOSITION </h3>
  <p><span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>[80]        The appeals from conviction and sentence
