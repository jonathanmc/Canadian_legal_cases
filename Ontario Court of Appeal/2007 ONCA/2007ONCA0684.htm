  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         NATURE OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his convictions for exercising influence for the purpose
    of prostitution, living off the avails of prostitution, two counts of common
    assault and one count of sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    was acquitted of one count of procuring for the purposes of prostitution.
    In addition, the appellant pled guilty to three counts of failure to comply
    with a recognizance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant received a global sentence of eight years which was reduced by
    reason of time served to a global sentence of two years concurrent. In addition,
    the trial judge declared the appellant to be a long-term offender and a supervision
    order for the maximum ten years was imposed. The appellant appeals the validity
    of the long-term offender designation and the length of the supervision order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to conviction, the appellant raises two grounds of appeal respecting
    evidentiary issues that arose during the trial and two grounds relating to
    the charge to the jury. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts may be briefly stated. The charges relate to an eight-day period in
    the fall of 2000. The complainant was a long-time drug addict who had known,
    used drugs with, and purchased drugs from the appellant for about a year.
    In September, 2000, she began making money as a prostitute in order to support
    her addiction. Her evidence was that the appellant procured her to become
    a prostitute and controlled her activity; he also physically and sexually
    assaulted her, took her earnings, and provided her with drugs. On October
    5 she went to the police. The appellant was arrested several days later.  The
    complainant provided the police with a videotaped statement describing the
    appellant’s criminal acts.</p>
  <h3>3.         ISSUES</h3>
  <h3>A.        The Evidentiary Issues</h3>
  <h3>(i)        Should a prior consistent statement from the complainant have
    been admitted?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that she had an injury on her lip caused
    by the appellant and one on her cheek caused by a customer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s counsel cross-examined her on what she had said about her video
    statement at the preliminary inquiry and suggested to her that she had then
    said both injuries were caused by the appellant.  The trial judge permitted
    the Crown on re-examination to refresh the complainant’s memory by referring
    her to another portion of her video statement which was consistent with her
    testimony at trial.  The appellant submits that the re-examination was improper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not certain that the re-examination was improper in these circumstances.
    Counsel’s re-examination clarified for the jury that the complainant, on
    her videotaped statement, had made two statements, one contradictory, and
    one consistent with her evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    objection to the Crown’s re-examination was raised at trial. The trial judge
    adequately charged the jury respecting prior inconsistent statements.  He
    did not refer the jury to the Crown’s re-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    any version, the complainant testified that the appellant had used physical
    force upon her against her will. Thus, the effect of the inconsistency did
    not affect the elements of the offence of common assault, a lesser offence
    than the others charged. What was alleged, an additional mark on the cheek,
    was not significantly more serious than one mark on the lip.  In the end,
    if there was an inconsistency, it was minor and in our view, it did not undermine
    the complainant’s credibility as a whole. We would dismiss this ground of
    appeal. </p>
  <h3>(ii)      Should evidence of later drug use and prostitution by the complainant
    have been admitted or was it, as the trial judge ruled, collateral.</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    issue is the complainant’s testimony at trial that after the eight days the
    charges covered, she changed her life and stopped using drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    part of his defence, the appellant led evidence that the complainant was
    a prostitute before meeting him and that she had a motive to fabricate her
    testimony.  The motive was two-fold: (1) that she was jealous of the appellant’s
    new girlfriend and (2) that she was trying to get her children back.  The
    appellant also sought to adduce evidence that the complainant was still using
    drugs and working as a prostitute following her eight-day relationship with
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that the proposed evidence concerning the complainant’s
    after-the-fact conduct was not relevant to the issues before the jury – namely,
    whether the appellant had procured the complainant to become a prostitute,
    lived off the avails of her trade, and physically or sexually assaulted her – and
    that in essence, it amounted to a collateral attack on her credibility.  In
    so concluding, the trial judge applied the correct legal principles and we
    can find no fault with his analysis.  In the circumstances, we are not persuaded
    that he erred in rejecting the proposed evidence.</p>
  <h3>B.     The issues respecting the charge to the
    jury.</h3>
  <h3>(i)        Was the charge to the jury adequate?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to explain the elements
    of each offence, to relate the evidence to each count, and to properly outline
    the appellant’s position. Further, he says, the jury may have been under
    the impression that it could find the appellant guilty on the charge of living
    off the avails merely if it found that the complainant was buying drugs from
    the appellant with money earned from prostitution. Finally, the appellant
    submits that although the appellant’s position was a complete denial of the
    allegations, the judge told the jury that the defence position was that the
    evidence was not sufficient to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree with the appellant’s submissions.  The appellant did not testify
    nor did he give a statement to the police.  No objection was taken to the
    charge by the appellant’s then trial counsel. While we agree that the trial
    judge could have gone into somewhat more detail, the trial judge adequately
    explained the elements of the offences and the position of the defence to
    the jury. Considering the rest of the charge and the fact that this was a
    brief and straightforward trial, it is inconceivable that the jury did not
    understand the appellant’s position.</p>
  <h3>(ii)      Was a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning required?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant admitted to having been a drug dealer, cocaine addict and prostitute;
    to having given a false name to police two times; and robbing a man at knife
    point. As a result, the appellant submits the trial judge should have given
    the jury a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    was not requested at trial and no objection was made to the charge on this
    basis. The trial judge instructed the jury that it had to proceed with care
    in considering the complainant’s evidence and he thoroughly canvassed the
    complainant’s credibility. Had he been asked to provide a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction,
    he no doubt would have been concerned about its impact on the defence since
    a number of witnesses who testified for the defence also had criminal records
    and similar backgrounds.  In the end, we are not satisfied that this is a
    case where a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution was mandatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal as to conviction is dismissed. </p>

    application under Part XXIV of the <i>Code</i> requires the Attorney General’s
    consent before proceeding. The consent referred to the appellant’s conviction
    for procuring someone to become a prostitute. This was the only count on
    which the accused had been acquitted.  The consent also referred to seven
    of the crimes for which the appellant was convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that a proceeding under this Part of the <i>Code</i> is
    one in which strict compliance with the requirements of the <i>Code</i> should
    be insisted upon. In the absence of a proper consent, he submits the trial
    judge had no jurisdiction to hear the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General’s consent was premised on eight prior convictions, of which
    one was misdescribed. The charge that was misdescribed is not one that would
    form a predicate offence on which the application could be brought.  Moreover,
    an equally serious charge, the offence of exercising control, was omitted
    from the consent document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    section simply requires that the Attorney General’s consent be obtained.
    It was. No objection was made at trial to the form of the consent. In fact,
    both Crown and defence agreed that the evidence supported a finding that
    the appellant was a long-term offender.  We would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      Is the
      length of the long-term offender designation appropriate?</span></h4>

    expert’s opinion was that the appellant’s main problem was substance abuse
    and that a minimum of five years of treatment was necessary. The appellant
    submits he had been in custody for three years at the time of sentencing
    and had not been using any drugs. At the time of release, he would have been
    drug free for five years. This period represented the greatest risk of recidivism.
    Therefore, he submits the maximum length of supervision order was inappropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    length of the order is highly discretionary.  There was evidence that the
    appellant was at high risk to reoffend over a ten year period.  The appellant
    has not suggested that there was some error in principle made. There is nothing
    that brings this order manifestly outside the proper range.</p>
