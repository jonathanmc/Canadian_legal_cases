      interest was $9,966.67.  The defendants claimed partial indemnity costs
      from the date of a settlement offer, which had proposed paying the plaintiff
      $15,000.  The defendants also submitted the plaintiff should not recover
      costs in any event because the amount recovered fell within the monetary
      jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court or, alternatively, because the amount
      fell within the monetary limits provided for the simplified procedure.</span></p>

      Stinson awarded the plaintiff partial indemnity costs.  He found as a fact
      that the defendants’ offer was not a Rule 49 offer because it was not sufficiently “fixed,
      certain and understandable” to allow the plaintiff to
    “contemplate and accept” it, following <i>Yepremian v. Weisz</i> (1993),
    16 O.R. (3d) 121 at 123 (Gen. Div.).  Moreover, he concluded that the plaintiff’s
    success at trial had exceeded the defendant’s offer because s. 267.5(9) applied
    and the plaintiff’s assessed damages before the subtraction of the statutory
    deductible were greater than the offer.  Using the same reasoning, Stinson
    J. also found that the judgment obtained by the plaintiff should not be regarded
    as falling within the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court.  He
    disposed of the question of the simplified procedure on other grounds.</span></p>

      on Rule 49 is not, as I see it, an “arbitrary benefit” to plaintiffs.  Rather,
      such an interpretation encourages insurance companies to make offers of
      settlement that are based on an assessment of the damages actually suffered
      by the plaintiff.  Offers of settlement that fairly reflect the plaintiff’s
      actual damages, without deduction, will encourage settlement.  Plaintiffs
      with small claims who have received such offers will be faced with the
      choice of proceeding to trial where the statutory deductible of $15,000

      267.5(9) supports the objective of s. 267.5(7) by discouraging litigation,
      while at the same time bringing balance and fairness to the system by shielding
