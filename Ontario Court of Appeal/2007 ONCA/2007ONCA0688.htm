style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellant advanced several causes of action against the respondent, at
    trial his claims essentially concerned only two matters.  First, he sought
    to recover from the respondent part of the funds eventually received by the
    respondent under a settlement with the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, to the extent that those funds exceeded the amounts owed by the
    respondent to Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Second, the appellant sought recovery of monies allegedly owed
    to him by the respondent for legal services said to have been rendered by
    the appellant outside the parameters of legal aid certificates granted to
    him in respect of his representation of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge properly rejected these claims and dismissed the
    appellant’s action. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant does not dispute that all costs ordered by a court to be paid to
    an individual who has received legal aid services are the property of Legal
    Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and are to be paid to Legal Aid
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario: see s. 46(4) of the <i>Legal Aid Services Act, 1998</i>, S.O. 1998,
    c. 26.  In addition, s. 95(1) of the Act states: “Except in accordance with
    this Act, no person shall take or receive any payment or other benefit in
    respect of any legal aid services provided by the person under this Act”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    funds at issue on the first branch of the appellant’s claims relate to costs
    recovered by the respondent under a settlement with the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario was eventually paid the sums owed to it from these settlement funds.  The
    costs recovered were the property of Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and could be dealt with by it as it thought appropriate in the exercise
    of its discretion.  On the record before the trial judge, there was no evidence
    of an agreement or other documentation confirming the appellant’s assertion
    that the respondent had agreed to pay him any surplus funds recovered by
    the respondent over and above what was owed to Legal Aid
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    as the trial judge noted, the appellant failed to require the respondent
    to execute a written direction on any of the issued legal aid certificates.  After
    the fact, the appellant attempted to get the respondent to execute a written
    direction, but the respondent refused.  As a result, the appellant had no
    protection for any cost payment in which he may have had an interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, we see no error in the trial judge’s decision that the
    first branch of the appellant’s claims, could not, as a matter of law, succeed.  Thus,
    there would have been no purpose served by permitting the appellant to lead
    further evidence or to advance additional legal argument at trial regarding
    this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second branch of the appellant’s claims concerns payment for services allegedly
    rendered that were not covered by Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  At trial, the appellant indicated that the amount at issue was
    $9,000.  However, following an unsuccessful mistrial motion, the appellant
    informed the trial judge that he declined to proceed at trial on this issue.    Instead,
    the appellant withdrew from the trial without seeking to lead further evidence
    in support of this claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    the trial judge was left with no alternative but to dismiss the appellant’s
    claim for compensation for services allegedly rendered outside the legal
    aid certificates granted.  The appellant failed to prove this claim or to
    establish that funds were owed to him pursuant to an agreement with the respondent
    for compensation beyond the payments made by Legal Aid
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, the appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent cross-appeals for his costs of the trial.  The trial judge declined
    to award costs in his favour.  In the light of the history of this matter,
    including the documentation filed at trial by the appellant, we see no basis
    for interfering with the trial judge’s costs disposition.  The cross-appeal,
    therefore, is also dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, however, is entitled to his costs of the appeal, fixed in the
    total amount of $1,227, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., as sought
    by the respondent.  We award no costs of the cross-appeal.</p>
