style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant sued the respondents to recover damages in the approximate amount
    of $50,000 on account of the alleged wrongful repudiation by the respondents
    of an agreement of purchase and sale entered into on February 7, 2004.  The
    trial judge dismissed the action on the basis that the appellant’s failure
    to pay the deposit provided for under the agreement was fatal to the appellant’s
    claim.  The appellant appeals this decision.  For the following reasons,
    we agree with the trial judge that the appellant’s action cannot succeed.  Accordingly,
    this appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s claim against the respondents must be assessed in the context
    of the particular background and events giving rise to the agreement at issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents entered into an agreement with a builder to purchase a new home.  They
    intended to finance this acquisition from the proceeds of sale of their existing
    home.  The agreement with the builder prohibited the respondents, prior to
    closing, from assigning their interest in the agreement, or purporting to
    sell or convey their rights thereunder, absent the builder’s consent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    entering into the builder’s agreement, it became apparent that the respondents
    would be unable to close the transaction because they were unable to sell
    their existing home.  Accordingly, the respondents consulted a lawyer and
    attempted to secure the builder’s consent to the release of the respondents
    from their obligations under the builder’s agreement.  These attempts proved
    unsuccessful.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter,
    through introductions facilitated by their lawyer, the respondents met with
    Marvin Alexander (an experienced real estate broker), the appellant (Mr.
    Alexander’s wife), and the appellant’s sister, who had expressed an interest
    in acquiring the property in question.  The trial judge found that at this
    meeting, the respondents’ lawyer explained to all persons present –
    including the appellant and Mr. Alexander – the nature of the above-described
    prohibition on assignment or conveyance contained in the builder’s agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result of this meeting, the respondents agreed to assign their interests
    under the builder’s agreement to the appellant’s sister, subject to obtaining
    the builder’s consent to the assignment.  Subsequently, when the builder’s
    consent was not forthcoming, the respondents’ lawyer advised the respondents
    to take the necessary steps to close the transaction contemplated under the
    builder’s agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    this time, all involved parties knew that the respondents lacked the funds
    necessary to complete the purchase from the builder and that they had not
    been able to sell their existing home.  Marvin Alexander and the appellant
    continued to express an interest in the property.  Without the involvement
    and in the absence of the respondents’ lawyer, they met with the respondents
    to discuss the matter further.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Rose Patterson, testified that she and her husband met with Mr.
    Alexander and the appellant to get papers necessary to obtain bank financing
    to close on the builder’s agreement.  She said that the meeting lasted for
    only minutes and that when they arrived they were presented by Mr. Alexander
    with a pre-prepared agreement of purchase and sale concerning the property,
    which provided for the sale of the property by the respondents to the appellant.  The
    respondents signed the agreement (the Bemister Agreement).  Mrs. Patterson
    indicated that neither she nor her husband were advised to seek legal advice
    prior to signing the agreement.  Nor was it suggested by the appellant or
    her husband that the respondents consult the lawyer who had acted for them
    in the preparation of the earlier assignment agreement, although this lawyer
    was both a friend and business acquaintance of Mr. Alexander.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accepted Mrs. Patterson’s evidence on these matters, and rejected
    the testimony of Mr. Alexander where it differed from that of Mrs. Patterson.  In
    particular, the trial judge expressly found that when Mr. Alexander presented
    the Bemister Agreement to the respondents, in the presence of the appellant,
    he knew of the prohibition in the builder’s agreement precluding the sale
    of the property by the respondents without the builder’s consent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against
    this backdrop, we agree with the trial judge that the transaction envisaged
    by the Bemister Agreement was “illegal”, in the sense that it was drawn or
    designed to defeat the rights of the builder under the builder’s agreement:
    see for example, <i>Menard v. Genereux</i> (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 55 (S.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the findings of the trial judge, the appellant and her husband knew that
    the builder’s consent to the sale of the property or to the assignment of
    the builder’s agreement was required.  They also knew that the builder had
    denied consent to an assignment in favour of the appellant’s sister and that
    the builder was holding the respondents to their original bargain.  There
    was no basis, therefore, to conclude that the builder’s consent to a conveyance
    to Mr. Alexander and the appellant would be forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    on the findings of the trial judge, Mr. Alexander – who was “guiding and
    directing [the appellant’s] decisions in this matter” – was seeking an opportunity
    to make a considerable profit on the transaction.  He was an experienced
    real estate broker and, in contrast to the respondents, sophisticated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and her husband entered into the Bemister Agreement to advance
    their own interests.  They were entitled to do so, as long as their actions
    were not designed to wrongly defeat or frustrate the known rights of an innocent
    third party – in this case, the builder.  The illegality of the Bemister
    Agreement arises in this case out of an attempt to circumvent the known provisions
    of the builder’s agreement that protected the interests of the builder, and
    thereby defraud the builder.  The courts will not lend assistance to a plaintiff
    in these circumstances by countenancing the recovery of damages for the breach
    of the offending agreement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled
    to their costs of the appeal on the partial indemnity scale, fixed in the
    amount of $5,000, plus disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
