line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant limited his submission to one
    ground, namely, that the verdict was unreasonable having regard to the frailties
    in the eyewitness identification evidence. For purposes of this argument, the
    appellant concedes that his evidence should not be considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The eyewitness identification came from Officer Van Hetveld.
    He claimed that he saw the appellant on two occasions, within minutes of his
    arrest, and that he had a good view of the appellant on both occasions. He
    further observed the appellant within a minute or so of his arrest and he was
    certain that he was the person he had seen, on two occasions, minutes earlier.
    While it is true that the officer described the appellant’s coat as dark grey,
    instead of dark blue and referred to his hair colour as black, instead of
    brown, these differences were brought to the jury’s attention and in our view,
    they are of little consequence. As for the white hat that the appellant may
    have been wearing at the time of his arrest and which Officer Van Hetveld did
    not see, that too was left to the jury to consider. Importantly, the difference
    does not relate to an immutable characteristic and the appellant could easily
    have put the white hat on after being seen by Officer Van Hetveld and prior to
    his arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, to the extent that Officer Van Hetveld’s
    evidence may have suffered from some frailties, it did not stand alone. Once
    the jury rejected the appellant’s explanation for being in the yard where the
    trucks and trailers were located, his presence there, at 10:22 p.m. on a Saturday
    night, in an industrial area where no other persons were around, provided
    strong circumstantial evidence supportive of Officer Van Hetveld’s
    identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, we are satisfied that the verdict was
    eminently reasonable. In so concluding, we note that the trial judge fully
    canvassed the issues of concern and her instructions on the dangers of
    eyewitness evidence, both generally and specifically, were thorough. Her charge
    was fair and balanced and we see no basis for interfering with the verdicts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed
    and the appeal from sentence is dismissed as abandoned.</p>
