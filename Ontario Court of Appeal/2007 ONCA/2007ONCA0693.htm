    the course of approximately four months (from September 28, 2005 to January
    30, 2006) the respondent sold almost two kilograms of cocaine and twenty-six
    hundred ecstasy tabs to two undercover police officers. He was arrested on
    January 30, 2006, immediately after he had delivered one kilogram of cocaine
    to the officers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    his arrest, the officers searched the respondent and his car and retrieved
    $8,000 in cash along with a loaded .38 calibre revolver. A search of the
    respondent’s apartment revealed an additional $11,070 in cash, 1.149 kilograms
    of marijuana, sixty-six tabs of ecstasy, twenty-three rounds of .38 calibre
    ammunition and a debt list and baggies. In total, the undercover officers
    paid the respondent $74,750 for the various drugs they purchased from him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was twenty-two years old at the time of the offences and twenty-four
    at the time of sentencing. He had a minor unrelated criminal record. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Mitigating
      Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of mitigation, the respondent was relatively young and he expressed remorse
    for his criminal conduct. He comes from a good family and he enjoys the continued
    support of his family, as well as many respectable members of the community.
    By pleading guilty, he spared the administration of justice the time and
    expense of a trial. The respondent is an intelligent young man. While carrying
    on his drug trade, he was attending
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    George
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Brown
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College. He has now resumed his studies there, having completed the ten-month
    custodial sentence imposed by the trial judge. He is presently enrolled in
    the Business Administration – Financial Management Program. While in custody,
    he successfully completed a course designed to assist his reintegration into
    society.  He also provided limited assistance to the police in respect of
    other criminal matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the respondent’s background and history, his appreciation of the gravity
    and seriousness of his crimes and his willingness to change, it appears that
    his prospects for rehabilitation are good. His positive attitude and potential
    for rehabilitation are confirmed in both a positive pre-sentence report and
    a psychological report prepared for the sentencing judge and filed at the
    sentence hearing. Among other things, the psychological report indicates
    that the respondent does not exhibit the behavioural traits and value systems
    often observed in career offenders. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Aggravating
      Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of aggravation, as indicated, the respondent has a criminal record, albeit
    for relatively minor and unrelated offences. More troublesome is the fact
    that he was on bail for production of marijuana when he committed the present
    drug and weapon offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Problematic
    as well is the fact that the respondent’s trafficking was motivated almost
    entirely by greed.  Indeed, in the course of his trafficking activities (which,
    as noted below, extended over a two-year period), the respondent enrolled
    in police college but he chose not to follow that career path because he
    was “making too much money dealing”. In fairness, according to the psychological
    report, the respondent’s trafficking also fulfilled a need on his part to
    form close relationships with others, something he apparently achieved with
    his drug clientele.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of further aggravation, while the present offences spanned a period of
    approximately four months, as mentioned, the respondent’s drug activities,
    on his own admission, lasted the better part of two years. He boasted to
    the undercover officers that he could get them any drugs they needed in whatever
    supply they wanted. His ability to provide them with one kilogram of cocaine
    on the day of his arrest demonstrates that the respondent’s claim was more
    than mere bravado. It also indicates that he was at least a moderately high
    participant in the distribution chain. Of concern as well is the fact that
    in his dealings with the police, the respondent offered to equip them with
    guns. He also indicated an interest in participating with them in a credit
    card scam. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Sentence Imposed by the Trial Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    that backdrop, the trial judge felt that a global sentence of five years
    (sixty months) was warranted – four years for the drug offences and one year
    consecutive (the minimum sentence) for the gun offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that, on account of his guilty plea, the respondent was “entitled
    to a reduction, in my view, of a substantial amount, perhaps 25 percent,
    perhaps 33 and a third percent of what would be the appropriate sentence
    had he elected to got to trial and had he been found guilty…” From the total
    of sixty months, the trial judge subtracted twenty months (a one-third reduction)
    for the respondent’s guilty plea. He then subtracted a further twenty-four
    months for the ten months and nineteen days that the respondent had spent
    in pre-trial custody. Finally, he subtracted an additional six months for
    the limited assistance the respondent had offered to the police following
    his arrest. In the result, the trial judge arrived at a sentence of ten months
    imprisonment. In addition, he placed the respondent on probation for three
    years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals from that sentence. On behalf of the Crown, Mr. Au stated that
    he does not take issue with the twenty-four month reduction for pre-trial
    custody, nor does he object to the six-month reduction for the respondent’s
    limited assistance to the police.  He does, however, object to the one-third
    reduction (twenty months) from the global sentence of five years accorded
    to the respondent on account of his guilty plea. He also submits that the
    global sentence (ultimately determined to be three years and four months
    after deducting twenty months for the guilty plea) was woefully inadequate
    and that it failed to reflect the gravity and seriousness of the respondent’s
    crimes and society’s interest in repudiating conduct of this nature. The
    trial judge, he maintained, failed to give adequate consideration to the
    overriding principles of general and specific deterrence and the need for
    denunciation, particularly in respect of the weapon offence, in arriving
    at the impugned sentence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, taking the respondent’s guilty plea into account, a global sentence
    of five years for this offender for these offences, while extremely low,
    might not have warranted this court’s intervention. However, by applying “a
    twenty five to thirty three and a third percent formula” to reduce the global
    sentence by a third on account of the guilty plea, the trial judge erred
    in principle and arrived at a global sentence (three years and four months)
    that was manifestly inadequate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in two ways. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the credit to be given for a guilty plea cannot be reduced to any formula,
    but “will vary with the circumstances of each case”: see <i>R. v. Faulds </i>(1994)
    O.R. (3d) 13&nbsp;(
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 14. The circumstances of this case were that the appellant was
    caught red-handed, he had no defence to the charges and a trial would simply
    have postponed the inevitable. By pleading guilty, the respondent spared
    the administration of justice some time and expense, and for that, according
    to <i>R. v. Faulds, </i>he was entitled to some credit. In our view, however,
    a twenty month discount for the guilty plea was excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    by using the guilty plea to reduce the global sentence from five years to
    three years and four months, the trial judge effectively determined that
    a sentence of two years and four months was a fit sentence for a mid-level
    drug dealer who, over the course of four months, had sold almost two kilograms
    of cocaine and twenty-six hundred tabs of ecstasy for commercial gain. The “two
    years and four months” figure derives from the fact that the gun offence
    was punishable by a mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of one year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    that way, the inadequacy of the “two years and four months” attributable
    to the drug trafficking offences is brought into sharp focus. It falls well
    short of reflecting the gravity and seriousness of the respondent’s crimes,
    as evidenced by this court’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Bajada</i> (2003),
    173 C.C.C. (3d) 255, where, at 260, Weiler J.A. observed: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It would appear
    that sentences of five to five and one-half years are not uncommon for possession
    of a substantial amount of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking following
    an accused’s plea of guilty or where the accused has no prior record. [Authorities
    omitted]. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>By any
    standard, leaving aside the large amount of ecstasy and the dangers posed
    by it, the respondent trafficked in a substantial amount of cocaine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court and the Supreme Court of Canada have time and again elaborated on the
    perils of cocaine and the immeasurable harm it causes to society.  (See for
    example, <i>R. v. Cunningham</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 at 547 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v.

 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>Smith v. The Queen</i> (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 123 (S.C.C.) and
    more generally, <i>Pushpanathan v.

    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 at paras.
    89-91 per Cory J. in dissent on another issue.) In combination with a loaded
    gun, the situation here represented one of extreme danger. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the last analysis, taking into account the time spent by the respondent in
    pre-trial custody and the special reduction for the limited assistance he
    offered to the police, the respondent should almost certainly have received
    a penitentiary sentence. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly
    inadequate and not within the appropriate range of sentences for crimes of
    this nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of that said, the Crown has not pressed for the respondent’s reincarceration.
    In our view, given his prospects for rehabilitation and the fact that he
    has resumed his schooling and is doing well, we believe that the interests
    of justice would not be served by returning the respondent to jail at this
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    do not accept the Crown’s submission that we should dramatically increase
    the sentence imposed to seven and one half years, on top of the two and one
    half year credits granted by the trial judge. The weakness of this submission
    is demonstrated by the fact that to support it, the Crown was driven to rely
    on importing cases, a proposition flatly rejected by this court in <i>R.
    v. Bajada</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 255. These were serious offences but
    in my view, given the appellant’s age and excellent prospects for rehabilitation,
    a global sentence of five years was appropriate. </p>

    As I see nothing wrong with the global sentence imposed by the trial judge,
    I do not agree with my colleagues that the trial judge erred in two ways. </p>

    Crown does not quarrel with the credits given for pre-trial custody and for
    the assistance the appellant rendered to the police.  As I would not interfere
    with the global sentence of five years, this leaves a period something less
    than twenty months. The appellant has already served the sentence that was
    imposed and has now returned to his studies. I agree that it would not be
    in the interests of justice to return him to jail at this point and therefore
    would dismiss the Crown’s appeal against sentence.  </p>
