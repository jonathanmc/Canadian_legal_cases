    respondents commenced this action in October 1996, but by early 1998 the
    matter had stalled.  The respondents did not answer undertakings on discovery
    and failed to deliver amended pleadings to comply with court orders.  The
    respondents changed solicitors, but the new solicitor failed to file a Notice
    of Change of Solicitors.  On March 4, 1999, the Registrar dismissed the action
    pursuant to rule 48.14 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194 for failure to set the action down within the prescribed time.  Because
    of the failure to file a Notice of Change of Solicitors, neither the respondents
    nor their new counsel were aware that the action had been dismissed.  Nothing
    happened for over four years.  The respondents’ solicitor discovered in June
    2003 that the action had been dismissed, but did not inform his client until
    October.  The respondents’ motion to set aside the Registrar’s order dismissing
    the action was not brought until December 2003, and not heard until February
    2005, almost six years after the order was made.  The Master dismissed the
    motion, but the respondents successfully appealed that decision to a single
    judge of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court who reinstated the action.  The appellant appeals, with
    leave, to this court and asks that the Master’s order be restored.  For the
    following reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the
    Master. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents commenced this action in October 1996 for damages arising from
    the appellant’s agreement to lease, with an option to purchase, a building
    owned by the corporate respondent.  The appellant terminated the lease agreement
    prior to its commencement, alleging breaches by the corporate respondent.  The
    respondents deny these breaches and allege that without the appellant’s rental
    payments, they were unable to maintain the mortgage on the building.  Upon
    the respondents’ default, the mortgagee took possession and eventually sold
    the building to the appellant for $225,000 less than the appellant had agreed
    to pay the respondents in the option agreement.  The respondents claimed
    $3 million for loss of rent, as well as damages for loss of reputation, pain
    and suffering, and mental distress.  The appellant counterclaimed for $1.1
    million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    mid&#8209;March 1997, the respondents had retained a new solicitor, but she
    failed to file a Notice of Change of Solicitors.  Denis Thériault was examined
    for discovery in his personal capacity and as a representative of Thériault
    Ltée on May 29, 1997.  The respondents did not examine a representative of
    the appellant.  The appellant successfully moved to strike the claim of Josée
    Thériault in its entirety, to strike the claims of Denis Thériault and his
    company for pain and suffering, loss of amenities of life, mental distress
    and loss of reputation, and to strike the allegation that the appellant attempted
    to intimidate the respondents by breaching the lease agreement.  This left
    only the claim for loss of rent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    June 1997 to January 1998, the appellant’s solicitor made numerous requests
    for answers to undertakings given on discovery and for an amended statement
    of claim that would comply with the successful pleadings motion.  A small
    number of undertakings were answered, but nothing further was heard from
    the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    February 1998, the respondents retained a third lawyer who served a Notice
    of Change of Solicitors along with a Trial Record.  However, his assistant
    was unable to file these materials as the respondent’s original solicitor,
    still on the record, could not be found and consequently could not be served.  The
    assistant failed to inform the solicitor of this problem and no further attempt
    was made to file either the Notice of Change of Solicitors or the Trial Record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant continued to press for answers to undertakings on discovery and
    for a trial record that contained properly amended pleadings.  The respondents’
    solicitor’s sporadic responses to numerous letters from the appellant failed
    to satisfy those requests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 4, 1999 the Registrar dismissed the respondents’ action for failure
    to set the action down for trial in the time prescribed by rule 48.14.  The
    respondents’ solicitor, who had not filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors,
    did not receive the Notice of Status Hearing or the order dismissing the
    action.  He made no attempt to move the matter forward for over four years
    and indeed remained unaware of the dismissal of the action.  In late May
    2003, the solicitor left his partnership and the respondents’ file was transferred
    to another lawyer in the office.  In mid-June 2003, the new lawyer discovered
    that the action had been dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout,
    the respondents maintained regular contact with their solicitor.  In 2001,
    the solicitor requested and received additional funds from them to prepare
    a motion to deal with outstanding issues concerning the pleadings in order
    to set the matter down for trial.  That motion was never brought. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were not advised of the dismissal until October 2003 and their
    motion to set aside the order dismissing the action was not served until
    December 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    limitation period for the respondents’ cause of action expired in June 2002
    and the appellant’s Vice-President of Finance, the individual best able to
    substantiate the appellant’s set-off and counterclaim, died in May 2000.  In
    view of the dismissal of the action and the passage of time, the appellant’s
    solicitors stripped their file, destroyed all their notes, and sent what
    was left in the file to storage.  The appellant destroyed many of the documents
    relating to the litigation including a significant portion of its records
    relating to its set-off and counterclaim.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master found that the respondents failed to provide an adequate explanation
    for the delay.  He found, at para. 14, that for the entire period of delay,
    from the institution of the action until the discovery of its dismissal, “the
    explanations offered by the respondents and their counsel were less than
    satisfactory.”  Their correspondence with the appellant’s solicitor ceased
    in February 1999 and the respondents failed to communicate to the appellant
    any intention to move the action toward trial.  The Master concluded that
    the respondents’
    solicitor “had put the file in abeyance” and that his conduct spoke “to a
    deliberate intention not to advance the litigation toward trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master also concluded that the second prong of the test – that the dismissal
    resulted from inadvertence – had not been met.  The only evidence of inadvertence
    was the respondents’ solicitor’s statement in his affidavit: “Through inadvertence
    on my behalf, a motion to finalize the issue of the amendments to the pleadings
    was not brought before the court”.  The Master found that the failure to
    receive the Notice of Status Hearing and subsequent order dismissing the
    action resulted from the solicitor’s failure to file a Notice of Change of
    Solicitors properly.  He further found that the solicitor should have known
    that the respondents were required to set the action down for trial within
    two years following the delivery of the statement of defence as required
    by rule 48.14(1).  The solicitor conceded on his cross-examination that the
    reason he had not moved the file forward was that he was simply too busy
    and that “there was no money in the file”.  The Master, quoting Rutherford
    J. in <i>Mandal v. 575419 Ontario Ltd.</i> (1994), 23 C.P.C. (3d) 172 (Ont.
    Gen. Div.), concluded that the dismissal resulted not from the solicitor’s
    inadvertence, but from “his negligence or lack of proper organization bordering
    on negligence” and that this failed to satisfy the second prong of the test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master found that the motion “could have been brought sooner and should have
    been pursued more expeditiously.”  Despite the delay of almost six months
    from when the solicitor discovered the dismissal to when he informed his
    clients, the Master concluded that he would not have refused relief “had
    this been the only factor in issue”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master found that the evidence of prejudice related primarily to the set-off
    and counterclaim.  With the help of the respondents’ solicitor, it was possible
    to recreate the appellant’s solicitor’s file.  The Master concluded, “[w]hile
    there is some prejudice to the [appellant], I am not satisfied that it is
    so significant that it would prevent a fair trial of the action.  The fact
    that [the respondents] may have met this branch of the test is not enough
    since each of the four criteria must be satisfied.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master concluded that the respondents’ failure rested “on the shoulders of
    their solicitor”. He cited the oft-quoted passage from <i>Halton Community
    Credit Union Ltd. V. ICL Computers Canada Ltd. </i>(1985), 1 C.P.C. (2d)
    24 (Ont. C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[I]t is a principle of very long standing that the client is not to be
    placed irrevocably in jeopardy by reason of the neglect or inattention of
    his solicitor, if relief to the client can be given on terms that protect
    his innocent adversary as to costs thrown away and as to the security of
    the legal position he has gained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master found that as the appellant “properly believed that this action and
    a claim for nearly three million in damages had been dismissed nearly six
    years ago,” costs thrown away would be insufficient
    “to protect the security of the legal position” the appellant had gained.  He
    also found that “[t]he [respondents] must consider what other remedies are
    available to them”, an obvious allusion to the respondents’ potential claim
    for damages against their solicitors upon whose shoulders the Master rested
    the respondents’ failure to move the action forward.  </p>

    Divisional Court judge found at para. 50 that as the fault for the delay
    was the “possible negligence” of the respondents’ solicitors in failing to
    file a notice of change of solicitors and the “laziness” of the third solicitor
    in failing to move the matter along, the respondents had shown that the dismissal
    had resulted from inadvertence.  Indeed, he stated at para. 46, that the
    delay from 1998 to 2003 was an “intentional and a stubborn refusal to proceed
    with the action.”  He concluded, however, at para. 48 that “[t]here is no

    requirement of an explanation for the litigation delay ties into a dominant
    theme in modern civil procedure: the discouragement of delay and the enhancement
    of an active judicial role to ensure timely justice.  This action was dismissed
    by the Registrar under rule 48.14: a status notice was sent because the action
    had not been placed on the trial list within two years of the filing of a
    statement of defence, and the respondents failed to set the action down for
    trial within ninety days after receiving the status notice.  Rule 48.14 is
    one of many rules of civil procedure designed to promote the timely resolution
    of disputes, to discourage delay in civil litigation, and to give the courts
    a significant role in reducing delays.  Before the promulgation of Rule 48.14,
    parties had total control over when cases were placed on the trial list.  Rule
    48.14 “establishes a procedure which gives the court a degree of control
    over the speed at which litigation proceeds to a conclusion.…  In essence
    the rule provides for a very limited form of case management.”  Garry D.

    was introduced in part to<span class=documentbody> reduce “unnecessary cost

    for delay is not, of course, an invention of case management.  Rule 24.01
    allows a party to move to dismiss an action for delay where the plaintiff
    has failed to prosecute the action in a timely fashion in accordance with
    the rules.  Moreover, courts may dismiss actions for delay even when the
    relevant rules do not mandate it.  A court has inherent jurisdiction to control
    its own process, which “includes the discretionary power to dismiss an action
    for delay.”  <i>Housser v. Savin Canada Inc.</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 251
    at para. 9 (S.C.J.).  As the Manitoba Court of Appeal wrote, “The power of
    a superior court to strike a matter for want of prosecution does not hinge
    on the niceties of the wording of the rules, but rather flows from the inherent
    power of the court to prevent an abuse of its own process.”  <i>Kuhr v. Pearlman</i> (1991),

    rules and cases rest upon an important principle: there is a strong public
    interest in promoting the timely resolution of disputes.  “The notion that

    centuries, those working with our legal system have recognized that unnecessary
    delay strikes against its core values and have done everything within their

    interest of litigants involved in the civil justice system in timely justice

    the light of the important principle of promoting the timely resolution of
    disputes, I see no reason on the record before us to disagree with the Master’s
    finding that the respondents failed to satisfy the first step of the <i>Reid</i> test.  The
    solicitor “had put the file in abeyance”
    and that his conduct indicated “a deliberate intention not to advance the
    litigation toward trial.”  As the
    <st1:address
w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court judge found, the delay flowed from the solicitor’s “intentional
    and stubborn refusal to proceed with the action.”  The respondents’ solicitors
    failed to observe the rules relating to filing Notices of Change of Solicitor
    or to ensure adequate communication within their office when the assistant
    encountered difficulties in that regard.  This failure meant that the solicitor
    did not receive the Registrar’s Rule 48.14 Notice, but he nonetheless should
    have known that under the Rules of Court, failure to set the action down
    for trial within two years of the statement of defence would lead to the
    action being dismissed.  <i></i></p>

    this calculus implicitly assumes that the court is left with a stark choice
    between defeating the client’s rights and forcing the opposite party to defend
    the case on its merits.  That assumption is faulty where, as in this case,
    the solicitor’s conduct is not mere inadvertence, but amounts to conduct
    very likely to expose the solicitor to liability to the client.  When the
    solicitor is exposed in this way, the choice is different; refusing the client
    an indulgence for delay will not necessarily deny the client a legal remedy. </p>

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court judge, the Master properly distinguished inadvertence from
    negligence.  Leaving the Registrar’s order in place would not necessarily

    the Master to tell the respondents that they should “consider what other
    remedies are available to them”. </p>

    second consideration is that the nature of the delay and the solicitors’ conduct
    in this case amount to more than that kind of lapse or inadvertent mistake
    that the legal system can countenance.  We should opt for a resolution that
    discourages this type of conduct which undermines the important value of
    having disputes resolved in a timely fashion.  The decision of the Master
    sends the right message and provides appropriate incentives to those involved
    in the civil justice system. </p>

    excusing a delay of this magnitude and gravity risks undermining public confidence
    in the administration of justice.  Lawyers who fail to serve their clients
    threaten public confidence in the administration of justice.  The legal profession
    itself has recognized this danger: Commentary to rule 2.01 of the Law Society
    of Upper Canada’s <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i> states, “A lawyer
    who is incompetent does the client a disservice, brings discredit to the
    profession, and <i>may bring the administration of justice into disrepute</i>.” [Emphasis
    added.]  There is a risk that the public would perceive disregarding the
    solicitor’s conduct in the circumstances of this case as the legal system
    protecting its own. Excusing a delay of this kind would through into question
    the willingness of the courts to live up to the stated goal of timely justice.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overall,
    reinstating this action would excuse a five-year delay after the dismissal
    of an action, explained only by the fact that a lawyer formed “a deliberate
    intention not to advance the litigation toward trial” and “put the file in
    abeyance”.  That would risk undermining the integrity and repute of the administration
    of justice. </p>

    fourth step in the <i>Reid</i> test focuses on prejudice to the defendant
    and the goal of having disputes resolved on their merits. The <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure </i>must be interpreted in a manner that recognizes that
    expeditious justice is only one value to be weighed against others and that
    delay may be excused where necessary to ensure complete justice.  As Rule
    1.04(1) states, the rules are to be “liberally construed to secure the just,
    most expeditious and least expensive determination or every civil proceeding <i>on
    its merits.</i>” [Emphasis added].  Expeditious justice must be balanced
    with the public interest in having disputes determined on their merits.  Where,
    despite the delay, the defendant would not be unfairly prejudiced should
    the matter proceed for resolution on the merits, according the plaintiff
    an indulgence is generally favoured.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I view the Master’s finding that the appellant would not be prejudiced in
    presenting its case despite the delay to have been generous to the respondents,
    that finding was not challenged before us.  This aspect of the fourth <i>Reid</i> factor
    and the underlying value of having disputes resolved on their merits favour
    the respondents. However, it is not enough for the respondents to show that
    the appellant could advance its case despite the delay if the matter were
    allowed to proceed to trial.  There are four branches to the<i> Reid</i> test,
    and, according to <i>Scaini, </i>those four factors are not exhaustive.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as the Master correctly observed, the jurisprudence from this court identifies
    as relevant to the fourth <i>Reid</i> factor the security of legal position
    gained by a litigant through a court order granted because of delay or default:
    see <i>Halton Community Credit Union Ltd. V. ICL Computers Canada Ltd., supra.</i></p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finality,
    like the avoidance of unnecessary delay, is a central principle in the administration
    of justice.  “The law rightly seeks a finality to litigation” and finality
    is “a compelling consideration”: <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., </i>[2001]
    2 S.C.R. 460 at paras. 18 and 19.</p>

    an action has been disposed of in favour of a party, that party’s entitlement
    to rely on the finality principle grows stronger as the years pass.  Even
    when the order dismissing the action was made for delay or default and not
    on the merits, and even when the party relying on the order could still defend
    itself despite the delay, it seems to me that at some point the interest
    in finality must trump the opposite party’s plea for an indulgence.  This
    is especially true where, as in the present case, the opposite party appears
    to have another remedy available. </p>

    delay in this case was inordinate.  From the appellant’s perspective, the
    respondents did absolutely nothing to move this file forward for more than

    agree with the Master that, when viewed in the light of a delay of this magnitude,
    the security of the legal position obtained by the appellant becomes an important
    factor to consider.  Five years after the action against it had been dismissed,
    the appellant was entitled to rest on the assurance that the judicial system

    conclude that the Master’s analysis is appropriate because it takes account
    of important principles and values of the civil justice system.  The solicitor’s
    behaviour resulted in an excessive delay.  Delays of this kind are inimical
    to the important goal of timely justice.  The legal system should not condone
    the solicitor’s behaviour as to do so would fail to provide appropriate incentives
