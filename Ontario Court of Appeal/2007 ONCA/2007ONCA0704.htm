  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant brought an application for costs incurred by him, including both
    fees and disbursements, in the representation of Rick Cabral on issues relating
    to solicitor/ client privilege.  The application judge ordered the Crown
    to pay the appellant for his services at the prevailing rates under the Legal
    Aid Plan.  The application judge further ordered that any disputes regarding
    the number of hours for which the appellant should be paid, should be referred
    to the Legal Aid Plan to be dealt with in accordance with its normal procedures.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the application judge should have determined the
    number of hours on the material before him, and because he failed to do so,
    this court should.  The appellant says that the time spent on the file should
    be estimated at 140 hours. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>For
      the following reasons, the appeal is allowed and the compensation to the
      appellant is hereby fixed by this court.</span></p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Law Office of David Costa was searched and the police, pursuant to a warrant,
    seized files relating to Rick Cabral, a former client of Mr. Costa.  Mr.
    Costa was charged with perjury relating to his representation of Mr. Cabral.  The
    material seized was deposited with the Sheriff pending an application to
    determine if any of the seized material was covered by solicitor and client
    privilege. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
      Crown brought an application to determine which, if any, of the documents
      were subject to a proper claim of solicitor and client privilege so that
      those documents not covered could be released to the prosecution.&nbsp; Crown
      counsel with carriage of the case gave notice of the application to the
      appellant so that he could make submissions on behalf of Mr. Cabral.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant made a series of court appearances in response to the Crown’s application
    for access to documents seized from Mr. Costa’s law office.  These appearances
    included a pre-hearing conference before Chief Justice LeSage resulting in
    the order creating the mandate, which was to govern the appellant’s conduct.  A
    further order was issued by Chief Justice LeSage amending the earlier order. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no point in the time regarding the solicitor/client privilege application
    hearing did any Crown representative come to an agreement with the appellant
    as to the hourly rate payable to him in relation to the fees incurred for
    responding to the solicitor/client privilege issues.  Nor did the appellant,
    at any time, request an order for costs in the motion to quash the search
    warrant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown offered payment to the appellant at the Legal Aid rate, which the appellant
    refused.  He brought this application seeking costs for 125 - 150 hours at
    the rate of $350 plus disbursements payable by the Crown.  On appeal, he
    seeks fees of $350 per hour for 140 hours and disbursements of $8,521.25. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      appellant did not keep dockets of the time he expended on the solicitor/client
      issues.  He indicated that the total hours being claimed by him are estimates
      based on his best recollection.</span></p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the application judge erred in concluding that he was bound to
    award the rate decided by the government that is appropriate for legal aid,
    and by declining to exercise his own judgment on what was a reasonable remuneration
    for the appellant.  In doing so the application judge wrongly fettered his
    discretion, and erred in determining that this is a case where the appellant’s
    engagement was pursuant to the criminal interest of his client.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was the client’s interest in privilege only that was engaged so that the
    use of the criminal legal aid rate is not as directly relevant as the application
    judge assumed. While it is true that the privilege issue arose in a criminal
    case, it was not a criminal case in which the client’s interest was engaged,
    except for the issue of privilege.  Indeed, we were advised that the criminal
    matter against the client in which the appellant acted had been concluded
    at this point. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the application judge did not deal with how disbursements are to
    be dealt with.  Nor is it clear from his reasons how Legal Aid’s process
    for dealing with the appropriate number of hours is applicable, given that
    this would be a case where legal aid would not have granted a certificate. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the error in principle we would set aside his conclusion.  Furthermore, the
    record is such that this court is able to exercise the proper discretion.  In
    doing so, we believe it is however appropriate to take into account the fact
    that these are public funds and one marker for the level of expenditure of
    public funds on an hourly basis is what legal aid pays in criminal matters.  However,
    it is not the only marker. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, a reasonable hourly rate for the appellant would be $200.  The
    parties responded to our request to supply us with arguments about whether
    the 140 hours spent by the appellant is reasonable.  After considering their
    submissions we are of the view that the time is reasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    to disbursements we are of the view that the appellant should receive them.  These
    are for the retention of a computer expert and two lawyers to provide junioring
    services.  Neither of the latter are significant amounts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    level of compensation is reasonable given that the interest of justice required
    that the appellant’s client be represented on the privileged debate.  While
    the appellant was not strictly serving as an amicus, it is an apt comparison. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      appeal is allowed.  As noted, we are of the view that the record permits
      this court to exercise its discretion and fix the costs.  Accordingly,
      the order of the application judge is varied to award the appellant fees
      of $200 per hour for 140 hours and disburse-ments of $8,521.25.  There
      is no order as to costs as the appellant is not seeking any.</span></p>
