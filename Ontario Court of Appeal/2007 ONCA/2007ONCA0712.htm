    Murphy, a 13-year employee of the Canada Border Service Agency, approached
    the appellant as he was walking to the baggage carousel to retrieve his luggage.  She
    asked the appellant where he was coming from.  On learning that the appellant
    had visited
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Bulgaria</st1:country-region>
    , Inspector Murphy referred him to the secondary inspection area as she had
    never intercepted or talked to anyone who had vacationed in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Bulgaria</st1:country-region>

    the secondary examination area, the appellant appeared extremely nervous.  His
    hands were visibly shaking and he was perspiring so much the sweat was dripping
    off his forehead.  Inspector Murphy testified that she had never seen anyone
    perspire as much as the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, who was now in possession of his luggage, told the inspector that
    the suitcase was his, that he had packed it and that he was aware of its
    contents.  The suitcase had no name-tag on it.  It was wrapped in blue plastic
    and appeared to be brand new – it did not have a scratch on it.  The appellant
    unwrapped and unlocked the suitcase.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Inside the suitcase there were six coats and two
    pairs of shoes (sizes 39 and 43), all of which appeared to be brand-new.  The
    appellant said the clothes were gifts for his girlfriend and then pointed
    to one of the sheepskin jackets.  When asked where his clothing was, the
    appellant said he’d left all of it with his brother in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    smell of glue was evident as soon as Inspector Murphy began to remove the
    clothing from the suitcase.  The suitcase was very heavy; it weighed 13.7
    kilograms when empty.  An x-ray of the suitcase revealed that something was
    in its walls.  Opium, which weighed 5.9 kilograms, was found inside the lining
    of the walls of the suitcase.  The estimated value of the opium was $118,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested and turned over to R.C.M.P. officers Wellings and
    Morrissey.  He gave a lengthy interview.  Although he did not testify at
    trial, the jury, with the consent of counsel, was provided with a videotape
    of the interview and a transcript of the interview. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the interview, the appellant said that he had been in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Bulgaria</st1:country-region>
    with a friend of his named Yousef.  While speaking with Yousef at the airport
    in Sophia, he was approached by an unnamed man who noticed that he was speaking
    Farsi and going to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  This unnamed man asked the appellant to take one of his suitcases
    as he had too many.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>  The appellant agreed to
    help but only after asking what was in the suitcase and then opening it and
    examining the contents.  The man gave the appellant the combination to the
    suitcase and enough money to buy cellophane in which to wrap the suitcase.  He
    took the appellant’s cell phone number and said that a friend of his would
    call the appellant after the appellant was in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto and the friend would then retrieve the bag.  The appellant refused
    to give the police Yousef’s last name as he did want to get Yousef involved.  He
    said he did not know where Yousef was because Yousef had remained in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <h3>The Opinion Evidence of the RCMP Officers</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of appeal relates to testimony given by Officers Wellings and
    Morrissey, the R.C.M.P. officers who interviewed the appellant.  The appellant
    argues that Officers Wellings and Morrissey expressed opinions for which
    they were not qualified and that the opinion evidence was highly prejudicial.  Consequently,
    the appellant maintains, the evidence ought not to have been admitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impugned evidence is as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>  In cross-examination,
    Officer Wellings indicated that the appellant’s fingerprints did not appear
    on the packaging holding the drugs.  The Crown re-examined Officer Wellings
    who stated that, based on her experience, “most of the time a courier doesn’t
    touch the drugs”.  This view was reiterated by Officer Morrissey in his testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>  In response
    to the absence of evidence that the appellant was a drug user, Officers Wellings
    and Morrissey both indicated that, in their experience, large quantities
    of drugs are not entrusted to couriers who are drug users.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>  Officer
    Wellings testified that people commonly put name tags on their suitcases
    and that one indicator that a bag contains drugs is the absence of a name
    tag as “[m]ost couriers do not want their bags properly identified back to
    them or anybody”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>  Officer
    Morrissey described the appellant’s statement as a “story” that was “rehearsed”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the fourth statement is of a different character than the others, I will
    deal with it separately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first three impugned statements, I begin by noting that,
    at trial, the defence did not object to their admission.  Instead, defence
    counsel attempted to elicit similar information from the officers during
    cross examination, asking the officers questions about the role of couriers
    and the types of indicators that are used to predict if someone is a courier.  He
    also asked the officers to explain the concept of a blind courier or an unwitting
    dupe to the jury.  Furthermore, ultimately, he relied on this type of evidence
    in support of his contention that the appellant had been nothing more than
    a dupe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth statement to which objection is taken – that the appellant’s story
    appeared “rehearsed” – is of a different character.  As the Crown properly
    concedes, it would have been preferable had Officer Morrissey not expressed
    the opinion that the appellant’s statement appeared “rehearsed”.  However,
    it is important to consider the comment in context.  It arose as a result
    of the officer’s misunderstanding of a question relating to the appellant’s
    physical demeanour during the interview.  Crown counsel immediately asked
    the officer to confine his testimony to physical observations and the officer
    did so.  As the statement formed no part of the case against the appellant
    as argued by the Crown and the trial judge properly instructed the jury that
    they alone had to assess the evidence and decide guilt or innocence, I do
    not see the appellant as having been prejudiced by the admission of this
    statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    even if the impugned testimony was improperly admitted, its admission did
    not prejudice the appellant. At the end of the day, there is no dispute that
    the appellant was a drug courier. It was never suggested that he was an addict
    or that he had handled the drugs. The evidence was clear that the appellant
    brought the opium into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . The question with which the jury had to grapple was whether he knowingly
    brought the drugs into
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    or was an unwitting dupe.  The evidence to which the appellant now objects
    has little relevance to that issue and cannot reasonably be said to have
    undermined the fairness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Charge on Wilful Blindness</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge charged the jury on the concepts of actual knowledge and willful
    blindness in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Knowledge</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This, of course, is the crucial issue. The Crown
    must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Rashidi intended to
    import the controlled substance knowing that the substance he was carrying
    was a controlled substance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Intention to import requires knowledge that what
    was imported was a controlled substance.  In other words, the Crown must
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Rashidi knew that the suitcase contained
    an illegal substance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, if an accused is unaware that there is an illegal
    drug contained in something which is in his or her possession and  which
    is being carried into the country, or if you have a doubt about this issue,
    then knowledge, an essential and necessary element of intention is not proven.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are two ways the Crown may prove knowledge.
    Knowledge may be proved that there was either actual knowledge of the illegal
    substance or what is called “wilful blindness” concerning the existence of
    the substance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What is
    “wilful blindness” in this context? Where a person has become aware of the
    need for some inquiry about whether there was a prohibited drug in the suitcase
    or the item, in this case a suitcase, but declines to make the inquiry because
    he does not wish to know the truth, or would prefer to remain ignorant, in
    other words, is “wilfully blind” to the facts, the law still holds that person
    criminally responsible, as if he had actually knowledge. Wilful blindness
    is the state of mind of someone who is aware of the need to make an inquiry
    and deliberately fails to do so. It is imputed knowledge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, mere negligence or recklessness is not
    enough. Wilful blindness is a higher standard than either negligence or recklessness.
    The person must be aware of the need to make an inquiry about whether prohibited
    drugs were concealed in the suitcase, but decided not to because they did
    not wish to know the truth and preferred to remain ignorant. You may ask: “Did
    the accused shut his eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that asking
    would fix him with knowledge?”  Wilful blindness is the state of mind of
    someone who is well aware of the need to make an inquiry and then deliberately
    fails to do so because they do not want to know the truth. They prefer to
    remain ignorant. As I stated a minute ago, wilful blindness is equivalent
    to actual knowledge; it is imputed knowledge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, the real issue to be decided on all
    of the evidence is whether Mr. Rashidi actually knew or was wilfully blind
    to the fact that he was carrying an illegal drug.  You and I have no way
    of opening up a person’s head and looking into their mind and reading what
    is going on.  As a result, you determine a person’s knowledge on the basis
    of an inference you draw from the conduct, statements and activities of the
    accused viewed in the context of all of the surrounding circumstances.</p>

    appellant submits that these instructions were deficient in three ways.  First,
    it is argued that they failed to make clear to the jury the extent to which
    wilful blindness differs from actual knowledge and from recklessness.  Second,
    it is contended that it was insufficient for the trial judge to instruct
    the jury that they “may” ask if the appellant knew or strongly suspected
    that further inquiry would fix him with knowledge.  On this point, the appellant
    maintains that the trial judge ought to have made it clear that unless the
    Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that either the appellant knew there
    were drugs in the suitcase or “strongly suspected that looking would fix
    him knowledge”, the appellant was to be acquitted.  Third, the appellant
    argues that it was a fatal error for the trial judge to fail to relate the
    evidence to the test for wilful blindness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this submission.  In my view, the charge clearly explained the concept
    of wilful blindness.  There can be no question but that the jury fully understood
    the significance of considering the evidence relating to what the appellant
    knew and the steps he claimed to have taken in the Sophia airport to satisfy
    himself about the contents of the suitcase. Equally, there can be no question
    that the jury knew it had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the
    issue of knowledge.  The charge was replete with references to the Crown’s
    burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt including, as the extract
    above demonstrates, on the issue of knowledge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argued that the trial judge erred by stating that the jury <i>may</i> ask: “Did
    the accused shut his eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that looking
    would fix him with knowledge?”  While <i>R. v. Jorgensen, </i>[1995] 4 S.C.R.
    55 states that the answer to the question <i>must</i> be answered affirmatively,
    the trial judge’s statement that the jury <i>may</i> ask this question is
    not problematic.  A person is wilfully blind if he or she deliberately chooses
    not to know something when given reason to believe further inquiry is necessary
    (<i>Jorgensen</i> at 135).  If the jury concludes that an accused is wilfully
    blind, the question will necessarily be answered in the affirmative.  In
    the present case, the jury must have answered the question affirmatively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    suggestion that the trial judge failed to contextualise the test for wilful
    blindness with the specific facts of this case is untenable.  The trial judge
    fully canvassed the accused’s explanation, as given in his interview with
    the R.C.M.P., and related it to the issue of knowledge and wilful blindness.  Immediately
    thereafter, he gave the defence’s theory of the case.  He did so based on
    the written statement provided to him by counsel.  The trial judge read the
    statement, after ensuring that the jury was aware that they were arguments
    rather than evidence.  It contained the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>He made the requisite inquiries
    that a reasonable person would be expected to make.  He asked what was in
    the bag and the bag was then opened and in a relaxed fashion the man showed
    him the jackets and shoes.  There was nothing visible to the accused, nor
    would have been apparent even to the trained R.C.M.P. officer that there
    was anything illegal in that bag on first inspection.  There was no reason
    to suspect that the bag contained narcotics and there is no evidence that
    the accused failed to inquire as to the contents of the bag in an attempt
    to avoid having actual knowledge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not see <i>R. v. Lagace</i> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 12 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), as assisting the appellant.  In <i>Lagace,</i> Doherty J.A. held that
    where some inquiry is made, it must be determined whether the accused still
    harbours a suspicion despite the inquiries.  While the appellant made some
    inquiries, it was open to the jury to find that he still harboured suspicions.  For
    example, there is no explanation for why the appellant failed to inquire
    about the smell of glue in the suitcase which must have been evident to him
    when he examined its contents nor why he failed to inquire about the suitcase’s
    abnormal weight.  Given these facts, and the warning from his friend that
    the appellant admits he received, there was ample evidence on which the jury
    could find that the appellant still harboured suspicions even if a basic
    inquiry had been conducted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

      OF THE OFFENCE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I mention above, the court did not call on the Crown to respond to the third
    ground of appeal, namely, whether the jury was properly instructed on the
    knowledge requirement of the offence.  The core of the appellant’s argument
    on this ground is that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that the
    Crown had to prove that the appellant knew that he was importing a controlled
    drug.  He submits that while the trial judge did specify once that the illegal
    substance was illegal drugs, it was insufficient as it left it open for the
    jury to conclude that the appellant had knowledge that the suitcase contained
    some type of illegal substance, whether drugs or otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge began the charge by instructing the jury that the appellant was
    charged with importing opium into
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    contrary to the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substance Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c.
    19, s. 6(1).  He explained that the jury could only convict if the Crown
    proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to import a controlled
    substance and that opium is a controlled substance.  The jury would have
    understood later references in the charge to an “illegal substance” as referring
    to the opium.  There is nothing in this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>SENTENCE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that, in the circumstances, the sentence was harsh and
    excessive.  In making this submission, he notes that the scant jurisprudence
    on sentences for opium importers is dated and argues that in any event, as
    a first offender, a more lenient sentence ought to have been imposed.  He
    points also to the fresh evidence from his employer which attests to his
    continuing hard work while on bail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge carefully considered the relevant authorities and concluded
    that <i>R. v. Abolmolouk </i>(1997), 32 O.R. 3(d) 653 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) most closely resembled the case before him.  As in the present case, the
    accused was a middle-aged first offender and a non-user.  In <i>Abolmolouk</i>,
    this court reduced the sentence from seven years to four years, in addition
    to six months of pre-trial custody.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the sentencing judge noted, the quantity of drugs involved in <i>Abolmolouk </i>was
    significantly smaller than in the present case.  In <i>Abolmolouk</i>, only
    805 grams of opium had been imported whereas in the case at bar, the quantity
    of opium was almost 6 kilograms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge also carefully considered the nature of the offence and
    the circumstances of the offender.  In terms of mitigating factors, the sentencing
    judge noted that at age thirty-six, the appellant had no criminal record,
    was a hard-working person who had maintained steady employment since arriving
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1996 and who had complied with his bail conditions.  He noted also that
    there is a restricted market for opium in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of aggravating factors, the sentencing judge identified the substantial
    quantity of opium, the fact that the appellant was a nonuser and that the
    opium had been imported for the clear purpose of trafficking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the sentencing judge’s references to Justice Cory’s comments
    (in dissent) in <i>Pushpanthan v.Canada, </i>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982<i>  </i>as
    to the serious threat posed by the importation of dangerous drugs, and to
    the statements of Feldman J.A. in <i>R. v. Wellington</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C.
    (3d) 470 (Ont. C.A.), to the effect that when sentencing drug couriers, the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
