    appellant, Maurice Young, appeals his convictions of possession of cocaine
    and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking.  He has already served his
    sentence.  The appellant requests that this court quash the convictions and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 22, 2002, members of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto police executed a search warrant in the basement apartment of 16
    <st1:PlaceName

    Roseneath
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Gardens in

    Toronto. Inside, the police recovered 9.3 grams of crack cocaine and 253
    grams of marijuana, as well as other drug paraphernalia.  In the apartment
    bedroom, the police located a black day timer and a knapsack including receipts
    and bills in the name of Maurice Young.  An electronic digital scale and
    lists of names and amounts of money consistent with the appearance of drug
    debt lists were also recovered.  The day timer included several noted reminders
    to “walk the dogs”. Six pit bull puppies were found in the apartment.  Documents
    in the name of Hugh McPherson were also found.  However, this individual
    had been in jail for ten months at the time the search warrant was executed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the judge drew the inference that the day timer, knapsack and their
    contents were the property of the appellant.  The trial judge accepted the
    evidence of Constable Bazmi, who testified that he had observed the appellant
    leaving the apartment prior to the execution of the search warrant and had
    also observed a man walk up to the residence and leave minutes prior to the
    appellant’s departure.  From this evidence, the trial judge drew the inference
    that a sale of drugs had likely occurred. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that Mr. McPherson was the tenant of the apartment
    and had given control of the premises and its contents to the appellant while
    he was in jail, likely to care for his dogs.  He rejected the defence submission
    that knowledge and control were not satisfied since most of the drugs and
    paraphernalia were not in “plain view”.  In his view, the appellant’s knowledge
    and control of the premises extended to the drugs.  In support of this finding,
    the trial judge referred to those items of drug paraphernalia which were
    in plain view, including a small spoon with traces of cocaine, scales, a
    calculator and exacto knives.  The trial judge also noted that .24 grams
    of the cocaine was found wrapped in clear plastic in plain view on the kitchen
    counter.  From this evidence, the trial judge drew the inference that the
    accused was in possession of the drugs. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the defence conceded that if the appellant was found in possession
    of the drugs, then his possession would be for the purpose of trafficking
    because of the quantity seized and the drug paraphernalia recovered.  Based
    on his finding and the concession by the appellant, the trial judge found
    the appellant guilty of both counts in the indictment. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the appeal, the appellant pursued a fresh evidence application which was
    based on the Crown’s late disclosure at the opening of trial of the fact
    that McPherson was in jail at the time the search warrant was obtained and
    executed.  The issue arises in the following circumstances.  When the police
    obtained the search warrant to search the Roseneath premises, the affiant
    swore that the informant had observed two males at the premises, the appellant
    and Mr. McPherson.  He also deposed that the information provided by the
    source, which included information about drugs and firearms, was current.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Lafontaine, who represented the appellant throughout these proceedings, together
    with his junior, were aware from other proceedings that Mr McPherson had
    been incarcerated from July 2001 and remained incarcerated when the search
    warrant was obtained and executed.  Thus, Mr. Lafontaine knew that the information
    to obtain the search warrant was not accurate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    when disclosure was first made, it was clear that the Crown was not aware
    that Mr. McPherson was in jail at the relevant time.  Mr. Lafontaine made
    a tactical decision not to pursue an attack on the search warrant through
    a s. 8 <i>Charter</i> challenge, but instead to defend the appellant on the
    basis that, because the Crown believed McPherson was also an occupant of
    the apartment at the relevant time, it would have difficulty in proving the
    requisite degree of possession and control by the appellant of the drugs
    that were found during the search.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no suggestion that this was not an appropriate defence strategy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    it transpired, Mr. Lafontaine was unable to conduct the trial on the scheduled
    date and briefed his junior to do so.  During the week before the scheduled
    trial date, Mr. Lafontaine attempted to negotiate a resolution of the charges
    on the basis that the Crown would have difficulty proving the necessary possession
    by the appellant.  In that context, the Crown re-examined the evidence with
    the police and, on the morning of trial, the Crown learned that Mr. McPherson
    had been incarcerated at the time of the offences and disclosed that information
    to the junior lawyer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    junior lawyer had not been briefed about the decision not to pursue the <i>Charter</i> challenge,
    a decision that was based on the desire not to disclose to the Crown that
    Mr. McPherson was in jail and not in the Roseneath premises at the time of
    the offences.  When the trial judge asked the junior lawyer whether he was
    surprised by the information in the disclosure, he replied that he was not. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    receiving the late disclosure, the junior lawyer did not seek an adjournment
    and proceeded with the trial on the merits.  The appellant was convicted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    preparing for the appeal, Mr. Lafontaine determined, because of the late
    disclosure, that he was deprived of the opportunity to choose his defence
    strategy on a fully-informed basis and therefore sought to bring the issue
    before this court on the appeal.  In the process of developing the fresh
    evidence, the Crown learned and disclosed to the defence that the police
    had in fact known of Mr. McPherson’s incarceration one week after execution
    of the search warrant, but had not informed Crown counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argued, in reliance on <i>R. v. Dixon</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d)
    1 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Teillefer</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.),
    that there was a reasonable possibility that the Crown’s non-disclosure and
    late disclosure affected the overall fairness of the trial process on the
    basis that there were “reasonably possible avenues of investigation that
    were closed to the appellant as a result of non-disclosure [here, late disclosure]”.  See
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Dixon</i>, para. 34.  The appellant says that he could have sought to
    cross-examine the affiant of the affidavit to obtain the search warrant to
    impugn the currency of the informant’s information and therefore its veracity
    and on that basis to have successfully challenged the search warrant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in our view, although there was clear non-disclosure/late disclosure by the
    Crown, this could not have affected trial fairness in the circumstances of
    this case.  Mr. Lafontaine had all the information he needed to challenge
    the search warrant had he elected to do so and had he believed that to be
    a fruitful avenue to pursue in the appellant’s defence.  He was clearly not
    precluded from following that avenue of investigation by the Crown’s non-disclosure.  Rather,
    he chose not to do so in order to capitalize on his belief that the Crown
    did not know about Mr. McPherson’s incarceration, and to pursue the defence
    that the Crown would not be able to prove possession. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the evidence before us, Mr. Lafontaine and his junior have not suggested,
    had Mr. Lafontaine been at the trial and received the disclosure at that
    time, that he would then have sought to change tactics to challenge the search
    warrant because that would have been a fruitful avenue to pursue.  The highest
    it was put was by the junior in his affidavit who stated “I have every confidence
    that had it [the disclosure] been provided to our office before Friday, January
    27, 2006, Mr. Lafontaine would have reacted to the shift in the Crown’s case
    by rethinking the defence that would be advanced and by relying on s. 8 of
    the Charter where it had previously seemed more harmful than helpful to do
    so.”  Importantly, the affidavit did not suggest that the Charter challenge
    would have had a better chance of success once the disclosure was made. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    that regard, even if the information with respect to Mr. McPherson were excised
    from the affiant’s affidavit, the balance of the affidavit supported the
    issuance of the search warrant.  This was no doubt why Mr. Lafontaine elected
    not to pursue the <i>Charter </i>challenge initially, knowing as he did,
    that the informant had provided false information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Lafontaine made a reasonable tactical decision based on the disclosure and
    information he had, and elected to pursue a defence that relied on his belief
    that the Crown was misinformed about the true situation.  In that circumstance,
    the appellant cannot now argue that the late disclosure about the Crown’s
    knowledge of Mr.&nbsp;McPherson’s whereabouts affected trial fairness in
    the sense of preventing Mr.&nbsp;Lafontaine from taking steps otherwise available
    to him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    one point in the appeal it was suggested that this fresh evidence application
    should have been brought on the basis of ineffective assistance of defence
    counsel.  We do not agree.  In our view, defence counsel made tactical decisions
    appropriate to the circumstances, presumably on instructions and on the basis
    that they were in the best interests of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    therefore reject the fresh evidence application and would not order a new
    trial on that basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellant did not pursue the other grounds of appeal in oral argument,
    he continues to rely on his written submissions contained in his factum.  The
    appellant argues that the trial judge used a day timer and a Rogers’ bill
    with the appellant’s name, and other documents found in the apartment, as
    proof that the appellant had the requisite degree of control of the apartment
    and therefore its contents, rather than for the limited circumstantial value
    allowed by <i>R. v. Emes</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 124 (Ont. C.A.).  In
    our view, this submission cannot succeed.  The trial judge made proper use
    of the documentary evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the Crown acknowledges, the trial judge made an error in finding that the
    white powdery residue on the spoon and in beakers in the apartment was cocaine,
    although it was never analyzed.  The trial judge’s conclusion about the nature
    of the substance was supported by other paraphernalia that was found in plain
    view in the kitchen, as well as the appellant’s admission that .24 grams
    of crack cocaine were found in plain view in the kitchen.  We agree with
    the Crown that in these circumstances, the trial judge’s error was harmless.  We
    also reject the submission that the verdict was unreasonable.  </p>
