style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasons of the summary conviction appeal court judge are reflective of the
    oral argument put to him both in terms of the order in which he addressed
    the issues and the time spent on the issues.  In his reasons, the summary
    conviction appeal court judge indicated that the trial judge had conducted
    a careful review of the evidence as a whole.  He also indicated that the
    trial judge had given thorough reasons in support of his findings and that
    he had addressed the competing credibility issues and applied the proper
    standard of proof.  Furthermore, the summary conviction appeal court judge
    indicated that he could find no “manifest error of fact”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, these comments reflect a considered rejection of the appellant’s
    arguments that the trial judge made material misapprehensions of the evidence
    and that the trial judge failed to properly assess the competing credibility
    claims.  In our view, on a reading of the summary conviction appeal court
    judge’s reasons, an appellant would know why his appeal was unsuccessful.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do the reasons of the summary conviction appeal court judge prevent effective
    appellate review in this court.  Mr. Sandler has raised the same arguments
    as were raised in the appeal court below.  We have addressed those arguments
    on their merits.  The merits are determined by reference to the trial record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first argument advanced by Mr. Sandler arises out of the complainant’s  testimony
    concerning what she had told her doctor the day after the alleged assault.  Counsel
    contends that the conversation summarized in the doctor’s notes is inconsistent
    with the complainant’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her evidence, the complainant said that she did not tell the doctor that
    she had been injured by the appellant.  The appellant does not suggest that
    she did.  Counsel argues, however, that the doctor’s notes indicate that
    the complainant told the doctor that she had been injured when she was feeding
    the farm animals.  The appellant had testified that this is what the complainant
    told him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    notes are cryptic and, in our view, do not reveal any inconsistency with
    the complainant’s trial evidence.  They are, at best, ambiguous.  If counsel
    saw the notes as revealing a potentially significant inconsistency, it was
    incumbent on counsel to explore that potential inconsistency and develop
    it so that its significance to the question of the complainant’s credibility
    could be made clear.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second complaint arises out of the trial judge’s indication that there was
    no evidence that the complainant had any propensity to act violently towards
    others.  It was open to the trial judge to find that evidence of a single
    incident involving the appellant’s former wife and the complainant did not
    provide any evidence of a propensity to act violently towards others.  One
    event is not necessarily evidence of any propensity to act in a certain way.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only other source of evidence that could potentially demonstrate the complainant’s
    propensity to act violently towards others came from the appellant.  The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence for reasons set out in the
    trial judge’s extensive analysis of the appellant’s credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also reject the third argument advanced on appeal.  Counsel contended that
    it was not open to the trial judge to find that the appellant’s evidence,
    and in particular his allegation that the complainant had a propensity for
    violence, revealed an animosity which adversely affected the appellant’s
    credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is open to a trier of fact, who has the benefit of seeing the witnesses,
    to conclude that the manner in which a particular witness testifies reveals
    an intense animosity towards the other side which in the circumstances undermines
    the credibility of that witness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next argument relates to the photographs and audiotape relied on by the Crown.  The
    evidence of the photographs and the audiotape were properly viewed by the
    trial judge as confirmatory of the complainant’s evidence concerning the
    assault and the threat.  The photographs and audiotape were confirmatory
    in that they made the complainant’s story more credible than it would have
    been but for the existence of that evidence.  The fact that the photographs
    and audiotape were not necessarily inconsistent with the appellant’s version
    of events did not cause them to lose their ability to serve as evidence confirming
    the credibility of the complainant’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    final argument canvassed by counsel rests on the contention that the trial
    judge subjected the appellant’s testimony to a higher level of scrutiny than
    the complainant’s testimony.  We must reject that submission.  This was a
    difficult case from a credibility point of view.  There were difficulties
    with the evidence of both the complainant and the appellant.  We are satisfied
    that the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate a thorough review of the relevant
    considerations.  The reasons he gave for ultimately finding that the complainant
    was credible and the appellant was incredible all properly arise from the
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal sentence.  Mr. Sandler did not make
    any oral submissions in support of that application in part because of time
    constraints.  We see no basis upon which leave to appeal the sentence should
    be granted.  The fitness of the sentence has already been reviewed by one
    appellate court and indeed reduced by that court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    grant leave to appeal from the decision affirming the conviction, but dismiss
    the appeal and we refuse leave to appeal from the sentence imposed in the
    summary conviction appeal court. </p>
