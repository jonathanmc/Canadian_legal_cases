    Valin Johnson’s death is compounded by the fact her uncle, William
    Mullins-Johnson, was wrongfully convicted of her murder and spent twelve years
    in prison.  It is now clear that there is
    no evidence that Valin Johnson was assaulted or murdered, and no evidence that
    Mr. Mullins-Johnson was guilty of any crime in relation to her death.  </p>

    found their daughter lying dead on her bed.  Her body was taken to the

    for an autopsy to be performed by Dr. Bhubendra Rasaiah.  While the autopsy began at 12:55&nbsp;p.m.,
    the dissection of the body did not begin until 4:50 p.m. However, well before
    Dr. Rasaiah began the dissection, he called Dr. Charles Smith of the Hospital
    for Sick Children in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    and described his preliminary observations to him.  At around 2:50&nbsp;p.m., Dr. Smith gave his
    opinion that Valin had been subjected to chronic abuse.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rasaiah called in Dr. Patricia Zehr to attend the
    autopsy.  Dr. Zehr was not a pathologist
    but rather a gynaecologist/obstetrician with expertise in child sexual
    abuse.  She observed the body and
    declared that this was one of the worst cases of child sexual abuse she had
    seen.  Events began to unfold very
    quickly thereafter.  Before the end of
    the post-mortem, Dr. Rasaiah told the police that he suspected Valin died between
    8:00 and 10:00 p.m. the previous evening and that death was due to homicidal
    asphyxiation.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These initial findings by Drs. Rasaiah, Smith and Zehr set
    in motion an inexorable rush to judgment that centred on Valin’s uncle, William
    Mullins-Johnson.  At 6:30 p.m., less than
    twelve hours after her parents had found Valin’s body, the police arrested Mr.&nbsp;Mullins-Johnson
    for first degree murder and aggravated sexual assault.  He was charged because he had been home,
    alone, baby-sitting Valin and her three-year-old brother John between 8:00 and
    10:00 p.m. on Saturday, June 26.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was eventually convicted of first degree murder, and
    his appeals to this court and the Supreme Court of Canada were dismissed:
    (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 117 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d [1998] 1 S.C.R. 977. He
    spent twelve years in jail from the time of his arrest until he was released in
    2005 on bail. From the very outset, Mr. Mullins-Johnson continually and
    vociferously protested his innocence but to no avail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is now clear that there is not and never was any reliable
    pathological evidence that Valin was sexually assaulted or otherwise abused during
    her short life and certainly not on the evening of her death.  It is also now clear that there is no
    evidence to support a finding of homicidal asphyxia, the cause of death proffered
    at trial. While the cause of Valin Johnson’s death remains undetermined, there
    is now no evidence to suggest it was the result of any crime. That Mr. Mullins-Johnson
    was arrested, convicted of first degree murder and spent twelve years in prison
    because of flawed pathology evidence is a terrible miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 6, 2007, the Minister of Justice directed a
    Reference to this court pursuant to s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to
    determine Mr.&nbsp;Mullins-Johnson’s case as if it were an appeal on the issue
    of fresh evidence.  On October 15, 2007,
    this court heard evidence from Dr. Michael Pollanen, the Chief Forensic
    Pathologist for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The appeal record also contains reports from
    five other leading experts in the field of pathology.  All six experts confirm that the medical
    evidence does not support the opinions provided at trial that Valin was
    sexually assaulted and murdered.  There
    is no other circumstantial evidence that the appellant committed a crime or,
    indeed, that a crime was committed at all.  To the contrary, an exhaustive review of the evidence from the night of
    June 26/27, 1993, including a forensic examination of Valin’s pyjamas,
    underwear and bedclothes and the clothes Mr. Mullins-Johnson wore that night, supports
    the appellant’s continued assertion that he did not assault or murder his
    niece. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Mullins-Johnson also testified before us.  He described in moving terms his activities
    on June 26 and 27, 1993, and the devastating impact his wrongful conviction has
    had on him and his family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the testimony and brief oral
    submissions from Mr. Lockyer for the appellant and Ms. Fairburn for the Crown,
    the court allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and entered an acquittal.
    We indicated we would provide reasons for our decision at a later date.  We reserved our decision for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, while the Crown agreed that there should be an
    acquittal in this case, it is important to explain, even if briefly, the reason
    for admitting the fresh evidence and entering an acquittal.  Second, in his argument, Mr. Lockyer
    suggested that this was a case where the court might want to go further and not
    merely enter an acquittal but make an order tantamount to a declaration of Mr.
    Mullins-Johnson’s factual innocence.  We
    deal now with those two matters.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    EXPERT EVIDENCE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of experts, including Drs. Rasaiah, Smith and
    Zehr, testified for the Crown at the trial.  Their unanimous view was that various findings from the examination of Valin’s
    body and the autopsy showed that she had been sexually assaulted over some
    period of time. Drs. Rasaiah and Smith also testified that Valin had been suffocated
    by her killer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence called two pathologists, but the evidence
    of the defence experts was not compelling and in some respects bolstered the
    Crown case.  The first expert, Dr. Rex Ferris,
    accepted that Valin had been subjected to chronic sexual abuse but suggested
    that she had not been sexually abused at the time of her death.  His evidence at trial that the cause of death
    was unexplained was inconsistent with a report he prepared prior to trial in
    which he suggested that Valin had been strangled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second expert, Dr. Fred Jaffe, testified that Valin
    had not been subjected to recent sexual abuse and that the cause of death could
    not be determined.  His evidence suffered
    from certain frailties and was not accepted by the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the appellant has always maintained
    his innocence. After the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed his appeal, he
    contacted the Association in Defence of the Wrongfully Convicted.  AIDWYC took up his case and retained an eminent
    pathologist, Professor Bernard Knight, to reinvestigate the case.  To do so, Professor Knight needed the various
    photographs, slides and other materials from the autopsy.  For reasons that are chronicled in the record,
    there was some delay in locating that material,   but the material was finally found and
    provided to Dr. Pollanen to be passed on to Professor Knight.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, Dr. Pollanen first did his own
    investigation.  He concluded that the
    various bruises and injuries said to be the result of abuse and murder were no
    more than the result of normal processes following death or were caused by
    procedures connected to the post-mortem investigation.  For example, the dilation of the child’s anus
    that was thought to be so indicative of anal penetration and chronic sexual
    assault (recall Dr. Zehr and her comment that this was one of the worst cases
    of child sexual abuse she had seen) is a normal finding in children after
    death.  The acute injuries to the child’s
    anus and vagina observed at the autopsy were the result of artefacts related to
    dissection or tissue preparation.  In
    other words, the findings said to establish sexual abuse were the result of
    natural changes to the body after death or of the post-mortem examination
    process itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the various bruises to Valin’s chest, neck
    and head, which were said to show that she had been physically abused during
    her life and manually suffocated, were the result of post-mortem artefacts
    related to lividity (the settling of the blood in the body after death).  The multiple bruises described by Dr. Rasaiah
    were no more than detailed descriptions of lividity marks.  They were not the product of a criminal
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Pollanen passed on the slides and other materials
    to Professor Knight.  He agreed with Dr.
    Pollanen.  In late 2005, Dr. Ferris was
    given the opportunity to meet with Dr. Pollanen and re-examine the
    materials.  In a report he provided in
    January 2006, Dr. Ferris reversed his trial opinion and agreed with the opinion
    of Dr. Pollanen that Valin had not been sexually assaulted and there was no
    pathological evidence of homicidal suffocation.  By January 2006, the Chief Coroner’s review of other cases in which Dr.
    Smith had provided an opinion was already underway.  The Office of the Chief Coroner asked three
    other leading expert pathologists to independently examine the Valin Johnson materials.  They came to the same conclusions as Drs.
    Pollanen and Ferris and Professor Knight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Crown agreed, this expert evidence is admissible
    as fresh evidence.  It clearly meets the
    traditional test for the admissibility of fresh evidence as set out by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Palmer</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193, and as most recently discussed by this court in the <i>Reference Re R. v. Truscott, </i>[2007] O.J. No. 3221.  The exceptionally credible and persuasive expert
    evidence that has come to light only since 2005 conclusively demonstrates that
    the experts who testified at trial that Valin was subjected to great violence
    before her death were wrong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the <i>Palmer</i> test were not strictly met, Doherty J.A.’s observation in <i>R. v. Maciel</i> (2007), 219 C.C.C. (3d) 516 (Ont.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>I also think that evidence should be received on
    appeal, regardless of whether it was available at trial, at least in the
    context of criminal cases where an appellant's liberty is at stake, if the
    evidence is sufficiently cogent to warrant an acquittal. It is not in the
    interests of justice to maintain a conviction where, on the totality of the
    evidence available to the appellate court, that court is satisfied that no
    reasonable jury could convict the appellant ….</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the submissions of Crown counsel about
    the fresh evidence as expressed in para. 12 of their factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    doubt that the new expert opinions in this case are credible and highly
    cogent.  They go to the very core of
    whether there was an offence committed in this case.  The opinions have been provided by some of
    the leading Canadian and international experts in forensic pathology and
    pathology.  The opinions not only have a
    profound impact on the reliability of the jury verdict reached at trial, it is
    submitted that they are dispositive of the result.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in their excellent factums the parties have
    fully reviewed for us the entire body of evidence aside from the expert
    evidence.  In short, without the expert
    evidence there is no case against the appellant and no evidence of a crime.  The non-expert evidence, if anything, is
    inconsistent with guilt and, again, is not indicative of a crime.  Now that the trial expert evidence has been
    completely discredited, there is no case against the appellant and he is clearly
    entitled to an acquittal. </p>

    conviction was the result of a rush to judgment based on flawed scientific
    opinion. With the entering of an acquittal, the appellant’s legal innocence has
    been re-established.  The fresh evidence
    is compelling in demonstrating that no crime was committed against Valin
    Johnson and that the appellant did not commit any crime.  For that reason an acquittal is the proper
    result.  </p>

    those based on the Crown having failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable

    is found not guilty.  There is no finding
    of factual innocence since it would not fall within the ambit or purpose of
    criminal law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just as the criminal trial is not a vehicle for
    declarations of factual innocence, so an appeal court, which obtains its
    jurisdiction from statute, has no jurisdiction to make a formal legal
    declaration of factual innocence.  The
    fact that we are hearing this case as a Reference under s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not expand
    that jurisdiction.  The terms of the
    Reference to this court are clear: we are hearing this case “as if it were an
    appeal”.  While we are entitled to
    express our reasons for the result in clear and strong terms, as we have done,
    we cannot make a formal legal declaration of the appellant’s factual innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the jurisdictional issue, there are
    important policy reasons for not , in effect, recognizing a third verdict,
    other than “guilty” or “not guilty”, of “factually innocent”.  The most compelling, and, in our view,
    conclusive reason is the impact it would have on other persons found not guilty
    by criminal courts.  As Professor Kent Roach
    observed in a report he prepared for the <i>Commission
    of Inquiry into Certain Aspects of the Trial and Conviction of James Driskell</i>,  “there is a genuine concern that
    determinations and declarations of wrongful convictions could degrade the
    meaning of the not guilty verdict” (p. 39).  To recognize a third verdict in the criminal trial process would, in
    effect, create two classes of people: those found to be factually innocent and
    those who benefited from the presumption of innocence and the high standard of
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing we have said in these reasons should be taken
    as somehow qualifying the impact of the fresh evidence.  That evidence, together with the other
    evidence, shows beyond question that the appellant’s conviction was wrong and
    that he was the subject of a terrible miscarriage of justice.  We conclude these reasons by paraphrasing
    what the president of the panel said to Mr. Mullins-Johnson at the conclusion
    of the oral argument after entering the verdict of acquittal: it is profoundly
    regrettable that as a result of what has been shown to be flawed pathological
    evidence Mr. Mullins-Johnson was wrongly convicted and has spent such a very
    long time in jail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We can only hope that these words, these reasons for
    judgment and the deep apology expressed by Ms. Fairburn on behalf of the
    Ministry of the Attorney General will provide solace to Mr. Mullins-Johnson, to
    his mother and to everyone who has been so terribly injured by these events.</p>

    on the afternoon of June 27, 1993.  Rather he consulted a different doctor at the Hospital for Sick

    time, prepared a report as to the cause of death and testified for the
