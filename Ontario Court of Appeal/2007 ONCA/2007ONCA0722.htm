line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Budd was tried on an indictment alleging three
    counts of sexual assault and three counts of sexual exploitation in relation to
    three sisters M.D., A.D. and K.D.  He was
    acquitted of the sexual assault charges on the basis that the sisters had
    consented to the sexual relations, but he was convicted of sexual exploitation
    on the two counts relating to A.B. and K.B. on the basis that a relationship of
    trust existed between him and the two young persons.  The sisters were all between the ages of
    fourteen and eighteen during the approximate four-year period of time when the
    offences occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was a successful and wealthy Bay Street
    Lawyer.  He was in his early forties when
    the offences occurred.  He met the D.
    family because they lived near his farm which he visited on weekends.  M.D. was sixteen, A.D. thirteen and K.D.
    twelve when they first met.  The
    appellant became very close to the family which consisted, during most of the
    period, of the mother D.D. and the three girls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship was so close that on more than one
    occasion the mother entrusted the safety and wellbeing of her daughters to the
    appellant’s care.  He accepted that
    responsibility and used those opportunities to develop and engage in long-term
    simultaneous sexual relationships with all three of them, albeit on a
    consensual basis on their part.  These
    occasions included a one-week trip alone with A.D. (with her parents’ consent)
    to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    and a trip (again
    with the parents’ consent) with K.D. and A.D. and his own sons to Disney World
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On one occasion, K.D. was permitted to come to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto on a shopping
    trip on the basis that she would be met by and stay with the appellant.  The trial judge found that K.D., her mother
    and the accused all knew that K.D.’s wellbeing and safety were vested in the
    appellant during this visit and that the trip only took place, to the knowledge
    of all of them, “because of the privileged position in which [the appellant]
    found himself and the reliance of the mother upon his integrity.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of Mr. Budd, Mr. Sandler made two
    submissions.  First, he argued that the
    trial judge misdirected himself as to the meaning of a “position of trust” and
    its application to the circumstances of this case, failing to recognize the
    central aspect of vulnerability in the establishment of such a relationship and
    relying upon an inappropriate definition of “trust” taken from the Wikipedia
    website.  Secondly, he contended that the
    trial judge erred because, having concluded that the evidence of the mother and
    the daughters was tainted by collusion and improper pressure from the family
    and the police, he nonetheless placed reliance on that evidence in convicting
    on the sexual exploitation counts.  We
    would not give effect to either submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to various authorities
    respecting the notion of “position of trust” as that phrase is used in s.
    153(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    including <i>R. v. Audet</i> (1996), 106
    C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) and the cases referred to therein.  We are satisfied that he correctly applied
    the principles laid down in those authorities, including the various
    definitions referred to therein which did not come from the Wikipedia website,
    and that he was entitled on the evidence to find, as he did, that a position of
    trust existed as between the appellant and A.D. and K.D.  There was ample evidence to support this
    finding.  It is obvious on the facts
    looked at overall that M.D. and K.D. were vulnerable in the circumstances.  They were young and impressionable and easily
    swayed by this debonair, dynamic individual.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also clear that the appellant was in a position
    vis-à-vis M.D. and K.D. that created the opportunity for all the persuasive and
    influencing factors that such an adult could hold over such young persons to
    come into play.  He was in a position of
    trust and consent was irrelevant.  He was
    obligated in the circumstances of this case to say “No”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify.  However, many of the events testified to by
    the complainants and their mother were not challenged on
    cross-examination.  We cannot agree that
    the trial judge’s finding that the evidence was tainted required that he reject
    all of the evidence outright.  His
    finding of fact on the sexual exploitation charges, as alluded to above, rely
    almost exclusively on evidence that was not disputed.  The reasons adequately express that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also seeks leave to appeal sentence, and
    appeals the nine-month custodial sentence imposed by the trial judge.  We see no error in principle on the part of
    the trial judge in imposing such a sentence and would not interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal as to conviction is therefore dismissed,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal as to sentence is dismissed
    as well.  </p>
