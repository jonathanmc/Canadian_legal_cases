    2004, the appellant was convicted of criminal harassment, attempting to
    obstruct justice and breach of recognizance and he was sentenced to eight
    months imprisonment. He appeals from the convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges arose from the appellant&#8217;s dealings
    with his former girlfriend. In 1999, the appellant was charged with two counts
    of threatening her. She did not attend court on the trial date, but a lawyer,
    Mr. Edward Sapiano, appeared on her behalf and confirmed that he had advised
    her that she was not required to attend the trial because she had not been
    subpoenaed. Mr. Sapiano also said that the complainant told him she was not
    afraid of the appellant and had not been influenced by him in deciding what to
    do. As the trial judge was not satisfied that police had made adequate efforts
    to subpoena the complainant, he refused to adjourn the trial and, as a result,
    the threatening charges were stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 2000, the complainant became friends with a
    Peel Regional Police officer, Adrian Adore. On March 1, 2001, the complainant
    called P.C. Adore after a confrontation between her and the appellant.&nbsp; According to P.C. Adore, he stopped the
    appellant while on uniform duty in a police cruiser and cautioned the appellant
    about his behaviour. According to the appellant, P.C. Adore forcibly removed
    him from his vehicle, detained him for at least forty-five minutes and searched
    him in public view. The appellant complained to the police. Following an
    internal investigation, P.C. Adore was disciplined for failing to keep proper
    notes of the stop, failing to report the stop and failing to have an officer
    dispatched who was not acquainted with the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of the internal investigation, the
    complainant (who by that time was P.C. Adore&#8217;s girlfriend) alleged that
    she did not attend the 1999 trial because the appellant threatened to harm her
    if she did. The complainant also alleged that the appellant had been harassing
    her over a period of almost three years. As the result of the
    complainant&#8217;s allegations, the charges in issue were laid on July 30,
    2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 4, 2003, defence counsel for the appellant,
    Mr. Howard Cohen, brought a motion in the Superior Court to adjourn the
    appellant&#8217;s upcoming trial date, or, in the alternative, to be removed as
    his counsel of record. The motion judge adjourned the trial, set a target trial
    date and stipulated that the new trial date was peremptory on the appellant
    with or without counsel. On the scheduled trial date, Mr. Cohen submitted (both
    in chambers and in court) that, as a result of the November 4, 2003
    endorsement, he was not on the record as counsel for the appellant. The trial
    judge agreed and the appellant proceeded to trial unrepresented. </p>

    appellant submits that in addition to the trial judge&#8217;s errors, Mr.
    Cohen&#8217;s representations to the trial judge constituted ineffective
    assistance of counsel.&nbsp; The
    appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence on appeal in relation to his
    ineffective assistance claim and also in relation to the second ground of
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledges that, in accordance with <i>R. v. Joanisse</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d)

    and order a new trial based on the first ground of appeal. In the
    circumstances, it is unnecessary that we address the remaining grounds of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i)
    Mr. Cohen&#8217;s initial involvement with the appellant&#8217;s case</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with the offences at issue in
    July 2001. Mr. Peter Derry acted as his counsel at the preliminary hearing and
    on his first several appearances in the Superior Court. On May 13, 2003, Mr.
    Derry obtained an order removing him as counsel of record. According to a
    letter sent by Mr. Cohen to the Crown&#8217;s office, the appellant retained
    Mr. Cohen to act on his behalf around May 21, 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After being retained, Mr. Cohen attended court and took
    other steps on the appellant&#8217;s behalf on several occasions. On July 28,
    2003, Mr. Cohen represented the appellant at a judicial pre-trial. On August 1,
    2003 he applied for and obtained an adjournment of the first trial date to
    September 15, 2003. Subsequently, he attended court when the September 15, 2003
    trial date was adjourned to December 8, 2003 because of outstanding disclosure.
    On September 15, 2003, he appeared on a bail review to obtain a variation of
    the appellant&#8217;s recognizance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the result of these attendances, there is no dispute
    that prior to the November 4, 2003 application Mr. Cohen was counsel of record
    for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)
    The abuse of process application </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 28, 2003, Mr. Cohen delivered an application
    seeking an order staying the charges as an abuse of process, or in the
    alternative, an order severing the criminal harassment and breach of
    recognizance charges from the remaining charges. An associate of Mr. Cohen, Ms.
    Lessard, filed an affidavit in support of the application in which she set out
    a chronology of the following events: the circumstances and disposition of the
    1999 charges; P.C. Adore&#8217;s March 1, 2001 stop of the appellant; the
    appellant&#8217;s complaint against P.C. Adore and the fact that an
    investigation was conducted and these charges laid as the result of the
    appellant&#8217;s complaint. A copy of the appellant&#8217;s complaint to the
    police was attached as an exhibit to Ms. Lessard&#8217;s affidavit. Ms. Lessard
    also stated:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It is [the
    appellant&#8217;s] firm belief that, as a result of the allegations made by him
    against Const. Adore and the subsequent investigation, the charges which are
    before the Court were laid by Peel Regional Police and prosecuted by the Crown
    and it is also [the appellant&#8217;s] firm belief that, the continued
    prosecution of the charges before the court is an abuse of process of the
    court, in that the laying of the new charges are oppressive and unfair, and
    were spearheaded by an improper motive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the application was delivered, Mr. Cohen was
    unable to comply with a direction from the court to deliver a factum by
    November 1, 2003 and it does not appear that further steps were taken in
    relation to the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii)
    The November 4, 2003 application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 4, 2003, Mr. Cohen applied on behalf of the
    appellant for an adjournment of the December 8, 2003 trial date or, in the
    alternative, for an order removing himself as counsel of record. The grounds
    for the application were that the appellant had experienced a serious financial
    setback and that he had agreed with Mr. Cohen that if he was unable to fulfill
    his ongoing retainer arrangements in a timely way, he would not oppose an
    application by Mr. Cohen to be removed from the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in paragraph 8 of the appellant&#8217;s
    supporting affidavit, the appellant stated that Mr. Cohen was willing to remain
    as counsel of record if an adjournment was granted. Further, in paragraph 9 of
    his affidavit, the appellant claimed that he did not feel he could present his
    position fully without the assistance of counsel because of the complexity of
    the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of his submissions on November 4,
    2003, Mr. Cohen advised the motion judge several times that he wished to remain
    on the record. Further, he said that there were three factors that would make
    it difficult for the appellant to represent himself. First, there was a pending
    abuse of process motion that was legally complex. Second, the allegations
    spanned a significant time frame. Third, the complainant was the
    appellant&#8217;s former girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e, which raised the potential
    for problems during cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cohen said that the reason for the application was &#8220;fully
    financial, there is no other reasons for this situation as it presently
    is.&#8221; In addition, he specifically stated that he would like to remain as
    counsel of record and suggested that a term be fashioned so that the appellant
    would be compelled to proceed on the new trial date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Crown vigorously opposed the adjournment
    request, the trial judge granted the adjournment &#8220;peremptory on the
    accused with or without counsel&#8221; and set a target trial date of May 17,
    2004 so that the Crown could confirm the availability of its witnesses. The
    target trial date was confirmed on December 5, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv)
    Difficulties in the solicitor-client relationship</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an affidavit filed in response to the allegation of
    ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Cohen indicates that when he took over
    the case &#8220;the developing defence theory &#8230; was that there was a
    potential abuse of process as a result of a police and civilian witness
    conspiracy to cover up the actions of Constable Adore towards [the
    appellant].&#8221;&nbsp; Mr. Cohen says
    that &#8220;[f]rom the outset, [the appellant] insisted that he had made a
    surreptitious videotape of Const. Adore&#8217;s traffic stop&#8221;. Mr. Cohen
    refers to numerous letters in which he asked the appellant for the videotape
    and later advised the appellant that the tape was essential to proceeding with
    an abuse of process motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, Mr. Cohen formed a suspicion that there was
    no videotape and that the appellant was &#8220;bluffing&#8221; him. In
    addition, the correspondence from Mr. Cohen to the appellant demonstrates that
    the appellant missed numerous meetings, often did not respond to attempts by
    Mr. Cohen to contact him, did not comply with a number of requests to sign a
    revised retainer agreement and avoided Mr. Cohen&#8217;s requests for the
    videotape.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Portions of a letter dated September 16, 2003 from Mr.
    Cohen to the appellant illustrate Mr. Cohen&#8217;s position:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>On May 21, 2003, we confirmed &#8230; that you would release the
    tape to me at some point so that I might view it. In my June 3, 2003 letter to
    you &#8230; I alerted you to the fact that we &#8220;reserve our right to
    decline the retainer at trial if we cannot satisfy ourselves that we are in an
    advantageous position to put forward a defence at trial&#8221;. On July 23,
    2003, I wrote again with respect to production of the tape to us&#8230;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>When I arrived in Court on Monday, September 15<sup>th</sup>,
    and you had in your possession what appeared to be a videocassette box, I asked
    for it to be given to me. You told me &#8220;You can&#8217;t have it&#8221;. I
    then realized that you had been misleading us all along in order to maintain
    control of the tape and, presumably, provide it to us at your discretion once
    the trial commenced. This, of course, created a fundamental conflict. The issue
    became whether, as an officer of the court, I could confidently articulate your
    position to the court based on the existing set of circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>&#8230;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>When I indicated to you that matters had developed to the point
    of a serious conflict between solicitor and client, you pointedly reminded me
    that &#8220;you&#8217;re on the record&#8221;. &#8230; I cannot be put in the
    position of making representations to the Court or challenging witnesses and
    making allegations of untruthfulness, unless I have taken reasonable precautions
    to ensure the veracity of those representations. In this case, of course, we
    had hoped to maximize our flexibility, and viewing the tape would have allowed
    me to make suggestions to witnesses that I would not be able to make unless I
    thereby obligated you to give evidence to challenge the Crown&#8217;s case. </p>

    and said it was urgent that the appellant provide him with the videotape so
    that he could complete the factum for the abuse of process motion and
    potentially &#8220;talk the Crown out of pressing forward with the
    prosecution.&#8221;&nbsp; Mr. Cohen also
    &#8220;urge[d] [the appellant] in the strongest of terms&#8221; to provide an
    additional retainer.&nbsp; Since Mr.
    Cohen had not heard from the appellant as of November 21, 2003, he suggested to
    the Crown that the matter be adjourned to December 5, 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 27, 2003, Mr. Cohen wrote to the appellant
    again and said that he had lost confidence in their ability to maintain
    &#8220;a functioning solicitor-client relationship,&#8221; and that if they
    could not resolve their differences they needed to &#8220;come to an agreement
    on a formula for disengagement.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant responded by letter dated December 1,
    2003. He expressed frustration at Mr. Cohen&#8217;s statement that he had lost
    confidence in the relationship and reiterated that he was not in funds at that
    point. He suggested that the next course of action should be a civil action
    rather than finalizing the abuse of process motion and asked Mr. Cohen to
    decide whether he intended to remain on the record or not. He said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Therefore, if it is
    your intention to be removed as solicitor on record, kindly advi[s]e the Crown
    of your position and inform [the Crown] that it is my intention to act as my
    own counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cohen wrote back on December 2, 2003 and said his
    loss of confidence was &#8220;directly connected to the nonsense over the provision
    of the videotape.&#8221; He said the tape was a necessary precondition to
    putting pressure on the Crown to have the charges withdrawn and to a civil
    suit. He concluded:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>If the tape
    doesn&#8217;t exist, which I suspect is the case, it would be a better course
    of action to tell me that, as opposed to essentially involving yourself in a
    process of attempting to &#8220;bluff&#8221; your own counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>You are required in

    remind him that they were to meet prior to Christmas &#8220;to agree on a move-forward

    18, 2004, the appellant said that he thought he had come up with about half of
    the necessary funds. The appellant also stated, &#8220;Worse case scenario, I

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The Court: I will

    Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>i) Did the trial judge
    err in holding that Mr. Cohen was not on the record as counsel for the
    appellant, in failing to adjourn the trial or in depriving the appellant of his
    right to be present at his trial?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that Mr. Cohen was not counsel of
    record on the trial date because the November 4, 2003 endorsement gave him the
    option of removing himself from the record at any time. In the alternative, the
    Crown submits that even if Mr. Cohen was on the record on the trial date, it
    was inevitable that Mr. Cohen would have been removed as counsel of record on
    that day because of a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship.&nbsp; In either case, the Crown contends that
    the appellant was not deprived improperly of the right to be represented by counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions. In our view, Mr.
    Cohen was on the record on the trial date and it is unlikely that he would have
    been successful in removing himself from the record had he applied that day.
    Accordingly, we accept the appellant&#8217;s submission that his right to
    representation by counsel was breached and that a new trial is required.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to properly interpret the November 4, 2003
    endorsement, it is necessary to consider it in the context of the application
    and submissions that were made. The November 4, 2003 application was made about
    one month prior to the third trial date that had been set in this matter,
    December 8, 2003. Not surprisingly, the Crown was opposed to the adjournment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As already noted, the November 4, 2003 application was
    primarily an application for an adjournment of the trial&#8212;the request to
    remove Mr. Cohen as counsel of record was a request for alternative
    relief.&nbsp; In his affidavit filed in
    support of the application, the appellant deposed that Mr. Cohen was willing to
    remain as counsel of record if an adjournment was granted. Mr. Cohen confirmed
    that position in his submissions to the motion judge. After noting that the
    cause of the situation was &#8220;fully financial,&#8221; Mr. Cohen said: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>My submission is
    that <i>I&#8217;d like to obtain an
    adjournment and remain as counsel of record, and perhaps fashion some sort of
    term whereby [the appellant] would be perhaps compelled to proceed on a new
    trial date</i>, which should give us the opportunity to put this thing together
    in a way that&#8217;s functional for myself included. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, when asked what length of an adjournment he
    was seeking, Mr. Cohen said: &#8220;I would say five months should be
    sufficient, based on what [the appellant] and I have discussed are his
    capabilities.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed in this context, in our opinion, the motion
    judge did exactly what Mr. Cohen asked: he granted a five-month adjournment of
    the trial date, he did not make an order removing Mr. Cohen as counsel of
    record, and he fashioned a term making it clear that the appellant would be
    required to proceed on the new trial date, whether Mr. Cohen remained as his
    counsel at that time or not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, we consider it noteworthy that neither
    the Crown nor Mr. Cohen asked the motion judge to make it a term of any adjournment
    that Mr. Cohen be removed as the appellant&#8217;s counsel of record.
    Accordingly, in order to interpret the November 4, 2003 endorsement as removing
    Mr. Cohen as counsel of record, it would be necessary to conclude that the
    motion judge made that order essentially of his own motion and without giving
    Mr. Cohen a chance to respond. In our view, this does not make sense. What does
    make sense is that the motion judge wished to ensure that the appellant would
    be required to proceed on the next trial date even if Mr. Cohen was <i>later</i> removed as his counsel of record.
    Accordingly, he made it clear that the new trial date was peremptory on the
    appellant <i>with or without counsel</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cohen&#8217;s statements to the trial judge in
    court on May 18, 2004 are unfortunate. He mischaracterized the November 4, 2003
    application as an application to remove himself as counsel of record when, in
    fact, that was an alternative claim for relief. In the light of this inaccurate
    submission, it is not surprising that the trial judge drew the conclusion he
    did.&nbsp; However, the trial judge
    should have asked the appellant for submissions before making that
    determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in the Crown&#8217;s submission that
    the November 4, 2003 endorsement gave Mr. Cohen the option of removing himself
    from the record at some point in the future. On a plain reading of the November
    4, 2003 endorsement, it does not say that. For the reasons set out above, we
    interpret the November 4, 2003 endorsement as meaning that the trial date was
    adjourned and that the appellant would be required to proceed on the new trial
    date even if Mr. Cohen was later removed as counsel of record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in our view, it does not make sense that the
    motion judge would make an order giving counsel the option of removing himself
    from the record at some future date, particularly without a term requiring him
    to advise all parties and the court of his decision in writing. Without such a
    term, the court and the Crown would have been left in a state of ignorance
    concerning whom to contact about the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, unless new counsel goes on the
    record, removal from the record in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    requires a court order<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and the making of such an order involves the exercise of judicial discretion
    based on the presenting circumstances. While there may have been no dispute on
    November 4, 2003 that Mr. Cohen should be removed from the record if the
    December 8, 2003 trial date remained in place, that does not imply that there
    would be no dispute that such an order would be appropriate on some future date
    when circumstances may have changed. Given this factor, we see no merit in the
    suggestion that the motion judge in this case intended to make an order that
    would apply in unknown future circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the question of whether Mr. Cohen could have
    obtained an order removing him from the record on May 18, 2004, we conclude
    that it is likely that he could not. There are two bases on which Mr. Cohen
    might have applied for an order removing him as counsel of record: i) financial
    reasons, and ii) a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, it was too late for Mr. Cohen to obtain
    an order removing him from the record for financial reasons. In <i>R. v. Clement </i>(2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d)
    219 at para. 16 (Ont. C.A.), this court, relying on rule 2.09(5) of the Rules
    of Professional Conduct of the Law Society of Upper Canada, said: &#8220;As a
    general rule, where a lawyer has agreed to act in a criminal matter and the
    trial is about to start, counsel is expected to remain on the record whether or
    not his client is able to pay his fees.&#8221; Rule 2.09(5) of the Rules of
    Professional Conduct provides:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Where a lawyer has
    agreed to act in a criminal case and where the date set for trial is not far
    enough removed to enable the client to obtain another lawyer or to enable
    another lawyer to prepare adequately for trial and an adjournment of the trial
    date cannot be obtained without adversely affecting the client&#8217;s
    interests, the lawyer who agreed to act may not withdraw because of non-payment
    of fees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, rule 25.02 of the Criminal Proceedings Rules
    states that notice of an application for removal must be brought &#8220;as soon
    as is reasonably practicable and sufficiently in advance of the scheduled date
    of trial.&#8221;&nbsp; Although this is a
    procedural rule, it demonstrates the underlying policy rationale against
    lawyers withdrawing at a point that may be harmful to their clients&#8217;
    interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, while it is undoubtedly true that the
    appellant was aware that he had not paid Mr. Cohen and therefore that Mr. Cohen
    may have been unwilling to act, it was Mr. Cohen&#8217;s responsibility to
    bring the issue to a head in sufficient time to allow the appellant to obtain
    alternate counsel or to prepare to represent himself. In our view, Mr. Cohen
    failed to give the appellant timely notice of either the fact that he no longer
    considered himself counsel of record, or that he intended to apply to be
    removed from the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evidence before us, the first notice the
    appellant received that Mr. Cohen would not be appearing for trial on May 17,
    2004 was the May 6, 2004 telephone call from Mr. Cohen&#8217;s assistant. In
    this regard, Mr. Cohen suggested in cross-examination that he gave the
    appellant notice that he was no longer counsel of record as a result of the
    November 4, 2003 endorsement by way of a letter dated December 2, 2003 advising
    the appellant that he (the appellant) had to attend court on December 5, 2003.
    We reject this suggestion. If Mr. Cohen intended to take the position with the
    appellant that he was no longer on the record as a result of the November 4,
    2003 endorsement, he should have said so explicitly and in writing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in our opinion, it is clear from Mr.
    Cohen&#8217;s February 9, 2004 letter to the Crown that he had at least some
    concerns about the meaning of the November 4, 2003 endorsement. In these
    circumstances, even if Mr. Cohen had taken a clear position with the appellant
    that he was no longer on the record, it was incumbent on Mr. Cohen, at a
    minimum, to advise the appellant that there could be uncertainty about the
    issue.&nbsp; The better course would have
    been to apply for an order expressly removing himself as counsel of record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such steps, in our view, Mr. Cohen
    waited too long to give the appellant notice of his intention not to appear as
    counsel at trial and the trial date was simply too late to bring an application
    to have himself removed for financial reasons. The matter was marked peremptory
    with or without counsel and May 17, 2004 was the fourth trial date. In these circumstances,
    there was no realistic prospect of an adjournment to obtain alternate counsel.
    While it is true that the appellant expressed on at least two occasions his
    willingness to act for himself, he was entitled to more than eleven days notice
    that Mr. Cohen did not intend to appear on his behalf, and he was entitled to
    receive the disclosure package more than five days prior to trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching these conclusions, we recognize that the
    appellant was a difficult client who did not fully fund Mr. Cohen&#8217;s
    retainer and who may have been avoiding Mr. Cohen for that reason. However, as
    we have said, it was Mr. Cohen&#8217;s obligation as counsel of record to take
    steps to bring the situation to a head. In our view, he was not entitled to
    wait until the eve of trial to advise the appellant that, in his view, he was
    no longer on the record, nor was he entitled to wait until the trial date to
    apply for an order removing him as counsel of record because his fees remained
    unpaid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we are not persuaded that the record
    demonstrates a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship such that an
    order removing Mr. Cohen as counsel of record would have been granted. The
    Crown submits that the circumstances surrounding the appellant&#8217;s failure
    to produce the videotape relating to the traffic stop would have justified such
    an order. We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cohen asked the appellant for the videotape to
    support the appellant&#8217;s application for a stay of proceedings based on an
    abuse of process. However, even assuming that the videotape existed and
    supported the appellant&#8217;s description of the traffic stop, it is not
    clear how that evidence would have given rise to a viable claim for a stay. In
    that regard, Mr. Cohen seemed to acknowledge on his cross-examination that the
    abuse of process motion had little prospect of success, but rather was
    undertaken for tactical reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp; If
    the tape depicted what it was supposed to depict, what you heard it was going
    to depict, did you have a realistic chance of winning the abuse of process motion?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp; I
    had the beginnings of it &#8230; But, that is really all we had, was the
    ability to start down that road &#8230;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.&nbsp; And,
    [the appellant] also testified that you said that it was not likely that the
    abuse of process motion would be successful, but that it was being brought for
    tactical reasons, to paraphrase.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.&nbsp; I
    &#8211; it sounds like the type of thing I would say, knowing what the law in
    Canada is, and knowing that a stay for all charges would be a fantastic result
    in light of all the potential evidence that could be called, assuming that he
    had a tape that depicted what he said was on the tape.&nbsp; But, I, of course, attempted to use
    &#8211; when I saw that we were proceeding down the bluff side of it, I was
    trying to hold it together for him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we do not see how failure to
    produce the videotape could give rise to a breakdown in the solicitor-client
    relationship in and of itself.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although the videotape issue had been brewing
    for some time as of the November 4, 2003 adjournment request, Mr. Cohen
    expressly advised the court on that date that the basis for the application was
    &#8220;fully financial&#8221; and that there was no other reason for the
    application. While it is clear that at least by December 2, 2003, Mr. Cohen
    suspected that the appellant was &#8220;bluffing&#8221; him about the existence
    of the videotape, Mr. Cohen did not advise the appellant that he could no
    longer represent him as a result. On the contrary, Mr. Cohen continued to urge
    the appellant to contact him so that they could work things out. Similarly, in
    suggesting that the appellant would be better off to tell him if there was no
    videotape, Mr. Cohen did not either say or imply that he could no longer
    represent the appellant if that were the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering the record as a whole, it appears that
    without the videotape, at worst, Mr. Cohen may have been unable to proceed with
    a motion that he considered had questionable merit. Apart from that, we are not
    persuaded that there is any clear indication in the record that the
    solicitor-client relationship was affected by the appellant&#8217;s failure to
    produce the videotape. While the issue of whether counsel should be removed
    from the record is a matter of discretion, in light of the foregoing
    circumstances, we consider it unlikely that Mr. Cohen would have been
    successful had he brought a motion on May 18, 2004 to be removed as counsel of
    record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the appellant was required to represent
    himself at trial even though he had counsel of record, we conclude that his
    right to be represented by counsel was violated and that a new trial is
    required. Like <i>R. v. McCallen</i> (1999),
    131 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    this is not a case where the appellant must demonstrate actual prejudice in
    order to obtain an order for a new trial. Rather, a new trial is required
    &#8220;to protect and vindicate the right that has been breached and to ensure
    the perception of fairness of the proceeding&#8221;: <i>McCallen</i> at paras. 86-87, referring to <i>R. v. Tran</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 218 (S.C.C.). </p>
