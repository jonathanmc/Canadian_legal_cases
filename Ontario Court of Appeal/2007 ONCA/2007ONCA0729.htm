line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant Correena Walford was 15 3/4 years old when she went down the slide
    her parents had just installed beside their 4-foot, aboveground, backyard pool,
    hit her chin on the bottom of the pool and broke her neck. The trial judge
    dismissed the appellants’ claims for negligence and failure to warn against a
    number of defendants, including the respondent pool store that sold the mother
    some fittings for the slide and assured her that installing the slide with her
    pool would be “okay” and “no problem”. The appellant Correena Walford was
    rendered quadriplegic by the accident. The trial judge assessed her damages at over
    $5 million<b>.</b> There is no appeal from
    that assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The sole
    issue of liability on the appeal is whether the pool store breached a duty of
    care to the appellants by telling the mother that it was “okay” and that there
    would be “no problem” with installing the slide on their 4-foot-deep aboveground
    pool, without warning her of the potential for catastrophic injury, and if so,
    whether that breach caused or contributed to the damage that the appellant
    Correena Walford suffered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In my view,
    the trial judge erred in finding no breach of duty by the respondent for
    failure to warn and no negligent misrepresentation, and for finding that
    Correena Walford’s negligence was the sole cause of the accident.  For the following reasons, I would allow the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts
    from the Reasons of the Trial Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Walfords had owned at least three aboveground,
    backyard pools, the most recent of which at the date of the accident, July 12
    1996, was the Mardi Gras pool they bought second-hand and installed in 1994. It
    was 16 feet wide, 24 feet long, and 4 feet deep. Correena’s grandfather had
    lived with the family until his death in April 1996 and expressed the wish that
    the family obtain a slide for the pool. The appellant Mrs. Marion Walford wanted
    to fulfill that wish using funds from her father’s estate. She believed that a
    slide could be installed with her family’s pool because the cover of the <i>Mardi Gras Installation Instructions</i> booklet that had accompanied the pool featured an illustration of a child using
    a slide installed at the end of the pool. However, she sought further
    assurances that a slide was in fact appropriate for a 4-foot-deep pool.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She first contacted Pioneer Pools at their
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Barton Street
    store, where she had been a customer for two years. She bought chemicals and
    other pool supplies for her pool there, and a representative had attended her
    pool to assist with the installation of a new vinyl liner and, on another
    occasion, with an algae problem. Mrs. Walford relied on the expertise of the
    store’s staff to keep her pool in proper working order and trusted their
    advice. When she first called about a slide, it was to inquire whether a slide
    was available for a 4-foot pool. She was told that it was, but there was no
    floor model, the cost was over $1,000, and it had to be ordered from the
    manufacturer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Walford next called the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton building department, which told her
    either that they did not regulate slides or that there was no city regulation
    prohibiting the use of a water slide with a 4-foot pool.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She subsequently saw a classified ad that Kevin Boyle
    had placed in <i>The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton Spectator </i>offering a 10-foot
    pool slide manufactured by Jacuzzi for $350. She called the number and asked
    the man she spoke with whether the slide could be used with a 4-foot pool. He
    responded that he did not see a problem. She again called the City of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton building
    department and spoke to a different official who gave her the same response as
    before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before going to see the Boyles’ slide, Mrs. Walford
    made two further inquiries for information. First she called her Pioneer Pools
    store and spoke to a female employee. Mrs. Walford told the employee about Mr.
    Boyle’s advertisement and asked whether it was okay to use the slide with a 4-foot
    pool. The Pioneer Pools employee said that she could not see a problem. Mrs.
    Walford then called another pool shop, Acorn Pools, whose employee also could
    not foresee a problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, Mrs. Walford went with her neighbour, Judy
    Dunn, to the Boyles’ residence and purchased the slide for $225. The slide was
    quite old and had some broken parts. Mrs. Walford testified that Kevin Boyle’s
    father, William, told her that it had been mounted on a 4-foot pool similar to
    hers. It turned out that the Boyles had purchased the slide 15 years earlier at
    a garage sale and that they had never installed it. The claim against Kevin and
    William Boyle for negligent misrepresentation was dismissed at trial and no
    appeal was taken from that part of the judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After purchasing the slide, Mrs. Walford loaded it into
    her van and drove directly to the Barton Street Pioneer Pools store. There she
    spoke with the store manager, Sumera Fraser, whom Mrs. Walford had dealt with
    before. Mrs. Walford asked Ms. Fraser to inspect the slide, which Mrs. Walford
    and Ms. Dunn pulled partway out of the van. Mrs.&nbsp;Walford asked Ms. Fraser
    whether it was all right to use this slide with her 4-foot pool and she was
    told again that there would be no problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The slide’s installation required securing the three
    metal legs that support the front portion of the slide with mountings that Mrs.
    Walford purchased from the store. Ms.&nbsp;Fraser also pointed out that the
    tubing that supplies water to the two jets that lubricate the slide was
    missing, and referred Mrs. Walford to another Pioneer Pools store on
    Highway&nbsp;53 for those parts. Mrs. Walford went to the Highway 53 Pioneer
    Pools store the next day. The first clerk she spoke to there directed her to an
    older male employee at the back of the store who was knowledgeable about the
    tubing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Walford described the slide as a 10-foot-long
    slide manufactured by Jacuzzi
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ,
    as it had been advertised. Although the slide was 10 feet in length, it was 7
    feet, 6 inches high measured from the deck to the top of the handrail, 6 feet, 3
    inches from the seat to the deck, and 6 feet, 6 inches from the seat to the
    water. The older male employee supplied Mrs. Walford with two kinds of tubing
    and assured her that one would fit her slide. Mrs. Walford again asked if it
    was all right to use the slide with her 4-foot-deep pool and he told her that
    it would be “okay.” He also drew her a sketch that showed how the mountings
    were to be installed on the deck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Walford testified that she felt it was important
    that employees of Pioneer Pools see the slide. She said that although the older
    male employee at the Highway 53 store did not see the slide, he appeared to be
    knowledgeable and she relied on his expertise. She testified that had she been
    told by Pioneer Pools that it was not safe to use the slide, she would not have
    installed it, even though she had already bought it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During all of her inquiries, Mrs. Walford did not
    specifically ask whether it would be <i>safe</i> to install or use the slide with a 4-foot-deep pool. However, the trial judge
    found that her concern was with the slide’s safety. Nor was there any
    suggestion in the evidence that anyone’s response to her inquiries would have
    been different had she used the word “safe” rather than “okay.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That evening, the Walfords installed the slide on the
    deck of the pool. The next day, Correena and her next door neighbour, Shauwn
    Dunn, went swimming in the pool and used the slide. Mrs. Walford was very
    safety conscious and had firm rules for the use of the pool, including no
    diving, no running, and mandatory use of the ladder to get in and out. There
    was a “no diving” sign in a window of the house facing the pool. Either Mr. or
    Mrs. Walford was always present when the pool was in use. Before the children
    were permitted to use the slide, Mrs. Walford gathered them together and
    instructed them on the rules for the use of the slide. Her rules included: no
    pushing; no running; one person had to be down the slide before the next one
    started up the ladder; no one underneath the slide when one person was going
    down; and descending the slide only “feet first”, or as Correena testified, “on
    their bums.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Correena heeded her mother’s directions and slid in a
    seated position the first time down, but the second time she was crouched over
    her knees. She slid this way because she thought it would be fun and she had
    done it with no restrictions on waterslides such as those at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s Wonderland and other large
    parks. Mrs. Walford watched Correena go down the slide the first time, but was
    distracted talking to a neighbour and did not see Correena slide the second
    time. When Correena entered the water head first, she went forward fast and her
    chin hit the bottom of the pool. She felt her body float to the top and she
    could not move. She had been rendered quadriplegic. </p>

    Pools; Kevin and William Boyle; Esther Williams Pools of Canada Inc, the
    manufacturer of the Mardi Gras pool; and Jacuzzi Canada Ltd., the manufacturer
    of the slide. The trial judge found no liability on the part of any of the defendants,
    either because they were not negligent, or because their negligence did not
    cause the accident. The appellants appealed only against Pioneer Pools.  </p>

    installing a slide on a 4-foot-deep pool was “okay,” Pioneer Pools’ employees
    met the prevailing standard of care as set out in the U.S. Consumer Product
    Safety Standards (CPSS). The CPSS criteria for pool slides came into effect on

    deep, a slide should be no higher than 6 feet, 6 inches from the deck to the
    seating surface and restricted to use by children under 13 years old. For a water
    depth of 4 feet or more, “unrestricted slides” may be used. For slides 7 feet, 6
    inches or less in height, the minimum water depth is 4 feet.</p>

    question whether it was “safe” to use a water slide 6 feet, 3 inches above the
    deck and 10 feet in length with a 4-foot-deep aboveground pool. However, he
    also agreed with Pioneer Pools’ submission that the proper answer to that

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Misrepresentations
    of safety are a common cause of personal injury and a familiar form of
    negligence which the law has long considered actionable, as in the case of
    dangerous premises and products concealing a trap or flaw beneath a misleading
    appearance of safety. Scant, if any, attention has been paid in these and other
    contexts to the fact that the gist of complaint against the defendant is that
    he created the risk by misrepresentation rather than by failing to inspect or
    actually digging the pitfall. Admittedly, often enough the misrepresentation consists,
    not in something he said, but in his failing to say anything at all (that is to
    warn); but this should matter no more than whether communication was by gesture
    (like waving a motorist over a level crossing into the path of an approaching

    Husky v. Saint John Shipbuilding</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210 at 1229, the Supreme
    Court described the law on duty to warn as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The law may be
    simply stated.&nbsp;Manufacturers and suppliers are required to warn all those
    who may reasonably be affected by potentially dangerous products:&nbsp;<i>Lambert
    v. Lastoplex Chemicals Co.</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 569, and <i>Hollis v. Dow Corning
    Corp</i>., [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634.&nbsp;This duty extends even to those persons
    who are not party to the contract of sale: <i>Rivtow Marine Ltd. v. Washington
    Iron Works</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 1189.&nbsp;The potential user must be reasonably
    foreseeable to the manufacturer or supplier—manufacturers and suppliers … do
    not have the duty to warn the entire world about every danger that can result
    from improper use of their product.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The duty to warn of potentially dangerous products
    applies only to dangers that are not obvious. In <i>Schulz v. Leeside Developments Ltd.</i> (1978), 90 D.L.R. (3d) 98, an
    18-year-old boy rented a motor boat from the defendant. The teenager decided to
    climb over the windshield of the boat while the boat was travelling at full
    speed, and ride on top of the bow of the boat while holding onto a rope that
    was tied to a cleat on the bow. When the boat suddenly lurched, the boy fell
    into the water, came into contact with the propeller, and was rendered paralyzed.
    The British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the danger of riding on top of
    the bow of a speeding motor boat was an obvious one. It adopted the statement
    on “obvious dangers” from William L. Prosser’s <i>Handbook of the Law of Torts</i>, 4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th</span> ed. (St. Paul, Minn.: West

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>One limitation
    commonly placed upon the duty to warn, or for that matter the seller’s entire
    liability, is that he is not liable for dangers that are known to the user, or
    are obvious to him, or are so commonly known that it can reasonably be assumed
    that the user will be familiar with them. Thus there is certainly no usual duty
    to warn the purchaser that a knife or an axe will cut, a match will take fire,
    dynamite will explode, or a hammer may mash a finger. </p>

    using a product is not obvious and a consumer seeks reassurance from a merchant
    concerning the safety or propriety of a product, the answer must not be
    misleading.<b> </b>This is essentially a
    claim in negligent misrepresentation, augmented in the circumstances where a
    potentially dangerous product is involved, by the duty to warn. The five
    elements of a claim for negligent misrepresentation are: 1) a duty of care
    based on a “special relationship”, 2) a misleading representation, 3)
    negligence in making the misrepresentation, 4) reasonable reliance on the
    representation, 5) damage caused by the reliance. See<i> Queen v. Cognos,</i> [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87 at 110.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acknowledged that there may be a
    sufficiently close relationship between Mrs. Walford and Pioneer Pools to
    create a duty of care. I agree that there was such a relationship and that such
    a duty existed here. Mrs. Walford was a two-year customer of Pioneer Pools for
    parts and servicing and she trusted the store for help and advice regarding matters
    relating to her pool, including the installation of a slide. She had originally
    enquired about purchasing her slide from her Pioneer Pools store. It is plain
    on the evidence that there was a relationship of proximity between Mrs. Walford
    and Pioneer Pools that created a duty of care. As the trial judge observed
    later in his reasons when he explained why there was no similar relationship
    between Mrs. Walford and the Boyles, the men from whom she bought the slide,
    Mrs. Walford did not rely on them because she consulted with two pool supply
    businesses, “experts in the field”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As McGarry J. stated in <i>Amin (Litigation guardian of) v. Klironomous</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 826
    at para. 28, “it is clear that both the distributor and retailer have a duty to
    warn the consumer of inherent dangers with respect to the products they
    distribute or sell.” In this case, although Pioneer Pools did not sell the
    slide to Mrs. Walford because they did not have one in stock and a new one would
    have been too expensive for her, they sold her parts for the slide she did buy,
    gave her instructions on how to install it, and offered her specific
    reassurances about installing it on her 4-foot-deep pool.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore agree with the trial judge that a <i>prima facie </i>duty of care arose when
    Pioneer Pools’ employees assured Mrs. Walford that her slide was appropriate
    for use with a 4-foot pool, in the course of selling her the parts that would
    enable such use. There are no relevant policy reasons in the circumstances of
    this case to negate this <i>prima facie</i> duty. In the context of negligent misrepresentation, there was a special
    relationship of trust and confidence between Mrs. Walford and Pioneer Pools,
    based on their history, together with the fact that she specifically sought
    their advice as pool experts. (See <i>Cognos</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 116–18.)</p>

    Pioneer Pools and Mrs. Walford, the trial judge turned to the standard of care.
    He was satisfied that the respondent met the standard of care when its
    employees told Mrs. Walford, in response to her questions, that it was “okay”
    or “no problem” to install a 10-foot long slide with a 4-foot-deep aboveground

    judge made a palpable and overriding error when he said that Mrs. Walford “did
    not seek any advice about warnings or safety precautions” from the respondent. There
    is no dispute that Mrs. Walford did not testify that she specifically used the
    word “safety”. Nevertheless, the trial judge had no doubt that Mrs. Walford’s
    concern was with safety. The trial judge made no finding whether Pioneer Pools’
    employees objectively understood that Mrs. Walford was asking about safety, nor
    was there any evidence about that. He also made no finding that they would not have
    reasonably understood her to be asking about safety. However, he concluded that
    the answer Pioneer Pools’ employees gave Mrs. Walford would have met the
    standard of care had she specifically asked about safety. </p>

    supplies whether it is “okay” to install a slide with a pool of a specified
    shallow depth, it is clear that the customer’s concern is safety. There is
    really no other issue. The question is, once the vendor decides to answer the
    customer’s question, does the standard of care in this context encompass a duty
    to warn the customer of the safety issues relevant to installing a pool slide with
    a 4-foot-deep pool? Or, put another way, was Pioneer Pools negligent when its
    employees told Mrs. Walford that it was “okay” or “no problem” to install her
    slide on her pool, without any qualification or warning about the dangers of
    using such a slide?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of care depends on the circumstances and
    the context in which the duty arises. In this case, Mrs. Walford was asking for
    advice and assurance that it was appropriate for her to install a slide on a 4-foot-deep
    aboveground pool. She asked Pioneer Pools’ employees about this three times:
    when she bought fittings for the slide, when she obtained tubing and
    instructions for the slide’s proper installation, and when she first called the
    store to inquire about buying a new slide for her pool. </p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent held itself out as having expertise
    regarding pools and pool accessories. Mrs. Walford trusted the respondent. No
    one from Pioneer Pools testified at the trial. The only evidence from Pioneer
    Pools was excerpts from the examination for discovery of Ms. Fraser, the
    manager of the Barton Street Pioneer Pools store, that were read into the
    record by the appellants’ counsel. Ms. Fraser said she did not remember Mrs.
    Walford, but she had a memory of two women coming with a slide in a van and
    asking for tubing. She did not recall her conversation with them. She testified
    that she had no training regarding the propriety of using a slide with a 4-foot
    pool. The only information the store had on site regarding slides was a pool
    technician’s manual and a brochure on the slide model that Pioneer Pools
    distributed. Nevertheless she stated that when she sold pool supplies to
    individuals, she would give them the benefit of her knowledge and experience in
    respect of those supplies.</p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    owner’s manual, which were attached to the report of the appellants’ expert
    witness, for other evidence of the prevailing safety standard. The Jacuzzi
    Canada brochure, dated March 1, 1973, refers to its slides, including the model
    Mrs. Walford purchased, as “safe and serviceable.” The minimum recommended
    water depth for that model is 4 feet. It is described as suitable for adults
    and children. The owners’ manual, dated February 1, 1976, refers to the same 4-foot
    minimum water depth and recites three “safety tips”, which are the same as those
    found on the faded label attached to the slide: <i>“1. Enter water feet first; 2. One person only on the slide at time;
    and 3. Never stand going down slide”.</i> The trial judge concluded that
    Jacuzzi Canada’s printed information in 1996 would not have said anything
    different from the CPSS. </p>

    also referred to the American National Standard for Aboveground/Ongound
    Residential Swimming Pools, a voluntary standard sponsored by the National Spa
    and Pool Institute (NSPI). The trial judge determined that the NSPI standard
    was not applicable for several reasons. Little turns on this finding by the
    trial judge because the CPSS standard that the trial judge recognized as the
    relevant standard contains extensive safety precautions for pool slides beyond
    the pool depth requirements that were the only ones he referred to.</p>

line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on to discuss the features of the
    Walfords’ pool. He found on a balance of probabilities that the pool’s depth
    was in excess of 4 feet, based on evidence that the pool bottom had been
    excavated a few inches when it was installed and that Mrs. Walford topped up
    the pool every day. He concluded that the depth of the water in the pool therefore
    exceeded 4 feet and consequently could accommodate “unrestricted slides” under
    the standard promulgated by the CPSS. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This finding appears to have been the principal basis for
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the assurances given Mrs. Walford by Pioneer
    Pools’ employees  accorded with the CPSS requirements
    and therefore met its standard of care. However, the trial judge misinterpreted
    the CPSS slide requirements regarding pool depth. Under the CPSS, the term
    “unrestricted slide” means a slide that can be used by persons older than 13
    years of age, rather than a slide of any height. Instead, for pools of between 4
    to 5 feet in depth, the CPSS restricts slides to a maximum height of 7 feet, 6
    inches. As noted above, for pools between 3 and 4 feet in depth, the CPSS
    standard prohibits the use of slides taller than 6 feet, 6 inches, which was
    the height of the Walfords’ slide, and prohibits any use by persons over 13 years
    of age. Furthermore, it does not seem physically possible that either topping
    up or digging an excavation for an aboveground pool—essentially a rectangular
    box with a single open face—whose depth dimension is 4 feet could result in a
    water depth of over 4 feet. </p>

line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, whether the pool’s actual depth was a few
    inches deeper than 4 feet is not relevant to Pioneer Pools’ failure to warn.
    Because Mrs. Walford always described her pool as a 4-foot pool when she was
    talking to the Pioneer Pools’ employees, the advice they gave her related to a 4-foot
    pool and not a deeper one. </p>

    accommodate a slide, the trial judge referred to the evidence of Frederick
    Schall, the senior vice-president of Esther Williams, the company that
    manufactured the appellants’ Mardi Gras pool. His evidence was that a slide
    would have been appropriate for the Mardi Gras pool model that had a 7-foot, 6-inch
    deep end known as a “hopper”. He believed that the picture on the Walfords’ pool
    manual that displayed a pool with a slide at the end was intended to show a
    hopper pool, rather than a pool like the Walfords’, with a uniform 4-foot depth.</p>

    trial judge was entitled to use the CPSS as the relevant standard of care.
    However, in doing so, he erred when he misapprehended the standard by referring
    only to the requirements governing minimum pool depth. Although the CPSS
    permitted the installation of a slide on a 4-foot-deep pool, that permission
    was qualified in the CPSS by many safety requirements concerning the risk of
    serious injury and instructions for reducing that risk. The standard contains
    an extensive discussion of the dangers of swimming pool slides. </p>

    Safety Commission, which was charged with developing a mandatory consumer
    product safety standard for swimming pool slides under the authority of the
    United States Consumer Product Safety Act. Under the heading “Description of
    the Standard,” the Commission explains its goals as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The standard
    addresses the risk of quadriplegia and paraplegia by (1) specifying that slides
    must impart a low angle of attack of the slider into the water, (2)
    establishing slide height versus water depth relationships which are to be
    conveyed to the consumer by intended use criteria that must accompany the
    slides, and (3) requiring mandatory permanent, and explicit signs on all sides
    to (a) restrict adult-sized persons from the use of slides placed in shallow
    water, (b) inform users of the proper body position to use as they go down the
    slide, and (c) inform slide users of the injury potential that exists if slide
    use warnings are ignored.</p>

    Commission discusses the views of several commentators. The comments under the
    heading “Mode of Injury” are instructive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Several commentators
    argue that the warning signs and intended use instructions provided in the
    proposed standard do not sufficiently explain the nature of the mechanism that
    produces the serious injuries of paraplegia and quadriplegia as a result of
    belly slides. Briefly, these injuries appear to be caused by a forward flipping
    of the body that may result in the forceful impact of the top or rear of the
    head with the pool bottom. The Commission agrees that the previously published
    signs and instructions allow consumers to believe that the danger involves a
    straight line impact with the bottom as with a shallow dive. What the consumer
    may not realize, however, is that the unexpected flipping motion will subject
    the slider to sudden forces beyond his or her control. The awareness of this
    mechanism will reinforce the user’s knowledge (conveyed by the required signs
    and instructions) that the arms should be kept extended with the head and
    fingers pointing up.</p>

    altogether because, as that commentator said, “head first belly sliding is
    inherently dangerous under any circumstance and should not be allowed.” The
    Commission rejected this suggestion, reasoning that because there do exist safe
    belly sliding techniques and “head first belly sliding is a common way of using
    swimming pool slides,” prohibiting belly sliding would not be effective,
    especially in home pools. The Commission favoured recommending a minimum water depth
    of 4 feet for slide installation along with warning signs and instructions to
    be attached to the slide “to instruct the slide user in sliding techniques
    that, if followed, will reduce the unreasonable risk of injury associated with
    swimming pool slides.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commentators also suggested that the Commission
    instruct customers to restrict the installation of slides to pools sufficiently
    deep that injuries could not occur as a result of the user hitting the bottom
    of the pool. Some commentators noted studies on the risk of injury resulting
    from improper head first sliding in water depths of less than 5 feet. This
    suggestion was also rejected by the Commission because of the increased risk of
    drowning in deep water. The Commission instead recommended that defined transom
    signs be attached to all slides that displayed drawings of how a person can be
    injured going head first down a slide and flipping forward striking the bottom.
    That recommendation is based on this very significant statement by the
    Commission:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>The Commission believes that a person who
    purchases or uses a swimming pool slide should be given the information
    necessary to exercise an informed judgment on the merits of the product. A
    significant part of that information is a clear statement of the nature of the
    risks of injury associated with the use of the product. This is particularly
    important when the nature of the injury is as serious as paralysis or drowning.</i> Figures U and V in [the standard] apprise the potential user or purchaser of
    risks and consequences known to occur, and it is the Commission’s view that the
    explicit nature of the transom signs is necessary and desirable to eliminate or
    reduce the unreasonable risk of injury associated with swimming pool slides.

    considerations and reasons for recommending the final standard with a summary
    of its findings. The first finding addresses the standard’s importance:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Commission finds that unreasonable risks of death
    and injury from accidents are associated with swimming pool slides. These risks
    are (i) quadriplegia and paraplegia resulting from users (primarily adults
    using the swimming pool slide for the first time) sliding down the slide in a
    head first position and striking the bottom of the pool, (ii) leg fractures
    resulting from feet first entry, (iii) impact of sliders with other people in
    the pool, and (iv) falls from the slide ladder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These excerpts from the Commission’s standard and its explanation
    demonstrate that the accepted standard for pool slides involved more than
    simply a consideration of minimum pool depths. The standard included many other
    safety requirements, the most important of which is the mandatory provision of
    information and instructions concerning the extreme and non-obvious danger of
    paralysis if a slide is used improperly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The excerpts also show that the danger of pool slides
    is not something that is generally known based on “common sense.” In fact, the
    standard recognizes that head-first belly slides are a common and popular use
    of a slide. Consumers will not know, however, that by entering the water head
    first from a pool slide, there is an unexpected and uncontrollable flipping by
    the body that causes the head to hit the bottom of the pool if the water is
    shallow. Consumers also will not know that this can and does cause paraplegia
    and quadriplegia, catastrophic injuries that they would not expect or
    anticipate from using a simple and commonly available recreational device.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, the danger from using a pool slide in
    relatively shallow water is not an obvious danger. Consumers do not know that 4
    feet is the minimum depth for installing a pool slide that is usable by persons
    older than 13 years of age and that at such a depth, if one does not go down
    feet first, a significant risk of catastrophic injury arises. They do not know
    at what depth it becomes safe to go down head first so that the slider will not
    hit the bottom of the pool. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    . Based on the CPSS standard
    that the trial judge found was the applicable standard of care, the duty to
    warn of non-obvious dangers was similarly engaged when Pioneer Pools’ employees
    responded to Mrs. Walford’s specific inquiries for advice concerning pool
    safety. As Mrs. Walford reasonably viewed Pioneer Pools’ employees as pool
    experts whom she trusted and who were prepared to provide her with advice about
    her slide, they were obliged to provide a non-negligent answer in accordance
    with the duty to warn. That their motive, as found by the trial judge, was only
    to sell pool parts and not to mislead, does not absolve them from this duty of
    care. They were obliged to tell Mrs. Walford that although a slide could be
    used with a 4-foot pool, this was the minimum permissible depth for sliders
    above 13 years of age, and that if sliders did not go down feet first, they
    risked catastrophic injury. These are not mere “safety tips.” Nor do they
    convey warnings about dangers that would be obvious to the average consumer,
    such as those arising from jumping off the top of the slide or descending the
    slide in a standing position. As the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission
    recognized after making extensive findings, a customer who installs a slide in
    a shallow pool creates a risk of catastrophic injury from incorrect sliding
    technique, which would be entirely absent if the customer installed the same
    slide in a deeper pool. The nature and extent of this risk constitutes a hidden
    danger that engages the obligation to warn.</p>

    Court clarified that the basic test for determining causation remains the “but
    for” test. Mrs. Walford’s uncontroverted and unchallenged evidence was that had
    she been warned by Pioneer Pools about the danger of using a slide with a 4-foot
    pool, (i.e. “but for” the failure to warn) she would not have erected the
    slide, even after buying it. My colleague Rouleau J.A. suggests that the trial
    judge implicitly rejected this evidence even though the trial judge did not say
    so, and that he must have rejected it because he found the sole cause of the
    accident was Coreena’s failure to listen to her mother when she did not go down
    feet first. To the contrary, the reliability of that evidence was supported by
    the trial judge’s finding that Mrs. Walford was extremely safety conscious and
    cautious about her children’s use of the pool, and by her many efforts to
    satisfy herself from knowledgeable people that it would be “okay” to install a
    slide with a 4-foot pool. With respect to the legal conclusion regarding
    causation, it appears that the trial judge’s finding on causation was made
    without considering or applying the “but for” test.</p>

    for” test: but for the failure of the respondent’s employees to respond to Mrs.
    Walford’s inquires by warning her of the risks of installing the pool slide on
    her 4-foot pool, she would not have erected the slide and Correena would never have
    been injured going down it. The breach of duty and negligence of the respondent
    therefore caused or contributed to Correena’s injury.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Contributory Negligence</span></i></h4>

    contributory negligence arises on the appeal. The trial judge found that
    Correena’s failure to heed her mother’s admonition to only go down the slide
    “on her bum” was the sole cause of the accident. Because I have concluded that
    the negligence of the respondent caused or contributed to the accident based on
    the “but for” test, I must now consider whether Correena’s conduct makes her to
    some degree legally responsible for the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although Mrs. Walford gave her children many
    instructions and rules about using the pool, including to only slide down “on
    their bums” or “feet first”, she did not tell them why that was important or
    the extent of the danger if they were to deviate from that position. Mrs.
    Walford did not tell them because she had not been warned herself and was
    consequently unaware of the nature or degree of risk she had created by
    installing a slide on her shallow pool. Nor could Correena have reasonably
    known that her behaviour was as reckless as it turned out to be, as she was
    accustomed to using slides installed on deeper pools that did not require her
    to slide down feet first to ensure safety. As the U.S. Consumer Products Safety
    Commission found, using a pool slide in a position other than feet first is not
    necessarily a dangerous practice in deep pools and head first slides are a
    commonly accepted means of using swimming pool slides. The risk of catastrophic
    injury and paralysis only arises in the context of slides installed in pools
    whose water depth is close to or at the CPSS’ minimum depth standards.
    Furthermore, the cause of this risk is not immediately apparent to untutored
    users: it occurs principally because a slider’s body flips forward
    uncontrollably when it enters the water, even if the slider enters the water in
    a straight line. Considering that Correena was unable to appreciate the nature
    or extent of the danger due to the absence of an authoritative warning, she
    clearly did not assume the risk of catastrophic injuries when she went down the
    slide crouched down over her knees.</p>

line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Correena does bear some responsibility for
    failing to heed her mother’s safety rules. Although neither Correena nor her
    mother could have been reasonably expected to know why sliding only feet-first
    was a crucial safety rule in their shallow pool—indeed, it would have been
    largely irrelevant if the pool had been significantly deeper—Mrs. Walford
    appears to have correctly intuited that sliding feet-first would have ensured
    her children’s safety. Correena’s knowing decision to ignore her mother’s
    admonitions indicates a degree of carelessness on her part. In my view, her
    contribution to her loss can reasonably be fixed at 20 percent.</p>

    respondent and asked the question in contemplation of purchasing a slide.  On the latter two occasions, the context
    within which the questions were asked was a consumer presenting herself at a store
    after having already purchased a used slide.  The apparent reason for her visit to the store was to purchase a few
    small parts needed for the installation and repair of the slide.  The questions made no reference to
    safety.  Mrs. Walford did not ask whether
    installing such a slide with a 4-foot pool was safe nor did she ask how such a
    slide could safely be used in this 4-foot pool.  The very broad questions posed by Mrs. Walford could reasonably be
    understood as inquiring whether there are prohibitions or practical
    difficulties associated with the installation of this model of slide with a
    4-foot pool.  Assuming that the employees
    were familiar with the CPSS standard, the relevant standard applicable to the
    slide, the correct response was that slides of this type were permitted and

    stating that the answers given were truthful and not misleading, the trial
    judge went on to consider a hypothetical situation.  As the trial judge put it, “<u>even if</u>”

    accordance with the manufacturer’s safety instructions.  In the trial judge’s view, based on the CPSS
    standard, the answers given to this hypothetical interpretation of the
    questions would also be correct, as the CPSS standard does not find that
    installation of such a slide in a 4-foot pool is unsafe.  While one may or may not agree with this part
    of the trial judge’s reasons, because I have concluded that the trial judge’s
    primary finding – that the questions were not an inquiry as to whether it was
    safe to use the slide with a 4-foot pool or an inquiry about warnings or safety
    precautions – was supported by the evidence, I need not resolve this issue in
    order to dispose of the appeal.</p>

text-align:left;'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The level of expertise of the respondent’s employees</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is trite law that experts are held to a higher
    standard of care than the ordinary person.  In her reasons, Feldman J.A. concluded that the respondent’s expertise
    and knowledge were such that its duty to warn included a duty to advise of the
    risk of serious injury if misused and to give instructions as to how it should
    be used so as to reduce the risks.  The
    duty she would impose on the respondent is similar to the duty imposed on the
    slide’s manufacturer, Jacuzzi Canada Ltd.  In my colleague’s view, the “duty to warn of non-obvious dangers was
    similarly engaged when [the respondent’s] employees responded to Mrs. Walford’s
    specific inquiries for advice concerning pool safety”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I disagree.  First, as set out earlier, I do not interpret
    the questions posed by Mrs. Walford in the way Feldman J.A. has set out in her
    reasons.  They were not a “specific
    inquiry for advice concerning pool safety” nor was Mrs. Walford seeking “advice
    from [the respondent’s] employees of the hidden danger of catastrophic injury
    from erecting a slide on a 4-foot-deep aboveground pool.”  Mrs. Walford simply asked if it was “okay” to
    use it.  The trial judge rejected the
    suggestion that it would reasonably be understood to be an inquiry as to
    whether the slide could safely be used with a 4-foot pool or an inquiry about
    the safe usage of a slide in a 4-foot pool.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, quite apart from the interpretation to be given
    to the questions posed by Mrs. Walford, the trial judge had to determine
    whether the respondent’s employees’ answers were negligently given.  Relevant to this issue are the expertise of
    the respondent’s employees and the nature of the relationship.  The trial judge noted that the respondent’s
    employees were “not instructed to inquire as to the type of pool, should a
    customer come to the store for parts for a pool slide”.  They would have had no training in that
    regard.  The trial judge did not conclude
    that the respondent’s employees held themselves out to be experts with respect
    to slides.  He concluded that the
    evidence did not establish that the respondent “either knew or ought to have
    known that selling mountings to [Mrs.] Walford would permit her to install a
    slide that was unsafe in the circumstances”.  As the respondent’s employees possessed neither special skill nor
    knowledge on the facts of this case, the reasonable pool store employee would
    not be expected to know that selling the parts to Mrs. Walford would lead to
    the installation of a slide that would be improperly used.  This is a factual inference that the trial
    judge was entitled to draw from the evidence before him.  It follows, therefore, that the employee
    should not be held to an obligation to warn and the answers given were not
    negligent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was aware that a different and higher
    standard of care applies to manufacturers, since manufacturers have detailed
    knowledge of products gained through its own testing and can appreciate the
    risks and dangers not known to ordinary consumers.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    of products may, depending on what a distributor knew or ought to have known
    about the product, be the same or lower than that expected of manufacturers.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  It follows that the standard for a
    vendor of replacement parts will usually be lower still, since the vendor of
    replacement parts would not normally be expected to have the knowledge
    available to manufacturers or distributors or to advise customers respecting
    the proper use of the product. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial judge, “[t]he standard for
    manufacturers to meet when devising programmes to alert owners about product
    defects or dangers is thus very high”. Jacuzzi was held to this high standard
    which included a continuing duty to warn of the non-obvious dangers of serious
    injury from improper use of the slide.  The respondent, however, was not a
    manufacturer nor even a distributor of the slide.  The trial judge noted that the respondent
    “merely supplied missing parts for the slide”, that the respondent’s employees
    had no training with respect to use of slides and that the employees neither
    knew nor ought to have known that selling the mountings or fittings would
    result in the creation of non-obvious dangers.  The respondent was in a very different role
    and position as compared to Jacuzzi.  Based on his findings of fact, the trial judge applied a different and
    lower standard to the respondent.  He
    rejected the suggestion that the respondent had to tell Mrs. Walford more than
    simply advising her that the slide could be used in a 4-foot pool.  In my view, the trial judge was correct in applying
    a lower standard of care to the respondent and in concluding that the standard
    of care was met on the facts of this case. </p>

    the trial judge did not address the issue of causation in the context of the
    claim against the respondent, he did deal with causation when he considered the
    claim made against the manufacturer, Jacuzzi.  He found that Jacuzzi had fallen below the standard of care by not
    taking steps to ensure that appropriate warnings were fixed to the slide.  A manufacturer has the duty to ensure that
    its warning labels are according to CPSS standards and Jacuzzi had failed “to
    give adequate warning to users of the slide of the extreme danger of serious
    injury from improper use of the slide.”  Having made this determination, he nonetheless found that even if the
    duty of care had been met and the warnings provided, the accident and injury
    would have occurred.  The basis of his
    finding was that Mrs. Walford had given the appropriate warnings to her
    daughter and it was her daughter’s failure to heed the warnings that caused the
    accident.</span></p>

    J.A. would set aside this finding by the trial judge.  She does so by accepting that Mrs. Walford’s
    “uncontroverted and unchallenged evidence was that had she been warned by
    Pioneer Pools about the danger of using a slide with a 4-foot pool … she would
    not have erected the slide, even after buying it.”  Applying the “but for test”, Feldman J.A.
    concluded that the injury would not have occurred if the respondent’s employees
    had warned Mrs. Walford of the dangers if misused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Walford’s evidence on this point needs to be put into context.  At trial, Mrs. Walford’s position and the
    evidence of her expert was that the slide was defective and unsafe.  She maintained that it did not meet CPSS
    standards and should never have been installed.  It is in this context that the trial judge would have considered Mrs.
    Walford’s testimony on this point.  In
    the face of Mrs. Walford’s evidence and even recognizing Mrs. Walford’s safety-conscious
    nature, the trial judge concluded that even if Jacuzzi had warned of the
    extreme danger of serious injury from improper use of the slide, the accident
    would have occurred.  Although the trial
    judge did not specifically reject Mrs. Walford’s assertion that she would not
    have installed the slide had she been warned of the risks, its rejection is
    implicit in the conclusion he reached.  It is also reasonable when weighed in light of the evidence that risk of
    injury or death if misused exists for all slides, whether installed in a 4-foot
    or deeper pool, as well as the evidence of Mrs. Walford’s knowledge of the
    risks.  The trial judge’s conclusion that
    even if the warnings had been given the accident would have occurred is
    therefore supported by the facts of this case.  This finding on causation applies to the claim against the respondent as
    well as the claim against Jacuzzi.</span></p>

    standards.  More importantly, the trial
    judge was aware that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission charged with
    developing the CPSS standard found that “unreasonable risks of death or injury
    from accidents are associated with swimming pool slides”.  Any slide purchased would come with a warning
    of serious risks if misused.  Although
    the level and nature of risk varies according to the type of slide and depth of
    the pool, use of slides in any pool carries serious risks that requires
    warnings and obedience to warnings. </span></p>

    J.A., Mrs. Walford may not have been aware of the precise mechanism whereby
    injury could occur if someone were to go down head first or were to belly
    slide, Mrs. Walford was clearly aware that it was dangerous for a person to go
    down the slide other than in the seated position.  Mrs. Walford agreed that it “was obviously
    dangerous and foolhardy” to go down the slide head first and that it is “just
    plain common sense to go down on your bum and enter the water feet first”.  As she testified, this was “my common
    sense”.  Mrs. Walford therefore
    instructed her children accordingly.  They were to go down feet first and not go into the pool head first.</span></p>

    Mrs. Walford’s questions and the level of expertise expected of the
    respondent’s employees in the circumstances of this case. Both of these
    findings were factual inferences based on evidence before the trial judge, and
    there is no basis to set them aside.  <span
style='color:black'>Even if they are not considered to be stand alone findings
    of fact and are taken to be a part of the overall determination of whether the
    standard of care was met, the trial judge’s finding of negligence is a question
    of mixed fact and law which is entitled to a high degree of deference.  The trial judge did not apply an incorrect
    legal test and he considered all of the evidence.  As set out in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 29-30, “a
    finding of negligence by the trial judge should be deferred to by appellate
    courts” because “requiring a standard of ‘palpable and overriding error’ for
    findings of negligence made by either a trial judge or a jury reinforces the proper
