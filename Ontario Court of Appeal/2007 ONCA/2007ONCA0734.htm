    committal for extradition to the Republic of Hungary on three bases: that a
    stay of the proceeding ought to have been granted on the basis that it was an
    abuse of process, that the evidence was not sufficient to meet the test for
    committal, and that various comments made by the extradition judge gave rise to
    a reasonable apprehension of bias.  In
    oral submissions, counsel focussed on the bias ground and did not pursue the insufficiency
    of evidence ground.</p>

    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Republic of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Hungary.  The grounds advanced are, first, that the
    Minister had no jurisdiction to surrender Horvath because a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment
    program (PRRA) officer had concluded that Horvath faced “more than a mere
    possibility of persecution” if returned to Hungary and declared Horvath to be a
    “protected person” under the <i>Immigration</i> <i>and</i> <i>Refugee</i> <i>Protection</i> Act S.C.
    2001, c. 21 (IRPA).  Second, the Minister
    of Justice had no authority to consult with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
    and, in deciding to do so, the Minister of Justice erred.  Further, the information received from the
    Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and relied on by the Minister of
    Justice was incorrect and undermined the conclusions reached by the PRRA officer
    as to the risk of returning Horvath to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Hungary</st1:country-region>
    .  Third, the Minister of Justice committed a
    jurisdictional error by surrendering Horvath for offences outside the terms of
    the treaty with
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>

    in 1999 as a consequence of numerous abuses inflicted upon them.  Many of these abuses were perpetrated by the

    but, on October 4, 2004, he was granted the status of “protected person”
    pursuant to the PRRA process set out in the IRPA.  The “protected person” designation was made
    by a PRRA officer on behalf of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  The designation was made because the officer
    was satisfied that Horvath, because of his Roma ethnicity, would face “more
    than a mere possibility of persecution” if returned to

    and of the extradition proceeding is to persecute him because he is Roma.  As a result, the extradition proceeding
    should be found to constitute an abuse of process.  In this court, Horvath submits that the
    extradition judge erred in refusing the stay and that the conduct of the
    extradition judge during the proceeding gave rise to a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.  We disagree.</p>

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>

    of limited relevance, did not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias.  Several of the questions were asked
    in response to the abuse of process claim being advanced by Horvath.  Horvath alleged that he was being targeted
    for persecution by the requesting state and, through his questions, the
    extradition judge was seeking to understand how Horvath could be the subject of
    persecution in Hungary given that his name and physical appearance did not
    readily identify him as a Roma.  While I
    acknowledge that the questions could have been framed in a more sensitive
    fashion and the questioning may not have been necessary, there is no reason to
    question the extradition judge’s <i>bona
    fides</i> in seeking to better understand this issue.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 17, 2006, the then Minister of Justice Toews
    ordered Horvath’s surrender to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    .  Subsequently, Horvath asked that the
    surrender order be reconsidered and, on May 4, 2007, the then Minister of
    Justice Nicholson advised that he was satisfied the surrender order should be
    maintained.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    be extradited, he argues that the Minister of Justice committed reviewable
    errors in reaching his surrender decision.  Specifically, Horvath submits that Minister Toews erred in consulting
    the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  Further, Horvath argues that both Ministers of Justice erred in
    considering the information provided by the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration because that information sought to and did undermine the finding
    previously made by the PRRA officer on behalf of the Minister of Citizenship
    and Immigration.  As set out previously,
    the PRRA officer found that Horvath faced “more than a mere possibility of
    persecution” if returned to

    that prior to making an order surrendering a person who has made a claim for
    refugee protection, the Minister of Justice “shall” consult with the Minister
    of Citizenship and Immigration.  Horvath
    submitted that this provision exists so that, where the person sought has claimed
    refugee status, the Minister of Justice will receive an assessment of risk from
    the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration before making a decision on
    surrender.  In the present case, because
    Horvath was not seeking refugee status and the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration’s risk assessment had already been provided through the PRRA officer’s
    report, the Minister of Justice had no jurisdiction to seek what would, in
    effect, be a second risk assessment by the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration.</p>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with this interpretation of the provision.  Section 40(2) of the <i>Extradition</i> <i>Act</i> does not
    purport to limit the circumstances in which the Minister of Justice can consult
    with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (nor, for that matter, other
    ministers); it only requires the Minister to do so in the context of an
    undecided refugee claim.  In fact, in his
    submissions to Minister Toews, Horvath took the position that, in the
    circumstances of his case, Minister Toews was required to consult the Minister
    of Citizenship and Immigration.  </p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    .  Horvath argues that the Federal Court of
    Appeal in <i>Adjei v.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>,
    [1989] 2 F.C. 680 and in <i>Ponniah v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i> (1991), 132 N.R. 32 has, in
    effect, equated the expressions “more than a mere possibility” and “a serious
    possibility”.  As a result, the Minister
    of Citizenship and Immigration’s statement that he was not persuaded of “a
    serious possibility” directly contradicts the PRRA officer’s finding that
    Horvath faced “more than a mere possibility” of persecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Horvath points to portions of the Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration’s case summary, which suggests that, somehow, the
    situation in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    has changed and that Romas now benefit from state protection.  These statements, Horvath argues, are wrong
    or misleading.  The Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration does not set out what had changed in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    since
    the determination made by the PRRA officer.  Further, the Minister has not applied the appropriate legal standards
    with respect to the assessment of state protection.  The fact that there have been improvements
    and serious efforts is not sufficient.  The test in matters involving refugee claims is whether the state
    protection is effective and adequate (see <i>Molnar
    v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2003] 2 F.C. 339 (T.D.)).  Horvath submits, therefore, that in reaching
    his decision, the Minister of Justice relied on information that was wrong and
    misleading.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to these submissions.  The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
    and both Minister Toews and Minister Nicholson were aware of the PRRA officer’s
    conclusion that Horvath faced “more than a mere possibility of persecution” if
    returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Hungary</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statement contained in the Minister of Citizenship
    and Immigration’s case summary to the effect that he was not persuaded of “a
    serious possibility” that Horvath would be subjected to persecution if returned
    to Hungary could, if read in conjunction with the cases cited by Horvath,
    suggest that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration disagreed with or
    sought to reverse the PRRA officer’s decision.  Although the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration’s choice of words was
    clearly unfortunate, when that statement is considered in the context of what
    the Minister was asked to do and the whole of the case summary he provided, I
    am of the view that it was not intended to contradict nor would it have been
    understood to be contradicting the PRRA officer’s findings.  I say this for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Minister of Justice’s decision clearly
    acknowledged that Horvath was a “protected person” and there is no suggestion in
    the decisions of Minister Toews and Minister Nicholson that they interpreted
    the case summary from the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as overruling
    or contradicting the PRRA officer’s finding.  Minister Nicholson’s decision states as follows: “Minister Toews clearly
    accepted that Mr. Horvath had ‘protected person’ status in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and he
    actively considered the findings of the PRRA officer as being relevant factors
    in his assessment.”  Minister Nicholson went
    on to state: “[a]s a result, it is also clear to me that Mr Horvath’s ‘protected
    person’ status was not in dispute insofar as the findings made in the [Minister
    of Citizenship and Immigration’s] Case Summary were concerned.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the framework within which the PRRA officer
    assesses risk is different from the framework within which that of the Minister
    of Justice must assess risk.  As noted in
    Minister Nicholson’s decision: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The decision of the PRRA officer was made in the context of the
    immigration process, not the extradition process, and it is evident that in
    concluding that Mr. Horvath would not benefit from the protections generally available
    to persons in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Hungary</st1:country-region>
    ,
    the PRRA focused largely on his specific claims of ill treatment.  The assessment did not take into account
    Canada’s obligation to its foreign treaty partner to surrender a person sought
    on criminal charges, subject, of course, to such surrender being in conformity
    with the principles of fundamental justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the extradition process, the risk being assessed is
    different than the risk assessed in the immigration process.  In my view, therefore, the Minister of
    Justice could quite properly seek input from the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration.  This input would be for a
    purpose different from the assessment made by the PRRA officer.  As set out by Minister Nicholson, concerns in
    the extradition process include “the general availability of protections in the
    state seeking a person’s extradition, particularly as regards the safeguards in
    their judicial and correctional systems”.  This information “is entirely relevant to the
    Justice Minister’s executive role in determining whether surrender would be
    fair.  Such information is vital to the
    proper balancing of the competing interests of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s treaty partner with the
    individual interests of the person sought for extradition.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minister Toews and Minister Nicholson understood their
    role and did not misinterpret the information provided by the Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration.  Specifically,
    Minister Toews acknowledged that police mistreatment still exists in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    .  He nonetheless relied on the assessment of
    the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration that “there are no substantial
    grounds to believe that [Mr. Horvath] will be tortured and it is unlikely that
    his life will be at risk or that he will be subjected to face cruel and unusual
    treatment or punishment, should he be returned to the Republic of Hungary
    today.”  In my view, the Minister
    properly took this into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the test to be applied by the Minister of
    Justice when assessing risk is different than the test applied by a PRRA
    officer.  The PRRA officer assesses
    whether there existed “more than a mere possibility of persecution”.  This does not involve being satisfied on a
    balance of probability standard.  By
    contrast, the test applied by the Minister of Justice is an assessment on a
    balance of probability standard.  Minister Toews acknowledged this different standard of proof when he
    referred to this court’s decision in <i>United
    States of Mexico v. Hurley</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 414 (Ont. C.A.).  This decision stands for the proposition that
    the person sought must establish that he will in fact be subjected to the
    persecution he alleges and that this must be established on the higher standard
    of a balance of probability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, therefore, the Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration’s case summary was not intended to overrule or undermine the PRRA
    officer’s decision.  Nor did it attempt
    to show that, since the PRRA officer’s assessment, the situation in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Hungary</st1:country-region>
    had changed
    such that, if a new PRRA were carried out in accordance with the standard of proof
    applicable to such assessments, the PRRA officer would conclude that Romas now
    benefited from improved police and state protection.  Rather, the case summary was a risk
    assessment that acknowledged the PRRA officer’s conclusions and provided
    additional information relevant to the surrender decision that the Minister of
    Justice was called upon to make.  This
    difference was understood by the Minister of Justice.</p>

    <i> (

    )
    at para. 55, “it is the appellant’s conduct that must be considered when
    determining whether the offence with which he is charged is included in the
    offences listed in the treaty.”  Crimes
    listed in treaties are intended to catch broad categories of conduct.</p>
