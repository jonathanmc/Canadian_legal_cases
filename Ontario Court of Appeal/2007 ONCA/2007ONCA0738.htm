line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal of a ruling made by Del Frate J. on a
    pre-trial motion seeking the return of a tractor-trailer the police had taken
    to a towing compound after it collided with a train on April 26, 2003.  The appellant was the lessee of the
    unit.  He was charged with criminal
    negligence and dangerous driving because of its allegedly unroadworthy condition,
    though he was not the driver involved in the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tractor-trailer remained at the towing company’s
    compound from April 26, 2003 until the end of July 2005 when the police and/or Crown
    released it from control.  Subsequently,
    it seems the towing company disposed of the vehicle to recover the cost of
    storing it.  Despite the fact the police
    and Crown no longer controlled the vehicle and its whereabouts were unknown,
    the appellant brought a pre-trial motion before the judge presiding at his
    criminal trial headed Motion for an Order Returning Things Seized under s.  490 of the Criminal Code.  A copy of that motion was not included in the
    appeal book, but it is apparent the appellant sought an order that the Crown
    return the tractor-trailer unit to him.  In his notice of appeal, he claims “an order allowing appeal and just
    restitution of value of the truck trailer in the amount of $42,000”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the seizure and detention of
    the tractor-trailer was never authorized by any judicial authority.  He points out that the procedures respecting
    the seizure and detention of property set out in ss.  489, 489.1, and 490 of the Criminal Code were
    not followed.  He submits that the police
    are responsible for paying any costs of storing property they have detained for
    the purposes of their investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown resists responsibility for the storage costs
    and for the vehicle.  The Crown’s
    position is that after it completed its inspection of the vehicle, the vehicle
    continued to be stored at the towing compound to permit the appellant a full
    opportunity to inspect it.  Before the
    trial judge the Crown did not identify the source of its authority to seize and
    detain the vehicle.  In this court, the Crown
    claimed for the first time that the tractor-trailer could have been detained
    under s. 217(4) of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>, thus entitling it to rely on s.  217(5) of that Act, which provides that “all costs and charges for the
    care and storage of a motor vehicle detained under subsection (4) are a lien
    upon the motor vehicle, which may be enforced in the manner provided by the <i>Repair and Storage Liens Act</i>”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unnecessary to unravel these issues in order to
    determine that the appeal must be dismissed.  As the record before the trial judge established that the towing company
    had disposed of the vehicle, he properly found that he could not order the Crown
    to return it.  The appellant’s claim is,
    as stated in his Notice of Appeal, for “just restitution of the value of the
    truck-trailer”.  This is a civil claim
    over which the judge presiding at his criminal trial had no jurisdiction.  The judge noted that the appellant did not
    seek any of the remedies that were within his authority:  there was no prejudice to the fairness of the
    appellant’s trial and the appellant did not seek the exclusion of any evidence
    obtained from the Crown’s inspection of the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submitted that this court’s decision in <i>The Queen v. Khuan Mihn Mac</i> (1995), 97
    C.C.C. (3d) 115 assisted him.  However,
    in that case the property seized, money, remained in the hands of the Crown.  The court found that the Crown had no
    authority to retain the property if it had no authority to seize it, and so it
    should be returned.  Here, the property
    seized, whether properly or not, is no longer in the hands of the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In dismissing the appellant’s motion for return of the
    tractor-trailer, the judge stated he could not address the issues of civil
    liability and noted that they could be the subject of further litigation.  Rather than commencing a civil suit the
    appellant pursued this appeal.   The
    trial judge’s observations were correct.   The appeal is dismissed.</p>
