  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue on this appeal and application for
    judicial review is whether the conduct of Canadian and French authorities in
    extradition proceedings amounted to an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2002, in his absence, Ben Cong Liang was
    convicted of five drug related offences in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    .  He was sentenced to ten years in jail.  In May 2003, Mr. Liang pleaded guilty to
    several drug related offences in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He was sentenced to five years
    imprisonment.  In February 2004, the
    <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">
    Republic of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    France
    asked
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to extradite Mr. Liang so that he could serve his ten year French sentence.  In early March 2004 – a day before he was to
    be released on day parole on his Canadian sentence – Mr. Liang was arrested in
    connection with the extradition proceedings against him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both before the extradition judge on the committal
    hearing and before the Minister of Justice on the surrender decision, Mr. Liang
    submitted that the extradition proceedings against him amounted to an abuse of
    process.  He contended that the French
    and Canadian authorities intentionally delayed bringing these proceedings and
    that this delay severely prejudiced him.  He asked either for a stay or for an order that he not be surrendered.  Both the extradition judge, Karam J., and the
    Minister rejected Mr. Liang’s submissions.  The extradition judge ordered his committal and the Minister ordered his
    surrender without conditions.  He asks to
    set aside both orders.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court Mr. Liang renews his abuse of process
    submission and argues that the extradition judge and the Minister erred in
    failing to give effect to it.  He also
    argues that the Minister erred in failing to hold that his surrender would
    violate his right to remain in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Finally, he argues that the Minister erred in
    failing to give proper consideration to his offer to plead guilty in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to the conduct that was the subject of
    the charges in

    authorities charged Mr. Liang with five drug related offences: complicity in
    unlawfully importing a narcotic (trafficking); complicity in unlawfully
    transporting a narcotic; complicity in unlawfully possessing a narcotic;
    complicity in possessing goods deemed to have been unlawfully imported

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By February 2001, Canadian authorities had become aware
    of Mr. Liang’s involvement in drug trafficking.  They initiated a large scale investigation called “Project
    Ombrage”.  This investigation led them to
    characterize Mr. Liang as “a mastermind behind this form of drug importation”
    and “the head of a network of organized criminals responsible for maintaining
    and operating many hydroponic marijuana grow cultivations throughout the
    greater
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    with fifty-eight drug related offences.  In May 2003 he pleaded guilty to three of these charges: the importation
    of ecstasy between March 1, 2001 and December 14, 2001; conspiracy to produce
    marijuana between April 1, 2001 and January 17, 2002; and conspiracy to traffic
    in marijuana between April 1, 2001 and January 17, 2002.  He was sentenced to five years imprisonment,
    which was reduced to take account of ten months pre-trial custody.</p>

    Mr. Liang in

    captured
    any of his conduct in issue in

    ’s
    extradition request and the committal hearing.  The time frames differed: the French charges arose out of the August
    2000 seizure, which predated “Project Ombrage” by six months.  None of the Canadian charges concerned the importation
    of drugs into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    or the
    possession, transportation, or acquisition of drugs within
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>

    acknowledged that the material filed by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    in support of its
    extradition request met the two requirements for committal under s. 29(1)(a) of
    the <i>Extradition</i> <i>Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18.  There
    was admissible evidence of conduct that had it occurred in Canada would have
    justified committal for trial in Canada on charges of importation, trafficking,
    and possession for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the <i>Controlled</i> <i>Drugs</i> <i>and</i> <i>Substances</i> <i>Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19; and Mr. Liang was the person sought by

    the appeal from the committal order was whether the failure to bring
    extradition proceedings before February 2004 amounted to an abuse of process
    warranting a stay of proceedings.  Mr.
    Liang submits that the extradition judge’s refusal to grant a stay was
    unreasonable.  In the alternative, he
    submits that even if the extradition judge’s refusal was supportable on the
    material filed at the committal hearing, he now has an additional and important
    piece of evidence that strongly supports a stay.  </p>

    French and Canadian authorities delayed the extradition process for an
    unacceptably long time.  This lengthy
    delay, Mr. Liang argues, prejudiced him in two ways: he spent more time in
    custody awaiting extradition than he should have, and more significantly, he
    was prevented from resolving all the charges against him – French and Canadian
    – in one jurisdiction at one time.  On
    this latter branch of his prejudice argument, Mr. Liang claims
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    intentionally refused to act on
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    December 2002 request that he be provisionally arrested.  Had he been arrested then, he could have made
    “his peace” and arranged his affairs.  He
    points out that Canadian courts have disapproved the practice of leaving arrest
    warrants outstanding and that this disapproval should apply equally to
    extradition proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The extradition judge found that the delay probably
    prejudiced Mr. Liang but found no evidence that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    or
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    was responsible for it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While it is
    apparent that the chronology of events demonstrates that any delay and lack of
    information probably has resulted in prejudice, at least to cause him, at some
    point, to spend time in pre-trial custody on the French charges, when he could
    have simultaneously been serving his Canadian sentence, or at worst exposing
    him to double jeopardy, there is an absence of evidence as to whether
    responsibility for either the delay, if there was a delay, or non-disclosure
    can be attributed to the authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, importantly for Mr. Liang’s submission, the
    extradition judge did observe that had there been evidence the authorities had
    manipulated the extradition process to cause delay and prejudice him, that may
    well have amounted to an abuse of process:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Certainly,
    either the manipulation of the extradition process to cause delay in order to
    maximize the applicant’s incarceration, or the manipulation of the judicial
    process to mislead him into negotiating a plea agreement in ignorance of the
    disposition of the French charges, would, if proven, constitute an abuse of
    process and could be said to disturb the community’s sense of fair play and
    decency. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the extradition judge found no such evidence, and
    therefore found no abuse of process.  He
    applied the proper test for a stay, dismissed Mr. Liang’s application, and
    ordered his committal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, since
    the onus rests with the applicant and since there is no evidence before the
    Court, either of a course of conduct on the part of authorities to delay the
    process, or even that the length of time in question constituted an undue
    delay, there is no basis upon which to conclude that there was an abuse of
    process in that respect.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Similarly, there
    is no evidence that the applicant was misled when negotiating with Canadian
    authorities, or even that he was unaware of the disposition of the French
    allegations at the time.  While it seems
    highly problematic, that he would not have been informed by notice in writing
    of his conviction and sentence, I certainly cannot conclude that such a failure
    by itself constitutes an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>After careful
    consideration of the circumstances in this case, in the absence of evidence
    supporting the allegations of abuse of process, I am unable to find a violation
    of the fundamental principles of justice that underlie the community’s sense of
    fair play and decency.  It, therefore,
    does not meet the “clearest of cases” test, so as to justify a stay of these
    proceedings, and accordingly, this application is dismissed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In renewing his argument for a stay, Mr. Liang submits
    that material disclosed to him after the committal hearing provides the
    evidence of manipulation the extradition judge said was missing.  The evidence, Mr. Liang contends, is
    contained in a September 13, 2005 memorandum prepared for the Minister, which
    includes a diplomatic note from France dated December 20, 2002 supporting its
    request for Mr. Liang’s provisional arrest.  The memorandum shows two things: one, an ongoing dialogue between French
    and Canadian authorities well before the Canadian charges were dealt with, in
    which the RCMP asked for France’s assistance in its investigation into Mr.
    Liang’s activities; and two, Canada made a decision around December 20, 2002
    not to act on France’s request for a provisional arrest warrant.  Mr. Liang submits that this “fresh” evidence
    ought to be admitted on the appeal of his committal order and that it would
    have affected the extradition judge’s decision to commit. </p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well established that the doctrine of abuse of
    process applies to extradition proceedings to protect the integrity and
    fairness of those proceedings.  See <i>R. v. Cobb</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 270
    (S.C.C.); and <i>R. v. Larosa</i> (2002),
    166 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The question on this appeal is whether the
    extradition judge erred in concluding that the integrity and fairness of Mr.
    Liang’s extradition proceeding was not compromised.  In my view, he did not.  And the new evidence proffered on the appeal would
    not change the result of the committal hearing.  I say this for a number of reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the record is silent why
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    did not act on the request for a
    provisional arrest in December 2002, and therefore to suggest that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    did so for an improper purpose is mere speculation.  Indeed, it is quite plausible that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    did not act because at the time Mr. Liang was detained in custody.  Thus, a warrant for his provisional arrest,
    which under s. 13(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition</i> <i>Act</i> is generally issued to prevent a
    person from escaping or committing an offence, was unnecessary.  In short, there is no evidence of
    manipulation or any other state misconduct in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s failure to act on the
    provisional arrest request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, I see nothing objectionable in the RCMP’s
    request for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    assistance in its investigation.  Moreover, the request occurred well before Mr. Liang was convicted in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ,
    and therefore did not cause any delay in his extradition proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and perhaps most important, Mr. Liang’s
    submission on abuse of process is based on the indefensible proposition that he
    had the right to plead guilty in Canada to all charges arising out of his
    international drug trafficking.  He has
    no such right.  I agree with the Attorney
    General’s argument that criminals such as Mr. Liang whose crimes know no
    borders run the risk that any of the countries harmed by their actions may
    justifiably demand that they answer for their actions in that country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is particularly so in Mr. Liang’s case because
    even if he were to plead guilty in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to conspiracy to import drugs into
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , that plea would not capture
    the conduct that underlies the French convictions.  It would not capture Mr. Liang’s conviction
    for the importation of drugs into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    or his convictions for the transportation, possession, and acquisition of drugs
    within
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    .  Thus, any delay in the extradition
    proceedings did not affect his ability to resolve all of his charges at once in
    one jurisdiction.  He simply was not
    entitled to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the record contains no evidence that Mr. Liang
    was misled by Canadian or French authorities or that information concerning the
    convictions in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    was
    withheld from him when he negotiated his plea and sentence agreement in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  To the contrary, at his bail hearing in
    August 2002, Mr. Liang became aware that he was under investigation in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    .  Yet, he apparently made no inquiries about
    his legal jeopardy in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    before he pleaded guilty in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in May 2003.  His own lack of due
    diligence seriously undercuts his argument on prejudice and unfairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, although Canadian courts have rightly criticized
    the practice of holding warrants of arrest and not acting on them, this
    criticism is directed to domestic proceedings and not extradition
    proceedings.  See for example <i>R. v. Cardinal</i> (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d)
    254 (Alta.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );
    and <i>R. v. Parisien</i> (1971), 3 C.C.C.
    (2d) 433 (B.C.C.A.).  In domestic
    proceedings, an accused generally has the right under s. 478(3) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> to consolidate charges laid in different jurisdictions and
    have them dealt with in one province.  No
    similar right exists in extradition proceedings.  A person subject to several extradition
    requests cannot gather up these requests and insist on having them dealt with
    in one country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, it is much harder to obtain a remedy for delay
    in an extradition proceeding than for delay in a domestic prosecution because
    activities that cross national boundaries and involve different legal systems are
    inevitably complex.  As La Forest J. said
    writing for the majority of the court in <i>R.
    v.</i> <i>Mellino</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536
    at 554-5, “[I]t is not the business of an extradition judge to assume
    responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the
    evidence for an extradition hearing.… Nor is an extradition judge empowered to weigh
    the ultimate issue of whether delay will affect the trial of the action in a
    foreign country.”  Moreover, the delay in
    bringing extradition proceedings in <i>Mellino</i> was considerably longer than that in the present case.  Yet, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded
    that the delay in <i>Mellino</i> did not
    constitute an abuse of process or a contravention of the principles of
    fundamental justice.  If it did not do so
    in <i>Mellino</i>, it is difficult to see
    how it does in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seventh, and finally, any possible prejudice Mr. Liang
    may have suffered because of the delay in the extradition proceedings is
    significantly attenuated by two considerations:
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    is willing to grant him a new trial, and if he is convicted again, it is
    willing to credit against his sentence any time he spent in pre-extradition
    custody in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To obtain a stay, Mr. Liang must show an abuse of
    process – a serious compromise of the integrity and fairness of the extradition
    process – on the clearest of cases standard.  He has not done so.  His appeal
    against the committal order must fail.  </p>

    under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  And third, he says that the Minister
    committed a reviewable error in failing to properly consider his undertaking to

    :
    the Minister wrongly held that

    immaterial.  I do not agree that the

    whether it is a desirable option having regard to our country’s international
    obligations and a legitimate request from one of our extradition partners.  See

    that the Minister made in ordering surrender.  Mr. Liang contends that the Minister failed to meaningfully consider
    either these factors or Articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty.  I begin with the two Treaty provisions.  Both provisions address when extradition may
    be refused, and both are permissive.  Article
    5.1 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Extradition may
    be refused:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         if the person sought is being
    prosecuted by the requested State for the offence for which extradition is
    requested or if the competent authorities of the requested State have decided,
    in accordance with the procedure provided by the law of that State, not to
    prosecute or have decided to terminate the prosecution they have instituted.   </p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Article
    5.1 deals with cases where, for example,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    has asserted jurisdiction

    the jurisdiction that has the most comprehensive case; and, the jurisdiction

    mitigated any violation of Mr. Liang’s right to remain in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i>: he was entitled to return to

    if acquitted, or on completion of his sentence in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>

line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister’s exercise of discretion on the
    inappropriateness of a domestic prosecution “attracts a high degree of
    deference” from a reviewing court: see <i>Kwok</i> at 579.  Unless the Minister exercised
    that discretion unreasonably this court should not interfere.  In the light of the considerations referred
    to by the Minister, his decision that surrender would not violate Mr. Liang’s
    right under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter</i> was reasonable.  This court has no basis
    to interfere with it.</p>

    v. Ross </i>(1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 446.  In <i>Ross</i>, the Supreme Court, in
    upholding a surrender order, “substantially” agreed with the reasons of Taylor
    J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d)
    500.  At 536, Taylor J.A. suggested that
    the offer of a person subject to an extradition request to plead guilty in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    to
    charges relating to the conduct in question is a matter for the Minister to
    consider in deciding whether to order surrender.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, the Minister relied on <i>Ross</i> for the proposition that “a person
    sought for extradition cannot choose the jurisdiction in which he will be
    sentenced by offering to plead guilty”.  For that reason the Minister refused to give Mr. Liang’s undertaking any
    weight.  As counsel for Mr. Liang pointed
    out, that proposition likely comes from the concurring reasons of Finch J.A. in <i>Ross</i>, not from the reasons of Taylor
    J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, even if the Minister’s reliance on <i>Ross</i> was misplaced, it does not assist
    Mr. Liang.  At its highest, Mr. Liang’s
    undertaking is a factor for the Minister to consider.  It is not determinative of where he should be
    prosecuted.  Moreover, Mr. Liang’s purpose
    in undertaking to plead guilty in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is undoubtedly to obtain a less severe sentence than he received or likely
    would receive if convicted anew in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    .  That purpose – Taylor J.A. recognized in <i>Ross</i> – does not justify refusing
    extradition.  And, to repeat again what I
    said earlier, a charge in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    would not encompass the conduct that lies at the heart of the charges in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
