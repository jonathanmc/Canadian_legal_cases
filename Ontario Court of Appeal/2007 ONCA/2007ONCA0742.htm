    the essential character of the dispute between the parties is one of contract,
    bringing it within the court’s jurisdiction, or one involving police
    discipline, placing it within the jurisdiction of the Toronto Police Services
    Board, pursuant to the <i>Police</i> <i>Services</i> <i>Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15.  </p>

    contractual one and, accordingly, concluded that the matter was within the
    court’s jurisdiction.  With respect, we take
    a different view.  In our opinion, for
    the reasons that follow, the essential issue is one of police discipline that
    falls exclusively within the jurisdictional regime set out in the <i>Police Services Act</i>. </p>

    Police Jane Dick and Staff Superintendent Tony Corrie (the individual
    appellants) and the Toronto Police Services Board (the Board) appeal from the
    order of the motion judge in which she dismissed the appellants’ motions to
    dismiss, strike or stay the application against them and to set aside the registrar’s
    order amending the notice of application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, the Toronto Police Association (TPA),
    initiated the application against the individual appellants and the Board
    pursuant to Rule 14.05 of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure, </i>R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, seeking, amongst other relief, a
    declaration that there was a binding agreement between the TPA and the Board to
    resolve disciplinary charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged agreement resulted from a dispute that
    arose after certain police officers wore their police uniforms to a union rally
    in contravention of an explicit order of the Chief of Police. Following this
    conduct, certain of the individual appellants met with representatives of the
    TPA in an effort to resolve the disciplinary matters arising from the rally.
    The parties agreed to the forfeiture of three days pay. However, they are at
    odds about whether they also agreed that the penalty would not be used in
    relation to the officers’ future discipline proceedings and their future
    careers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, subsequent to the disagreement about the terms
    and finality of the alleged agreement, a letter was sent to each officer involved
    advising of the terms on which the Chief proposed to resolve the
    discipline.  His proposal set out the three-day
    penalty and the circumstances in which the penalty would be relevant to future
    personnel decisions.  The letter advised
    the officers that they could either accept the proposed resolution in lieu of a
    hearing, or, if they decided not to accept the resolution, the matter would be
    referred for hearing pursuant to the <i>Police
    Services Act. </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, the TPA’s solicitor advised the Chief’s
    solicitor that “each officer will decide” whether to accept the discipline or
    challenge any charges at a hearing.  Subsequently,
    each officer signed an acceptance of the proposed resolution subject to an
    “Addendum” that the officers reserved their rights with respect to the
    enforceability of the alleged agreement between the TPA and the Board.  None of the officers requested a hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Rather than
    pursuing relief under the <i>Police Services
    Act</i>, the Toronto Police Association brought these proceedings. The
    appellants responded to the application with motions brought pursuant to Rules
    14, 21.01 and 25.11 to dismiss, strike or stay the application on grounds,
    amongst others, that the court was without jurisdiction to determine the
    matters in issue because they were governed by the <i>Police Services Act. </i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days prior to the return of the appellants’ motions,
    the TPA obtained an order from the registrar amending its application to add
    several claims in tort.  In response, the
    appellants brought further motions to strike the amendments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In dismissing the appellants’ motions, the motion judge
    concluded that the existence, interpretation and enforceability of the terms of
    this agreement changed the essential nature of the dispute between the parties
    from one about police discipline to one of contract.</p>

    Association Inc. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Regina
    (City) Board of Police Commissioners,</i> [2000] 1 S.C.R. 360, which dealt with
    whether a dispute was properly the subject of a collective agreement, gives
    guidance on the proper approach to the characterization of the dispute.  At paragraph 39, Justice Bastarache stated: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [T]he
    key question in each case is whether the essential character of a dispute, in
    its factual context, arises either expressly or inferentially from a statutory
    scheme.  In determining this question, a
    liberal interpretation of the legislation is required to ensure that a scheme
    is not offended by the conferral of jurisdiction on a forum not intended by the
    legislature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the court said in <i>Regina Police Association</i>, the characterization of the dispute is
    resolved by whether “the subject matter of the dispute expressly or
    inferentially is governed by the [statute].”<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory scheme at issue in this case is the <i>Police Services Act</i>.  Part V of that <i>Act</i> sets out a complete code with respect to police
    discipline.  That code includes
    investigation of the complaint, a hearing of the complaint, a review of the
    chief’s decision by the Ontario
    Civilian Commission on Police Services (OCCOPS) and an appeal to
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  Section 58 also<i> </i>empowers the chief of police to resolve disciplinary matters by
    informal resolution, rather than proceed with discipline charges against
    officers, where it is determined that their conduct is not of a serious nature.  In addition, under s. 73(1), OCCOPS has the
    jurisdiction to direct a chief of police to process a complaint or assign the
    review of a complaint to another police force.  Section 64(7) provides for the hearing of a complaint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it is clear on the record that the
    essential character of this dispute involves discipline.  We say this because, by the time the officers
    signed their consent to the discipline, they knew that the Chief intended that
    the disciplinary action could be used in relation to their future career
    aspirations.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  It was for this reason that the officers
    unilaterally qualified their consent.  Accordingly,
    the focus of the dispute was essentially about the consequences of the
    discipline and not about the breach of an agreement.  In other words, if the Chief had conceded
    that there would be no consequences for the officers’ careers, the dispute would
    have been over.  The dispute about the
    purported agreement was relevant only to the extent it affected the overriding
    issue of the consequences of the discipline.  As such, it stood to be resolved under the statutory scheme of the <i>Police Services Act</i>; it was not a matter
    for the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent contends that the application, as
    amended, remains within the court’s jurisdiction because it also alleges
    several tort claims, including deceit, misfeasance in public office, negligent
    and/or fraudulent misrepresentation and abuse of public office.  However, the tort claims were added only
    after the appellants brought their motion to dismiss.  Importantly, although the respondent added
    the new causes of action, it did not amend the supporting affidavit, which only
    made bald speculative allegations in the nature of a conspiracy theory.  In our view, these amendments were tactical
    and designed to obfuscate the true nature of the dispute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the respondent’s counsel conceded in
    argument that the tort issue raised in the amended application stands or falls
    with our determination of the essential issue between the parties.  We agree.  In our view, the additional tort relief claimed does not take the claim
    outside of its essential character as a matter of discipline.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To recapitulate, the essential issue between the
    parties is one of discipline.  The court
    is without jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we
    would allow the appeal and dismiss the application in its entirety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no reason why costs should not follow the event.
     Costs of the appeal are awarded to the
    appellants in the agreed-upon total amount of $10,000, inclusive of
