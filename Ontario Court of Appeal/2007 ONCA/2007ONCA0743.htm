  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal addresses the applicability of the two-year limitation period set
    out in s. 4 of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B to
    an application for an order directing the assessment of a solicitor’s accounts
    brought pursuant to s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15.  The
    appellant, Peter J. Doucet (“Doucet”), a lawyer, argues that s. 4 of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> applies and that the application brought by his former client, Laureine
    Guillemette (“Guillemette”) was out of time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge rejected this submission and directed that the accounts
    be assessed.  I agree with his conclusion and would dismiss the appeal.  In
    my view, the special circumstances exception in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> applies to Guillemette’s application and permits the commencement
    of the application for a Reference to assess costs beyond the two year limitation
    period found in the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  In addition, were it necessary
    to do so, I would hold that under the terms of the transitional provisions
    in s. 24(5) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, the limitation period in the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> applies since Guillemette’s claim was discovered by her prior to
    January 1, 2004.  The claim was not time barred under that statute.</p>

  <h4>The Facts</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    unexpectedly, in a dispute over a lawyer’s accounts, the lawyer and the client
    have very different versions of many of the relevant events.  In directing
    an assessment, the application judge concluded that the material before him
    provided the requisite “special circumstances” warranting an assessment despite
    the passage of almost three years from the payment of the accounts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    finding of “special circumstances” turns on a fact driven exercise of judicial
    discretion.  This court will defer to that discretion absent an error in
    principle or a clearly unreasonable result:  <i>Plazavest Financial Corporation
    et. al. v. National Bank of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  I see no basis upon which to interfere with the application judge’s exercise
    of his discretion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I would not interfere with the finding of special circumstances, it is not
    necessary for me to review much of the conflicting evidence placed before
    the application judge.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  I observe, however, that some factual disputes
    between Doucet and Guillemette remain outstanding and will be resolved at
    the assessment.  I need review only the facts relevant to the limitation
    period argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Guillemette
    retained Doucet in mid-December 2002 to act for her in a matrimonial dispute.  She
    signed a written retainer.  Doucet acted for Guillemette until June 2003.  Over
    the six months of his retainer, he delivered several accounts to Guillemette
    totalling about $31,000.  All of the accounts were paid in a timely fashion.  The
    last account was paid before the end of June 2003.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    did not go smoothly between Guillemette and Doucet.  She regularly complained
    about the amount of his bills.  She withheld payment on occasion and Doucet
    threatened to stop working on her behalf if she did not pay the accounts
    immediately.  As he put it:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>You are required
    to pay all of my accounts as rendered in accordance with our retainer agreement.  If
    you stop paying my accounts, I will stop working for you.  It is that simple.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Guillemette’s
    health was not good between December 2002 and June 2003.  She had various
    physical problems and was abusing pain medication.  She ended up in the hospital
    in September 2003.  According to her, it was almost a year before she was
    physically able to look after her affairs and some considerable additional
    time before she could “gain control of [her] life”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Guillemette
    indicated that after receiving and paying Doucet’s last account in June 2003,
    she went to another lawyer she knew for assistance in assessing Doucet’s
    accounts.  She believed that the accounts were much too high.  A secretary
    in that lawyer’s office told Guillemette that she should hire a lawyer in
    Cochrane, where Doucet’s office was located, to assist her in assessing his
    accounts.  Guillemette did not take any further steps to initiate the assessment
    and in September 2003 she was hospitalized.  She contended that she was physically
    and emotionally unable to initiate the application until 2006. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    application for an assessment was commenced in March 2006, about thirty-three
    months after Guillemette received and paid Doucet’s last account.  </p>

  <h4>The Relevant Legislation</h4>
  <h2>(a)  The <i>Solicitors Act</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    client may challenge his or her solicitor’s accounts by way of an assessment.  The
    provisions of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> governing applications for assessments
    are notoriously unclear:  see <i>Fiset v. Falconer</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 4023
    at para. 24 (Sup.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ct.).  Sections 4 and 11 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> are in issue on this
    appeal.  The present s. 11 came into force on January 1, 2004 as one of many
    amendments made to various statutes when the new <i>Limitations Act</i> came
    into force:  <i>Limitations Act</i>, 2002 s. 46.  The predecessor to s. 11
    is also germane to this appeal.  The relevant provisions are set out below:</p>
  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to the amendment to s. 11, the case law revealed some confusion as to the
    interaction of ss. 4 and 11 on applications pertaining to accounts that had
    been paid more than twelve months before the application for an assessment
    was made.  In <i>Fellowes, McNeil v. Kansa Canadian Management Services Inc. </i>(1997),
    34 O.R. (3d) 301 at 302 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>The <i>Solicitors
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15 makes no provision for the assessment of
      accounts paid more than 12 months before the application is made.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Enterprise
      Rent-a-Car Co. v. Shapiro, Andrews, Finlayson</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)
      257 at 260 (C.A.), this court held that s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>,
      which permits assessments beyond twelve months after delivery if “special
      circumstances” are shown, applies to both paid and unpaid accounts:  See
      also <i>Fiset v. Falconer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 35-37 which adopts
      the position taken in <i>Fellowes</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    amendment to s. 11 deletes the requirement that the application for the assessment
    of a paid account be made “within 12 months after payment”.  Section 11 no
    longer imposes any time limit on the bringing of the application for an assessment
    of the paid accounts.  The present s. 11, however, maintains the requirement
    that in all cases where the client seeks to assess paid accounts, the client
    must demonstrate “special circumstances”.  The “special circumstances” requirement
    reflects the commonsense inference that payment of an account implies an
    acceptance of the reasonableness of the account:  <i>Enterprise Rent-a-Car
    Co. v. Shapiro, Andrews, Finlayson</i>,<i> supra</i> at 265, <i>Re Randell
    and Robins and Robins</i> (1979), 22 O.R. (2d) 642 at 643 (H.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> was not amended by the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  The
    twelve month time period that runs from the delivery of the accounts applies
    to all accounts whether paid or unpaid, as does the “special circumstances” exception
    to that twelve month time limit.  Consequently, an application to assess
    paid accounts brought more than twelve months after delivery of those accounts
    is subject to the “special circumstances” requirements in both ss. 4 and
    11. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “special
    circumstances” that are relevant to a decision to allow an assessment of
    a paid account will overlap with the “special circumstances” that are relevant
    to the decision to permit an assessment more than twelve months after delivery
    of the account.  The “special circumstances” will not, however, necessarily
    be identical.  For example, the fact that an account was paid under a mistake
    may be relevant to the “special circumstances” required by s. 11 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, but not to the “special circumstances” required in s. 4.  Similarly,
    a disabling illness suffered after payment of the account may constitute
    a “special circumstance”
    under s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, but have no relevance to the “special
    circumstance” inquiry under s. 11.  </p>

    19 reflects the legislature’s intention to jettison the numerous limitation
    provisions scattered throughout the statutes in favour of the generally applicable
    provisions found in the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  With the exception of the
    statutes identified in s. 19(1), that section negates the operation of limitation
    periods found in other statutes if the claim in issue is one to which the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> applies.  The <i>Solicitors Act</i> is not listed in the Schedule
    referred to in s. 19(1) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, and does not incorporate
    by reference any of the statutes listed in that Schedule.  Consequently,
    and subject to the transitional provisions in s. 24 of the <i>Limitations

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Limitations

      in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario in part by fixing two generally applicable limitation periods, the
    basic limitation period of two years (s. 4) and an ultimate limitation period
    of 15 years (s.15).  The Act, however, recognizes that these generally applicable
    limitation periods cannot apply in all circumstances and to all claims.  Under
    the <i>Limitations Act</i>, some claims have no limitation period (s.16),
    some claims remained subject to the limitation periods set out in other statutes
    (s. 19), and some remain subject to limitation provisions in other statutes
    during the transition period referred to in s. 24.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> places a further qualification on the application
    of the limitations periods set out in the Act.  Section 20 provides that
    nothing in the <i>Limitations Act</i> will affect a provision in another
    act which extends, suspends or otherwise varies the limitation period found
    in another Act.  Section 20 recognizes that individual statutes may provide
    for situations or conditions in which the limitation provisions in those
    statutes should be extended or modified.  Those provisions may well be particularly
    apt for the limitation period addressed in that specific statute.  The <i>Limitations
    Act</i> does not seek to standardize the circumstances in which limitation
    periods can be extended, suspended or otherwise varied by statute.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    think the “special circumstances” qualifier in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> falls within s. 20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  The twelve month
    time period in s. 4 has repeatedly been described as a limitation period:  see
    e.g. <i>Enterprise Rent-a-Car Co. v. Shapiro, Andrews, Finlayson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 260-261.  Where
    “special circumstances” exist, the court will order an assessment beyond
    twelve months after delivery of the account, thereby effectively extending,
    suspending or otherwise varying the twelve month time limit set out in s.
    4.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    while by virtue of s. 19 of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, the two year limitation
    period in that Act trumps the twelve month limitation period in s. 4, s.
    20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> preserves the
    “special circumstances” exception set out in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    my analysis to this case, Guillemette had to show special circumstances before
    an assessment could be ordered because she was seeking to assess an account
    that had been paid: <i>Solicitors Act</i>, s. 11.  Guillemette also had to
    show special circumstances because she was seeking an assessment more than
    two years after the delivery of the accounts:  <i>Limitations Act</i>, s.
    4; <i>Solicitors Act</i>, s. 4.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    appreciate that my interpretation of the interaction of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> and the <i>Solicitors Act</i> means that there is no absolute time
    bar against applications for the assessment of lawyers’ accounts.  This result
    may seem inconsistent with the purpose underlying the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  However,
    solicitors’ accounts have always been treated differently than other debts
    and even other professional accounts.  A superior court has an inherent jurisdiction
    to review lawyers’ accounts entirely apart from any statutory authority.  That
    inherent jurisdiction was not subject to a time limit.  My interpretation
    of the two Acts preserves that <i>status quo</i>:  see <i>Rooney et al. v.
    Jasinski</i>, [1952] O.R. 869 at 875 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    passage of time, particularly a lengthy time period after a bill has been
    paid, will be a significant consideration in exercising the “special circumstances” discretion
    in both ss. 4 and 11 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  Time alone will not,
    however, preclude the examination of the suitability of a lawyer’s accounts
    where other circumstances compel a review of those accounts. </p>

    if s. 20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> does not preserve the
    “special circumstances” exemption found in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>,
    I would hold that the transitional provision in the <i>Limitations Act</i> forecloses
    the operation of the two year limitation period set out in s. 4 of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>.  </p>

    24 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> speaks to actions commenced after January
    1, 2004 where the claim is based on an act or omission that took place before
    January 1, 2004.  The transitional rules are found in s. 24(5).  This case
    fits within s. 24(5) in that the limitation under the <i>Solicitors Act</i> had
    not expired as of January 1, 2004 and the limitation period in the <i>Limitations
    Act</i> would have applied had Guillemette’s claim been based on acts that
    took place after January 1, 2004.  </p>

    question of whether the limitation provision in the <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    or the limitation provision in the <i>Solicitors Act</i> applies turns on
    when the claim was discovered.  Rule 1 in s. 24(5) speaks to those cases
    where the claim is discovered after January 1, 2004.  The <i>Limitations
    Act</i> provisions apply to those claims.  Rule 2 speaks to claims discovered
    before January 1, 2004.  The former legislation, in this case the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, applies to those claims.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Guillemette
    contended that she had decided she had been overcharged by Doucet and wanted
    to assess his accounts by late June 2003.  It is difficult to suggest that
    she had not discovered the claim by the end of June 2003 when she went to
    a lawyer seeking to commence an action against Doucet for recovery of some
    of those fees.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    any measure of discoverability, Guillemette knew of her claim against Doucet
    by the end of June, well before January 1, 2004.  Clearly, if the definition
    of discoverability provided in s. 5 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> guides
    the interpretation of discoverability for the purposes of s. 24(5), Guillemette
    had discovered her claim against Doucet when she went to another lawyer in
    June 2003.  By that time, the loss of which she complained, the money paid
    to Doucet, had occurred (s. 5(1)(a)(i)).  Also by that time, Guillemette
    had attributed her loss to Doucet’s actions (s. 5(1)(a)(ii)(iii)).  She had
    also decided that a legal proceeding was the appropriate means by which to
    remedy her loss (s. 5(1)(a)(iv)).  </p>

    claim was discovered before January 1, 2004.  Under the terms of s. 24(5)
    any limitation period imposed on her action against Doucet had to be found
    in the <i>Solicitors Act</i> and not the <i>Limitations Act</i>. Section
    4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> permitted the action assuming the judge found “special
