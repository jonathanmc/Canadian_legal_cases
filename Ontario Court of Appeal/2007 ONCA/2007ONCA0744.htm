  <h2>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown breached its fiduciary duty to the Whitefish Lake Band of Indians 120
    years ago.  The issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in
    his assessment of compensation for that breach.  The facts of this case are
    straightforward.  Its resolution is not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whitefish
    occupies a reserve near
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sudbury.  In 1886 Whitefish surrendered the timber rights on its reserve
    to the Crown, which then sold these rights for $316.  In 2002, Whitefish
    sued the Crown for damages for an improvident sale.  Shortly before the trial,
    the Crown admitted that it breached its fiduciary duty by failing to obtain
    a fair value for Whitefish’s timber rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, Blenus Wright J., was then asked to assess Whitefish’s compensation
    for the Crown’s admitted breach.  To do so, he had to determine two issues:
    first, what was the fair value of the timber rights in 1886; and second,
    how is that fair value to be assessed in 2005, the date of trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first issue, the trial judge valued Whitefish’s timbers right in 1886
    at $31,600.  He did so by choosing the highest price paid for comparable
    timber at a public auction.  On the second issue, the trial judge assessed
    Whitefish’s compensation at $1,095,888.  In doing so he took into account
    that the Crown had not profited from its breach of duty and that it had no
    legal obligation to pay prejudgment interest until 1992.  He adjusted the
    fair value of the timber rights for inflation between 1886 and 1992, and
    awarded simple interest on that adjusted amount from 1992 to 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whitefish
    appeals the trial judge’s valuation on the first issue and the Crown cross-appeals.  Whitefish
    contends that the trial judge erred by failing to accept reliable evidence
    from its own expert, who placed the value of the timber rights in 1886 at
    $50,000.  The Crown contends that the trial judge erred by failing to use
    a weighted average of the valuations of its expert, which would have produced
    a figure of $16,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the second issue, Whitefish, supported by the intervenors, contends that
    the trial judge erred in three related ways.  First, it says that the trial
    judge erred by failing to compensate it in equity for its lost opportunity
    to have the $31,600 invested for its benefit, and to have the use of the
    investment income; second, it says that the trial judge erred in law by holding
    that he could not include compound interest as an element of equitable compensation;
    and,  third,  it says that the trial judge’s finding that the sale proceeds
    would have been
    “dissipated” is contrary to the terms of the surrender, the provisions of
    the <i>Indian Act</i>, R.S.C. 1886, c. 43, and the principles of equitable
    compensation, and is unsupported by the evidence.  Whitefish claims that
    an award that fairly compensates it for the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty
    would be in the range of $23 million.  The Crown contends that the trial
    judge’s use of inflation and simple prejudgment interest achieved a
    “fair, equitable and proportionate award” of compensation in an historical
    claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first issue, I would not give effect either to Whitefish’s appeal or
    the Crown’s cross-appeal.  The trial judge did not err in principle in valuing
    the timber rights in 1886 at $31,600 and I would defer to his valuation.  On
    the second issue, however, I agree with Whitefish’s three arguments.  I would
    allow the appeal on this issue and set aside the trial judge’s award.  Because
    the record is insufficient, this court cannot substitute its own award for
    that of the trial judge.  I would order a new hearing to determine the equitable
    compensation to which Whitefish is entitled.</p>
  <h2>B.        BACKGROUND FACTS </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whitefish
    established the facts and the context for its claim through historical documents.  Most
    of these documents came from government archives.  They were assembled by
    two historians, one from each side.</p>
  <h2>a)         The Robinson-Huron Treaty and the Whitefish Reserve </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1850, Whitefish signed the Robinson-Huron Treaty, ceding all its land to
    the Crown, except for the Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve.  This reserve is
    located in northern
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, approximately 19 kilometres west of the city of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sudbury, and in 1886 comprised seventy-nine square miles.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Today the Whitefish First Nation has 800 members;
    350 live on the reserve.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly
    for this appeal, the Treaty provided that should the “Chiefs and their respective
    Tribes” wish to dispose of any part of their reserve, or of any valuable “production” on
    it, the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs would sell or lease it at
    their request “for their sole benefit, and to the best advantage”.  </p>
  <h2>b)        Whitefish’s Surrender of its Timber Rights </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    a series of forest fires had swept through the Sudbury District in 1872,
    by October 27, 1885, James Phipps, the Indian Agent responsible for Whitefish,
    reported to Sir John A. MacDonald, the Prime Minister and Superintendent-General
    of Indian Affairs, that “there still remains a large quantity of Pine [on]
    the Whitefish reserve.”  Phipps added that “if [the timber was] realized
    to the best advantage [it] will be of great benefit to the Indians.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    government then took steps to encourage Whitefish to surrender its timber
    rights to the Crown.  In November 1885, Phipps wrote to the Chief suggesting
    that it was in Whitefish’s best interest to do so.  In January 1886, the
    Prime Minister instructed his staff to secure the surrender of the timber
    rights.  In his view it was in the band’s interest that the timber be sold
    before it was destroyed by fire.  In July 1886, Phipps wrote to the Prime
    Minister to report that Whitefish had surrendered its timber rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    surrender document stipulated that Whitefish had surrendered “the whole of
    the merchantable timber” on terms that “ten per cent of the bonus derivable
    from the sale of the said timber [is] to be divided among the said band, <u>the
    remainder of the proceeds [are] to be invested for our sole joint benefit
    and for the benefit of our descendants</u> in such manner as to the said
    Government of Canada shall seem to be most conducive to the interest of our
    said band.” [Emphasis added.]  Thus, by the terms of the surrender, the Crown
    agreed to distribute ten per cent of the sale proceeds to members of the
    band and to invest the remaining ninety per cent for the benefit of present
    and future band members.</p>
  <h2>c)         The Crown’s

    Sale of the Timber Rights </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the fall of 1885, two men, Honoré Robillard, a Conservative member of the
    Ontario Provincial Legislature, and Joseph Riopelle, head of a well-known
    lumbering firm, expressed an interest in acquiring a licence to cut timber
    on the Whitefish reserve.  In October 1885, Riopelle applied for a timber
    licence.  Later correspondence from the Department of Indian Affairs regarding
    the timber licence was addressed to Robillard and answered by him.  In this
    correspondence, Riopelle was referred to as Robillard’s partner.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Prime Minister decided that the timber rights should be sold to Robillard.  On
    October 14, 1886 the government sold the licence to Robillard for a “bonus” of
    $316 or $4 per square mile.  The money was deposited into the Whitefish trust
    account maintained by the government.  The government did not hold a public
    auction or any other competitive process.  At the time $4 per square mile
    was the standard rate the federal government charged for timber licences,
    whether for reserve land or Crown land.  </p>
  <h2>d)        The Furor Over the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale to Robillard </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Within
    a year of the sale to Robillard, the licence was assigned twice – first to
    Alexander Barnet, reportedly for $43,000, and then to J.H. Francis, reportedly
    for between $50,000 to $55,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    reported prices triggered a political furor.  In June 1887, soon after the
    licence was assigned to Francis, John Barron, an opposition Liberal member
    of Parliament, raised concerns in the House of Commons about the sale of
    the licence to Robillard.  In February 1888, a periodical, <i>The Canada
    Lumberman</i>, reported that Robillard had resold the timber rights for $55,000.  In
    January 1889, <i>The Toronto Globe</i> published an article entitled “Swindled
    Indians”, which criticized the amount Robillard had paid for the licence
    and the lack of a public auction.</p>

    April 1889, the controversy resurfaced in the House of Commons.  Barron claimed
    that Robillard had profited improperly, earning as much as $50,000 from the
    flip of the licence.  Robillard, however, denied that he had received anything.  Finally,
    in June 1891, <i>The Canada Lumberman</i> wrote that Robillard had sold his
    half interest in the licence for $15,500 and that Riopelle had later sold
    his half interest for $27,500.</p>

    2004, Whitefish brought a motion in this action for partial summary judgment.  The
    motion was resolved by minutes of settlement signed by both sides.  Two important

    in principle it owed a fiduciary duty to Whitefish and Whitefish acknowledged
    that “the scope and nature of that fiduciary obligation” was to be determined
    by the trial judge.  The Crown’s admission was grounded in the case law.  Because
    it assumed discretionary control over Whitefish’s timber rights, it had a
    fiduciary obligation to act in the band’s best interest when dealing with
    those rights.  See <i>Haida Nation v.

  <h2>C.        ANALYSIS </h2>
  <h2>First Issue: Did the trial judge err in determining that the fair value

    produced the opinion evidence of Bruce Byford, an experienced professional
    forester.  Byford looked at the Crown’s historical timber harvest records.  He
    concluded that the “bonuses” of $43,000 and $55,000 reportedly paid by Barnet
    and Francis for the timber licence represented a reasonable estimate of its
    fair value in 1886.  He said that the licence was likely worth about $50,000.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sandy concluded that the value of the timber licence in 1886 fell between
    $12,600 and $19,400.  He reached that conclusion by comparing nine timber
    sales near Whitefish between 1881 and 1886.  These timber sales ranged from
    a bonus of $0.45 per square mile to a bonus of $400 per square mile.  He
    then calculated the weighted average of all nine sales – $159.22 per square
    mile – to arrive at his fair value figure of $12,600 (79 X $159.22).  He
    calculated the weighted average of the five sales that took place in 1885 – $245.54 – to
    arrive at his fair value figure of $19,400 (79 X $245.54).</p>

    Sandy that the prices obtained in the comparable sales should be averaged

    judge chose the highest comparable sale price – $400 per square mile – which
    yielded a fair value for Whitefish’s timber rights of $31,600 (79 X $400).  The
    trial judge justified his use of the highest comparable sale price on two
    grounds: the government failed to examine how much timber was on the Whitefish
    reserve, and the government failed to investigate whether Robillard had paid
    too little for the licence.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sandy’s weighted average figure and instead using the highest comparable
    sale price.  The Crown had a fiduciary obligation to sell Whitefish’s timber
    rights at fair value, or in the words of the Treaty, to “the best advantage”.  Consistent
    with that obligation it should have investigated whether it had obtained
    fair value once reports surfaced about the later sales to Barnet and Francis.  The
    Crown’s failure to undertake more than a perfunctory investigation by itself
    supported the trial judge’s use of the highest comparable figure.  I would
    not give effect to the appeal or the cross-appeal on the first issue.</p>
  <h2>Second Issue: Did the trial judge err in his assessment of Whitefish’s
    compensation? </h2>
  <h2>a)         The trial judge’s award and the parties’ positions on appeal </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, Whitefish sought equitable compensation for the loss of its opportunity
    to invest the fair value of its timber rights.  It contended that the court
    should presume the sale proceeds would have been invested in the Whitefish
    trust account maintained by the government, where it would have earned compound
    interest.  It relied on an expert’s report, which, based on an 1886 valuation
    of $31,600 for its timber rights, assessed the band’s compensation in 2005
    at approximately $23 million.  The Crown contended that Whitefish would be
    fairly compensated by awarding it in 2005 the amount of money it should have
    been paid in 1886 adjusted for inflation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge substantially accepted the Crown’s contention.  He adjusted the
    figure of $31,600 for increases in the Consumer Price Index between 1887
    and 1992.  In 1992, amendments to the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 obligated the Crown to pay prejudgment interest
    on money that it owed in accordance with provincial legislation.  The trial
    judge therefore took the 1992 inflation adjusted figure and on that amount
    allowed simple prejudgment interest of five per cent per year to the date
    of trial.  The total compensation he awarded equalled $1,095,888 plus costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected Whitefish’s claim for unrealized investment income for
    three reasons.  First, he rejected Whitefish’s position that the $31,600
    would have been deposited in the trust account and remained there.  In his
    view, that position was “highly improbable”
    and “not realistic”.  Instead he found it likely that the $31,600 would have
    been deposited in the trust account and then
    “dissipated” within a reasonable time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge concluded that the payment of compound interest before 1992
    was precluded by the Crown’s historical immunity from paying interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judge concluded that compound interest in equity was not available
    because the Crown did not wrongly convert trust funds for its own use and
    did not benefit from any breach of its duty.  In the trial judge’s words, “it
    simply failed to perform its duty”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, Whitefish submits that each of the three reasons the trial judge
    gave for denying it equitable compensation reflects an error in principle.  Whitefish
    acknowledges that the court should award an amount that is
    “fair and proportionate”, but says that, as a starting point, it should use
    the amount generated by investing $31,600 in the trust account at compound
    rates of interest.  That starting point, Whitefish argues, gives effect to
    the provisions of the <i>Indian</i> <i>Act</i>, the Treaty and the surrender,
    to the government’s practice, and to equity’s presumption that the money
    Whitefish should have been paid would have been put to the most profitable
    use.  If this court agrees that the trial judge committed a reviewable error,
    Whitefish asks us to fix the compensation to which it is entitled, rather
    than send its claim back for a new trial or an assessment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that the trial judge’s approach and his award were fair and
    proportionate.  However, if this court disagrees, like Whitefish, the Crown
    asks us to fix compensation rather than order a new hearing.  </p>
  <h2>b)        My approach </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons that I will elaborate on, I agree that Whitefish is entitled to equitable
    compensation for the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty.  It is entitled to
    be put in the position it would have been in but for the Crown’s breach.  Had
    the Crown fulfilled its fiduciary duty, it would have invested ninety per
    cent of the $31,600 in the Whitefish trust account.  That money would have
    earned investment income, which would have been available for Whitefish and
    its members.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s award does not fairly compensate Whitefish for the money the
    Crown failed to obtain, invest, and hold for Whitefish and its members.  It
    does not do so because it is tainted by the three errors Whitefish alleges.  That
    the Crown did not profit from its breach does not preclude taking compound
    interest into account as an element of equitable compensation.  That the
    Crown was not obliged to pay prejudgment interest similarly does not preclude
    an award of compound interest as an element of equitable compensation.  And
    a finding that any money invested would soon have been “dissipated” is both
    unsupported by the record before the trial judge and contrary to the principles
    governing equitable compensation.  Because the trial judge’s award is tainted
    by these three errors in principle, it cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ordinarily,
    the appropriate remedy is a new hearing or a reference on compensation.  Neither
    side, however, want a new hearing, and both have urged us to fix compensation
    doing the best we can with the available evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the evidentiary record and the expert reports provided an adequate footing
    to fix an appropriate award, I would attempt what the parties have asked
    us to do.  However, the record is either silent or inadequate on so many
    considerations relevant to a “fair and proportionate” award, that to do justice
    to both parties a new hearing is required.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do, however, have sufficient evidence on some matters.  For example, as a
    starting point, I think we can assume that the Crown would have complied
    with the terms of the surrender by distributing ten per cent of the $31,600
    to the members of the band and investing ninety per cent in the Whitefish
    trust account.  Also, the record does show that at least since 1969, money
    in band trust accounts earned compound interest at rates prescribed by successive
    Orders-in-Council.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Beyond
    that, the record is meagre, conflicting, or non-existent.  For example, we
    do not know definitively whether money in the account earned compound interest
    for the entire 120 year period, or only for part of that period.  Also, as
    we only have account records for four years, we do not know how much money
    remained in the account over that period, how much was spent annually, and
    what it was spent on.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    the record is unsatisfactory, I would order a new hearing limited to determining
    the award of equitable compensation Whitefish was entitled to in 2005 for
    the Crown’s failure to obtain $31,600 for Whitefish’s timber rights in 1886.  In
    the last section of these reasons, I will set out some of the matters the
    parties may wish to address at the new hearing.</p>
  <h2>c)         Whitefish is entitled to equitable compensation for its lost
    opportunity to invest the fair value of its timber rights and receive the
    investment income </h2>

    submits that it is entitled to equitable compensation for the Crown’s breach
    of fiduciary duty.  Whitefish further submits that an award of equitable
    compensation should recognize its lost opportunity to have the fair value
    of its timber rights invested for its benefit, and to receive the investment
    income for its use and the use of its members.  It contends that the trial
    judge erred in principle by failing to award any compensation for this lost
    opportunity caused by the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty. </p>

    compensation and common law damages differ in three important ways bearing
    on this appeal: first, while the purpose of equitable compensation is to
    put the plaintiff in the position it would have been in but for the breach,
    the purpose of common law damages is to restore the plaintiff to its original
    position; second, equitable compensation is assessed at the date of trial
    while common law damages are assessed at the date of the breach; and third,
    equity presumes that the trust funds will be invested in the most profitable
    way or put to the most advantageous use.  See Oosterhoff, <i>supra</i>.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    as I have said, Whitefish submits that an award of equitable compensation
    should recognize its lost opportunity to have invested the asset it was deprived
    of – the fair value of its timber rights – and to receive the income on that
    investment.  It contends that the trial judge erred in principle by failing
    to award any compensation for this lost investment opportunity, and therefore
    did not restore it to the position it would have been in if the Crown had
    fulfilled its fiduciary duty.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this is an appropriate case to award equitable compensation.  Modern
    jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized that remedies
    for breaches of fiduciary duty should be flexible.  Not every breach of fiduciary
    duty attracts the remedy of equitable compensation: see <i>Canson</i> at
    574-575.  The remedy chosen should be the most appropriate one on the facts
    of the case.  In considering the appropriate remedy, the court should look
    at the harm suffered from the breach: see <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994]
    3 S.C.R. 377.  Or, in the words of Binnie J. in <i>Cadbury Schweppes Inc.
    v. FBI Foods Ltd.</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 142 at para. 26, the remedy must meet “underlying
    policy objectives.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, there are two compelling, and indeed, unanswerable justifications
    for awarding Whitefish equitable compensation, measured by its lost opportunity
    to have the fair value of its timber rights invested by the government and
    to receive the investment income.  The first is the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    holding in <i>Canson</i> that a fiduciary’s discretionary control of a beneficiary’s
    property attracts an award of equitable compensation.  The second is the
    Supreme Court of Canada’s affirmation of an award of equitable compensation
    in <i>Guerin</i> on facts similar to those in the present case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under <i>Canson</i>,
    when a fiduciary who has discretionary control of a beneficiary’s property
    breaches its duty to the beneficiary, an award of equitable compensation
    is justified.  Thus, here, the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty when it had
    discretionary control over the sale of Whitefish’s timber rights and the
    sale proceeds rightfully attracts an award of equitable compensation.  Moreover,
    the appropriateness of equitable compensation is reinforced by two related
    considerations: the nature of the fiduciary duty that was breached, and the
    nexus between the breach and the loss.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his majority judgment in <i>Canson</i> at 578, La Forest J. drew a distinction – a “sharp
    divide” –
    between two classes of fiduciary duties.  In one class are cases where the
    property in question belongs to the beneficiary but is controlled by the
    fiduciary.  In the other class are cases where the fiduciary is merely required
    to perform its duty honestly and in accordance with its undertaking.  La
    Forest J. stressed that these two classes of cases engage different policy
    objectives.  Only in the first class of cases where the fiduciary controls
    the property of the beneficiary and equity’s concern is to compensate for
    what the property would be worth, should equity use its well recognized flexibility
    to achieve a different and fairer result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whitefish
    can legitimately claim the benefit of equity’s remedial flexibility because
    the Crown directed the sale of the band’s timber rights and had discretionary
    control over the sale proceeds.  Both the <i>Indian</i> <i>Act</i>, 1886
    and the Treaty prohibited Whitefish from selling its timber rights directly
    to a third party.  The Crown was interposed between Whitefish and the purchaser
    (Robillard) for the historical purpose of preventing the band from being
    exploited.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    once it agreed to sell its timber rights, Whitefish surrendered those rights
    to the Crown.  Under the Treaty, the Crown was obliged to sell these rights
    to “the best advantage”.  The Crown sold the rights to Robillard and received
    the sale proceeds.  Section 70 of the <i>Indian</i> <i>Act</i>, 1886 and
    the surrender similarly obliged the Crown to invest the proceeds for the
    benefit of the band members and their descendants.  The Crown met this obligation
    by depositing the proceeds in a trust account, which it maintained and controlled
    for the benefit of Whitefish.  Unquestionably, the Crown had discretionary
    control over the sale of Whitefish’s timber rights and the proceeds received
    from that sale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s fiduciary duty to our Aboriginal people is of overarching importance
    in this country.  One way of recognizing its importance is to award equitable
    compensation for its breach.  The remedy of equitable compensation best furthers
    the objectives of enforcement and deterrence.  It signals the emphasis the
    court places on the Crown’s ongoing obligation to honour its fiduciary duty
    and the need to deter future breaches.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nexus between the Crown’s breach and Whitefish’s loss also supports an award
    of equitable compensation.  In some breach of fiduciary duty cases – <i>Canson</i> is
    an example – equitable compensation will not be warranted because there is
    no direct connection between the breach and the loss.  In this case, however,
    the Crown’s discretionary control over the sale and the sale proceeds led
    directly to the Whitefish’s loss.  Equitable compensation is thus the appropriate
    remedy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second justification for an award of equitable compensation is the Supreme
    Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Guerin</i>.  In <i>Guerin</i>, the most
    directly applicable case, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the trial
    judge’s application of trust principles in awarding an Aboriginal band equitable
    compensation for the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty.  The facts giving
    rise to the Crown’s breach were straightforward.  The Crown leased surrendered
    reserve land to a golf club on terms less favourable than those authorized
    by the band.  The trial judge, Collier J., then had to decide the band’s
    compensation for the Crown’s breach.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    concluded that the band should be compensated for its lost opportunity to
    develop the surrendered land in the most advantageous way, which in his view
    was as a residential subdivision.  His award of $10 million was upheld by
    the Supreme Court of Canada.  In his majority decision at 386, Dickson J.
    said that although the Crown was not a trustee, its fiduciary duty to the
    Aboriginal people was “trust-like”.   Thus, compensation for a breach of
    its duty should be measured by principles similar to those that govern the
    law of trusts.  And, in her concurring reasons, at 361-3, Wilson J. endorsed
    the compensatory nature of the remedy given by the trial judge – the lost
    opportunity for residential development because of the Crown’s breach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Guerin</i> concerned
    land and <i>Whitefish</i> concerns timber rights.  But, in substance, Whitefish’s
    claim in this case is no different from the band’s claim in <i>Guerin</i>.  Each
    band sought equitable compensation measured by the lost opportunity to use
    its asset because of the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty.  In <i>Guerin</i>,
    the lost opportunity was the opportunity to develop its land.  In <i>Whitefish</i>,
    the lost opportunity was the opportunity to sell its timber rights at market
    value, to have the proceeds of the sale invested by the government in an
    interest bearing trust account, and to receive the investment income.  Equitable
    compensation was awarded to the band in <i>Guerin</i>.  It should be awarded
    to Whitefish in this case as well.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    failing to apply the principles from <i>Canson</i> and <i>Guerin</i>, the
    trial judge committed a fundamental and reviewable error.  Even so, the Crown
    argues, we should not disturb the trial judge’s award for two reasons: first,
    even in equity, the Crown cannot be liable for compound interest; and, second,
    the trial judge’s finding of “dissipation” is reasonable.  Therefore, the
    Crown submits, the trial judge’s award of approximately $1 million is a generous
    award for the Crown’s breach.  I will deal with these two issues raised by
    the Crown.</p>
  <h2>d)        Equitable compensation for the Crown’s breach can include the
    payment of compound interest  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Whitefish
    argues that its lost opportunity was the opportunity to have the $31,600
    invested in the trust account maintained by the government for its benefit.  It
    submits that investment would have earned compound interest at rates prescribed
    by successive Orders-in-Council.  Whitefish says that at least as a starting
    point, the accumulated amount of capital and interest is the equitable compensation
    to which it is entitled.  In other words, Whitefish is not seeking merely
    the money that it should have had in 1886, which is substantially what the
    trial judge awarded.  Instead, it claims the amount that the money, if invested
    at compound rates of interest, would have generated with the passage of time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    course, both compound interest and simple interest account for the time value
    of money.  The difference between the two is this: compound interest is interest
    on the accumulated principal and interest; simple interest is interest on
    the principal alone.  See <i>Bank of
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that an award of equitable compensation cannot include compound
    interest.  It makes two points in support of its position.  First, it says
    Whitefish is not entitled to compound interest in equity because, as the
    trial judge found, the Crown did not deliberately breach its fiduciary duty
    and it did not profit from its breach.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown says Whitefish’s lost opportunity was the loss of use of the money
    ($31,600) in 1886.  Ordinarily, a plaintiff is compensated for loss of use
    of money by an award of prejudgment interest on that money.  However, because
    of the Crown’s common law and historic immunity from paying interest, such
    an award – whether simple interest or compound interest – was not available
    against the Crown until 1992.  Therefore, by law, the trial judge was limited
    to awarding Whitefish compensation equivalent to what $31,600 was worth in
    2005.</p>

    will first discuss why I accept – with qualifications – Whitefish’s position.  I
    will then address the Crown’s contrary arguments.  </p>

    on the Crown by statute and the surrender, in the way the Crown managed money
    derived from the sale of reserve land or timber rights on reserve land, and
    in the principles of equitable compensation.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s statutory and surrender obligations dictate the starting point for
    fixing Whitefish’s compensation.  Both obligated the Crown to invest ninety
    per cent of the $31,600 for the benefit of Whitefish and its members.  The
    court should presume that the Crown would have honoured its legal obligations.</p>

    Crown’s practice in managing Indian money also dictates where it likely would
    have invested the money obtained from the sale of Whitefish’s timber rights.  It
    was the Crown’s practice to invest the proceeds of sale of timber rights
    on reserve land in a trust account it maintained and controlled for the band’s
    benefit.  That is what the Crown did with the $316 it received from the sale
    of Whitefish’s timber rights to Robillard.  Contemporaneous banking records
    produced at trial show that the Department of Indian Affairs maintained a
    Whitefish Lake Indians account, which was divided between capital and interest.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The record for the fiscal year ending June 30,
    1887 shows $316 in Whitefish’s capital account.  Undoubtedly, if the Crown
    had obtained $31,600 from the sale of Whitefish’s timber rights – as the
    trial judge found it should have – that amount, or more likely ninety per
    cent of that amount, would have been deposited in Whitefish’s capital account.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    give effect to what likely would have happened, I think it fair to assume
    that money in the Whitefish account would have earned interest at rates prescribed
    by successive Orders-in-Council and compounded for some, if not all, of the
    120 year period.  The evidence to support this assumption comes from the
    Manual for the Administration of Band Moneys, prepared by the federal government’s
    Indian Moneys Directorate and produced as an exhibit at trial.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Manual shows that the Crown used the market yields of long-term Government
    of Canada bonds as a basis for the interest it paid.  Appendix B to the Manual
    sets out the interest rates paid on Indian capital and revenue accounts from
    Confederation to the present.  These rates were, and continue to be, fixed
    periodically by Order-in-Council.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significantly,
    Appendix B also addresses how interest was calculated.  Appendix B states
    that from April 1, 1969 to March 31, 1980 interest on money in band capital
    and revenue accounts was compounded annually “and the resulting interest
    was credited to the Band Revenue Account in the beginning of the fiscal year”.  From
    April 1, 1980 forward, interest was compounded semi-annually.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the position that Whitefish urges on us must be qualified in two ways.  These
    qualifications are among the reasons why a new hearing is necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first qualification concerns whether the Crown paid compound interest on
    money in band trust accounts between 1886 and 1969.  The Manual itself does
    not address how interest was calculated before April 1, 1969.  However, two
    pieces of evidence do, and they are in conflict.    One piece of evidence
    appears in the report of David Cornfield of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, the
    expert retained by Whitefish to value its loss.  Cornfield’s report states
    that interest on band accounts has been compounded since Confederation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Appendix B of
    the Manual did not specify how interest was calculated prior to April 1,
    1969, but indicated that the annual interest rate was fixed by the Order-in-Council
    over this period.  However, based on a facsimile received and discussions
    held with representative of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs,
    it has been indicated to us that interest on Band Accounts has been calculated
    on a compound basis since Confederation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the Crown did not dispute this part of Cornfield’s report, the records in
    evidence for the Whitefish trust account do not seem to support his statement.  The
    Crown filed in evidence the Whitefish account records for only four fiscal
    years: the years ending June 30 of 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890.  As I have
    said, the records show that the $316 derived from the sale of Whitefish’s
    timber rights went into the capital account.  But, while the records explicitly
    show entries for “Interest on invested capital”, they show no entries for
    “Interest on invested interest”.  The records also do not show that the “Interest
    on invested capital” was put into the capital account to earn interest.  Whether
    the Crown paid or should have paid compound interest on band accounts for
    some or all of the period 1886 – 1969 is a matter that should be clarified
    at the new hearing. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second qualification concerns whether the annual interest that would have
    been earned on the invested sale proceeds of Whitefish’s timber rights would
    have stayed in the account to be compounded or would have been paid out to
    the band and its members.  I will return to this question when I deal with
    the trial judge’s finding of “dissipation”.  Here, I observe only that we
    cannot tell what likely would have happened over time because neither side

    a matter that should be clarified at a new hearing.</p>

    to these two qualifications, however, I think it fair to conclude that if
    the Crown had fulfilled its fiduciary duty in 1886, it would have received
    $31,600 for the sale of Whitefish’s timber rights; it would have deposited
    ninety per cent of that amount ($28,440) in Whitefish’s capital account;
    it would have paid interest on whatever money was in Whitefish’s account
    at rates stipulated by successive Orders-in-Council; and at least it would
    have compounded the interest annually between April 1, 1969 and March 31,
    1980, and semi-annually afterwards.  </p>

    likely scenario is also consistent with the principles of trust law, which,
    according to <i>Guerin</i>, govern Whitefish’s claim in equity.  It establishes
    a framework for restoring Whitefish to the position it would have been in
    but for the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty.  It results in an assessment
    of Whitefish’s compensation at the date of trial, not at the date of breach.  </p>

    also argues this scenario is consistent with equity’s presumption that the
    proceeds of sale of Whitefish’s timber rights would have been invested in
    the most profitable way or put to their most advantageous use.  This presumption,
    however, does not come into play because we know what the Crown would have
    done with the fair value of these rights.  It would have invested ninety
    per cent in the trust account it maintained for the band and distributed
    the rest to the band members.  And that is all Whitefish asks for.  Thus,
    we need not address the issue that confronted the Federal Court of Appeal
    in <i>Ermineskin Indian Band and Nation v. Canada</i>, [2007] 3 F.C.R. 245.  There
    the band argued that the Crown had a duty to invest its money – oil and gas
    royalties – as a common law trustee would do, in income earning property.  The
    majority of the court rejected the band’s argument.  </p>
  <h2>(ii)      An award of equitable compensation that includes compound interest
    is not barred by the nature of the Crown’s breach or the Crown’s historic
    immunity from paying interest</h2>

    turn now to the Crown’s two submissions on why, even in equity, the court
    cannot award compound interest.  First, the Crown submits that compound interest
    is not available in equity because, as the trial judge found, it did not
    deliberately breach its fiduciary duty, convert Whitefish’s money for its
    own use, or profit from its breach.  Second, the Crown submits that compound
    interest cannot be awarded as an element of equitable compensation because
    of the Crown’s historic immunity from paying interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first issue, Whitefish challenges the findings of the trial judge and
    asks us to substitute a finding that the Crown’s breach was “wilful, egregious
    and unconscionable”.  I see no basis to do so.  The trial judge’s findings
    are entitled to deference, and on the record before him, were reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless,
    I do not think that the trial judge’s findings assist the Crown in avoiding
    an award of compound interest as an element of equitable compensation.  Entitlement
    to equitable compensation does not require the Crown to have profited from
    its breach or to have intentionally conducted itself wrongfully.  Equity
    is engaged because the Crown had discretionary control over the sale of Whitefish’s
    property and over the sale proceeds, which it was required to invest for
    the band’s benefit.  See <i>Canson</i> at 573-574.  The nature of the Crown’s
    breach of duty does not afford a defence to an award of equitable compensation
    that includes compound interest, if compound interest is required to restore
    Whitefish to the position it would have been in the Crown had fulfilled its
    duty.</p>

    Crown’s second submission on why the court cannot award compound interest
    as an element of equitable compensation rests on its historic immunity from
    paying interest.  At common law, absent a statutory or contractual requirement
    to do so, the Crown was not obligated to pay interest on money that it owed:
    see <i>The King v. Carroll</i>, [1948] S.C.R. 126.  In 1971, this common
    law principle was codified in s. 35 of the <i>Federal Court Act</i>, R.S.,
    c. 10 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In adjudicating
    on any claim against the Crown, the Court shall not allow interest on any
    sum of money that the Court considers to be due to the claimant, in the absence
    of any contract stipulating for payment of that interest or of a statute
    providing in such a case for the payment of interest by the Crown. </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1992, however, amendments to the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 eliminated the Crown’s immunity from paying interest.  Section
    31(1) of that act allows for prejudgment interest on money owed by the Crown
    in accordance with provincial legislation: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Except as otherwise
    provided in any other Act of Parliament and subject to subsection (2), the
    laws relating to prejudgment interest in proceedings between subject and
    subject that are in force in a province apply to any proceedings against
    the Crown in any court in respect of any cause of action arising in that
    province.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'> Section
    31(6) stipulates that the section allowing for prejudgment interest is not
    retroactive.  In his award for compensation, the trial judge relied on the
    Crown’s immunity from paying prejudgment interest before 1992.  For the period
    from 1992 to the date of trial, the trial judge awarded prejudgment interest
    under s. 128 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whitefish
    submits that this immunity does not prevent the court from awarding compound
    interest as an element of equitable compensation.  The Crown submits that
    Whitefish cannot avoid the Crown’s immunity by re-characterizing its claim
    as one for equitable compensation.  In effect, the Crown says that the court
    cannot do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly.  </p>

    agree with Whitefish’s submission and would hold that the Crown’s common
    law and statutory immunity from paying interest does not preclude the inclusion
    of compound interest as an element of an award of equitable compensation.  An
    award of equitable compensation that includes compound interest differs fundamentally
    from prejudgment interest on a damages award.  Although the case law on this
    issue is limited, my holding is supported in both this court and the Federal
    Court trial division.  Further, I disagree with the Crown’s argument that
    this holding is contrary to <i>Guerin</i> and this court’s decision in <i>Gorecki
    v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Equitable
    compensation differs from prejudgment interest.  In equity, compensation
    is assessed, not calculated, and it is assessed at the date of trial, not
    the date of injury or breach.  In an appropriate case, compound interest
    may form part of that assessment.  The assessment does not necessarily involve
    a mathematical calculation.  But to give effect to equity’s objective of
    putting the beneficiary in the position it would have been in but for the
    fiduciary’s breach of duty, equity’s assessment may take compound interest
    into account.  For example, in this case an award that takes compound interest
    in account may be needed to fairly compensate Whitefish for its lost opportunity
    caused by the Crown’s improvident sale of the band’s timber rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    contrast, prejudgment interest – under, for example, the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i> –
    is a straight, linear calculation.  It is added to a successful party’s claim,
    virtually as of right, at a rate specified in advance and calculated from
    the date of injury or breach to the date of judgment.  Prejudgment interest
    does not form part of the court’s assessment of an appropriate damages award.  In
    short, a claim for compound interest as an element of equitable compensation
    is not a claim for prejudgment interest, and therefore is not barred by the
    Crown’s pre-1992 immunity.</p>

    element of equitable compensation and prejudgment interest on a damages award.  There,
    at 102, the court held that the provisions of the <i>Judicature Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1980, c. 223 (the predecessor to the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>),
    which gave a right to prejudgment interest but excluded compound interest,

    42 F.T.R. 241, Dubé J. held that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty by
    failing to lease surrendered reserve land at market rents.  In awarding the
    band compensation for the Crown’s breach, the trial judge accepted the estimate
    of one of the band’s experts, at para. 264, which “assumed that the difference
    between the market rent (net of deductions) and the rent received under the
    lease could have been invested and have accumulated compound interest.”  In
    the trial judge’s view (at para. 268) this estimate “reflects much more accurately
    the rentals that the plaintiff lost”
    and was a “fair and realistic appraisal.”</p>

      S.C.R. 245, Teitelbaum J. held that the band’s claim for equitable compensation
      because of the Crown’s alleged breach of fiduciary duty was barred by the
      relevant limitation statute or by laches and acquiescence and, even if
      it was not, the Crown had satisfied its duty to the bands.  Nonetheless,
      he addressed the question of compensation to provide for the possibility
      that the band had established a breach of fiduciary duty.  In so doing,
      Teitelbaum J. approved Dubé J.’s approach in <i>Lower Kootenay</i>.  In
      fixing compensation he said at para. 645: “I would like to make it clear
      that I am including compound interest in the valuations to reflect the
      investment return component of the amounts in issue.  It is not considered

    had awarded.  He refused to allow prejudgment interest, holding that s. 35
    of the <i>Federal Court Act</i> or the common law barred the claim.  The

    the trial judge’s ruling in <i>Guerin</i> does not assist the Crown.  Collier
    J. had already awarded the band equitable compensation assessed at the date
    of trial.  To award prejudgment interest on that amount would have violated
    s. 35 of the <i>Federal Court Act</i>, and as important, would have amounted
    to overcompensation.  Indeed, if anything, the court’s ruling in <i>Guerin</i> affirms

    an award of equitable compensation assessed at the date of trial.  Unlike

    provide for the payment of interest.  In my view, <i>Gorecki</i> does not
    assist the Crown in the present case for three reasons.  First, the panel
    in <i>Gorecki</i> recognized at para. 15 that an entitlement to interest
    could be based on an equitable principle; it ultimately held, however, that
    it was “plain and obvious” the Crown was not a fiduciary because the relationship

    here, unlike in <i>Gorecki</i>, the Crown was obliged to invest Whitefish’s
    money (by the terms of the Treaty, <i>Indian</i> <i>Act</i>, and surrender).  And
    third, unlike in this case, the legislation that precluded Gorecki’s claim

    been deposited in the trust account and remained there earning compound interest
    until 2005.  In his view, at para. 29, “on the principle of ‘first in, first
    out’”, the money “would likely have dissipated within a reasonable time”.  The
    Crown made the same point in this court.  It contended that Whitefish’s claim

    disagree.  The trial judge’s holding, echoed by the Crown, is unsupportable
    because it is contrary to one of equity’s presumptions, is entirely speculative,
    and is inconsistent with the terms of the surrender.  In the absence of evidence
    to the contrary – and there is virtually none – equity presumes that the
    defaulting fiduciary must account to the beneficiary on a basis most favourable
    to the beneficiary.  The trial judge’s finding presumes exactly the opposite – that

    this does not mean that Whitefish is entitled to 120 years of accumulated
    capital and interest.  That too is unsupportable.  Instead, I would adopt
    the approach used by Collier J. in <i>Guerin</i>, which was later approved

    we have an unsatisfactory record on which to make an informed judgment about
    Whitefish’s annual expenditures, either out of its revenue account or its
    capital account.  This unsatisfactory evidentiary record is a principal reason
    why a new hearing is needed to determine a fair and proportionate award of
    equitable compensation.  For example, we have very little evidence about
    Whitefish’s annual spending habits – how much capital it spent, how much
    interest it spent, and what it used the money for.  We have no expert evidence
    on the effect of expenditures on Whitefish’s claim.  The Crown, which presumably
    had annual records of Whitefish’s capital and revenue accounts, chose to
    file in evidence only the records for four fiscal years ending June 30 in
    1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890.  No records were filed for the years 1891 to

    lack of a proper record means that the parties’ factual arguments on the
    trial judge’s findings of dissipation are grounded not on an evidentiary
    basis but on speculative assumptions.  For example, the Crown asks us to
    assume that Whitefish would have immediately spent the interest on an investment
    of $31,600.  The records for 1887 to 1890 do show that each year Whitefish
    spent most or all of the money in its interest account.  But the amounts
    in the account were small.  $31,600 (or, ninety per cent of $31,600) would
    obviously have generated a significantly larger amount of interest.  Rather
    than assuming that all of this interest would be spent, it is just as plausible
    to assume that Whitefish’s annual need for money for expenses remained modest,
    and therefore some of the interest remained in the account to be reinvested.</p>

    Crown also asks us to assume that Whitefish would have “consumed” the $31,600
    it should have received, which I take to mean that it would have spent the
    money on items of ordinary daily use that had no income-earning potential
    or gave no long-term benefits to the band and its members.  Yet, it is just
    as plausible to assume that Whitefish would have used some of the money to
    purchase farm equipment, build roads or bridges on the reserve, or construct
    houses and schools.  These expenditures for capital assets may require using
    compound interest as a proxy to fairly value Whitefish’s equitable compensation.  Lord
    Denning made this point in a commercial context in <i>Wallersteiner</i> <i>v.

    of the money – years later – is by no means adequate compensation, especially

    band members but also for their descendants.  The surrender took a long term
    view of the investment.  It contemplated that at least some of the accumulated
    money would remain in the trust account to benefit future generations of
    band members.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    expert reports, too, do not assist the Crown’s position.  All of the expert
    reports, including the two reports tendered by the Crown, assumed that the
    fair value of Whitefish’s timber rights would be deposited in the trust account
    and stay there.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude this section of the reasons with three observations.  First, I consider
    the trial judge’s finding and the Crown’s position on “dissipation” unsupported
    by the evidence and contrary to both the principles of equitable compensation
    and the terms of the surrender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    however, in fixing Whitefish’s award of equitable compensation, I think it
    quite appropriate to take into account that over the years the band would
    have spent at least some of the interest earned on its capital investment
    of $28,440,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a> and perhaps even some of the capital itself.  This
    is one of the realistic contingencies that must be accounted for if the award
    is to be “fair and proportionate”, as Whitefish concedes it must be.  The
    amount urged on us by Whitefish – approximately $23 million – will inevitably
    have to be discounted to reflect these contingencies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again, <i>Guerin</i> is
    instructive.  There, the trial judge held that the most profitable use of
    the band’s surrendered land was as a residential subdivision.  But in determining
    the appropriate award of equitable compensation, the trial judge did not
    assume that the subdivision would have been developed in the most profitable
    way possible.  Instead, he discounted the award to reflect realistic contingencies
    that the subdivision would have faced.  For example, at paras. 127-128, he
    took into consideration the likely contingency that the residential subdivision
    would take about ten years longer to become “well on the road to full development” than
    the valuation experts assumed in their calculations.  Although he did not
    quantify these contingencies, he took them into account globally in assessing
    the band’s compensation.  The Supreme Court of Canada approved his approach.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the lack of a proper evidentiary record to evaluate the realistic contingencies
    that would affect Whitefish’s award of equitable compensation prevents this
    court from doing what the trial judge in <i>Guerin</i> was able to do.  Although
    the parties have asked us to fix Whitefish’s compensation, fairness to both
    sides requires that this be done at a new hearing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    I will do no more than list some of the evidence that might be useful and
    some of the considerations that might be taken into account in fixing a “fair
    and proportionate” award at the new hearing.</p>
  <h2>f)         Some considerations relevant to a “fair and proportionate” award </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    considerations I have in mind fall into two categories: deficiencies in the
    factual record and expert evidence.  I set out these considerations without
    in anyway attempting to bind the trial judge at the new hearing.</p>
  <h2>(i)        Deficiencies in the factual record  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    two main deficiencies in the factual record before us concern Whitefish’s
    annual spending patterns and the federal government’s practice of paying
    interest on band trust accounts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    Whitefish is to be restored to the position it likely would have been in
    but for the Crown’s breach, then the question whether Whitefish would have
    spent the money it ought to have received and the question how it would have
    spent that money need to be addressed – not by speculation but on a proper
    evidentiary record.  Four years of account records is an unsatisfactory base
    on which to make a fair assessment of what likely would have happened over
    a 120 year period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    is needed is evidence either from the Whitefish trust account records or
    elsewhere showing Whitefish’s annual spending patterns over the period.  For
    example, annually, how much of the interest in the interest account did it
    spend and on what?  Annually, how much interest remained in the interest
    account and was it reinvested?  Annually, was interest paid on the interest
    account, and if not, why not?  Annually, how much money did Whitefish spend
    out of the capital account and on what?  It seems to me that the answers
    to these, and no doubt other related questions, will assist in fixing an
    appropriate award of equitable compensation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also,
    the Crown should clarify whether money in band trust accounts earned simple
    interest or compound interest over the period 1886 to 1969, and whether interest
    was calculated annually or semi-annually.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Expert evidence </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    sides relied on expert valuation evidence to quantify Whitefish’s appropriate
    compensation.  Whitefish tendered the report of the financial advisory group
    at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, prepared by David Cornfield.  As Cornfield
    was not available for the trial, his colleague, Iseo Pasquali, testified
    for Whitefish.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown tendered two expert reports: the report of the well-known actuarial
    firm, Eckler Partners Ltd., prepared by Paul Della Penna, and the report
    of AJH Consulting, prepared by two economics professors, Arthur Hosios and
    Lawrence Smith.  Both Della Penna and Hosios testified for the Crown.  I
    will briefly summarize the expert evidence and my concerns with it.  I will
    refer to the three reports by the names of the three expert witnesses: Pasquali,
    Della Penna, and Hosios.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each
    expert took a range of base figures for the fair value of Whitefish’s timber
    rights in 1886.  Each expert assumed that neither the initial investment
    in the trust account in 1886 nor the accrued interest would be spent to the
    date of trial.  And each expert assumed that the Crown would not charge management
    fees for administering the trust account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pasquali
    calculated total simple interest and total compound interest on these base
    figures from October 1, 1886 to the date of trial.  He used the rates of
    interest in the Manual, which were prescribed by successive Orders-in-Council.  His
    valuations for initial investments of $31,600 and $25,000, each earning compound
    interest, were $23,480,380 and $18,576,250.  Neither Pasquali nor the two
    Crown experts calculated interest on a base figure of ninety per cent of
    $31,600 ($28,440), which is what the surrender called for.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Della
    Penna did three separate sets of calculations.  First, using consumer price
    index data from Statistics Canada, he calculated amounts reflecting the change
    in purchasing power of $1 from June 30, 1887 to February 1, 1992<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> with the addition of simple interest at five per
    cent from February 1, 1992 to the date of trial; and he calculated amounts
    reflecting the change in purchasing power of $1 from June 30, 1887 to the
    date of trial.  For a base figure of $31,600 his calculations produced valuations
    of $1,095,888 and $844,036.  The trial judge accepted this approach and awarded
    Whitefish Della Penna’s figure of $1,095,888.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Della Penna calculated total simple interest at annual interest rates of
    three, four, five, and six per cent.  Third, he did the same calculations
    at the same rates, but this time using compound interest.  Della Penna’s
    calculations show the price sensitivity of even small changes in the figures.  For
    an initial investment of $31,600 simple interest rates of three, four, five,
    and six per cent annually generated $143,780, $181,384, $218,672, and $256,276
    at the date of trial.  Compound interest at the same rates generated $1,046,592,
    $3,286,400, $10,205,852, and $31,356,048.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hosios’
    calculations were based on a hypothetical portfolio consisting of long-term
      government securities invested using a “laddering investment strategy”.  Under
      this strategy, equal portions of the base figure are invested in government
      bonds with different maturity terms up to a maximum of fifteen years.  Using
      a base figure of $31,600 this strategy generated a trial date valuation
      of $13,243,876.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    the three experts, only Pasquali used the interest rates prescribed by Order-in-Council.  I
    think that he was right to do so because these are the rates that would have
    been applied to any money in Whitefish’s account that came from the sale
    of its timber rights.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his evidence at trial, Hosios suggested that interest rates set out in the
    Manual and paid by the Crown exceeded the market rates on government bonds.  Therefore,
    in his view, the Crown was subsidizing Whitefish.  Hosios speculated that
    if the prescribed rates were applied to $31,600 and compounded, the resulting
    amount would have been so large the Crown would have eliminated the subsidy.  No
    evidence was led to support this speculation.  On this record, therefore,
    I discount it entirely.  The interest rates in the Manual were prescribed
    by Order-in-Council and applied not just to the money in the Whitefish account
    but to the money in every other band account.  Therefore, I think that Pasquali
    was correct in using these interest rates.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Pasquali’s calculations, like those of Della Penna and Hosios, suffer from
    the same problem: they are based on the unrealistic assumption that the initial
    capital investment, and the interest earned on that capital investment, would
    have remained untouched in the Whitefish trust account for 120 years.  In
    saying this, I intend no criticism of the experts.  Undoubtedly, they were
    asked to do these calculations using a set of assumptions given to them by
    their respective clients.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    that the parties produce better evidence of Whitefish’s annual spending patterns
    and of the government’s practice of paying interest on band trust accounts,
    the experts can appropriately revise their calculations to take account of
    the realistic contingencies affecting a fair award of equitable compensation
    for Whitefish.</p>
  <h2>D.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two issues on this appeal: first, did the trial judge err in his determination
    of the fair value of Whitefish’s timber rights in 1886; second, did the trial
    judge err in his assessment of Whitefish’s compensation, and if so, what
    is a “fair and proportionate” assessment?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first issue, Whitefish appealed and the Crown cross-appealed from the
    trial judge’s finding that the fair value of Whitefish’s timber rights in
    1886 was $31,600.  In my view, the trial judge’s finding is reasonable and
    is not tainted by any error in principle.  Therefore, I would not give effect
    to the appeal or to the cross-appeal on this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the second issue, Whitefish appealed the trial judge’s finding that it was
    entitled to compensation in the amount of $1,095,888.  I would allow the
    appeal on this issue.  In my view, the trial judge erred in principle by
    failing to award Whitefish equitable compensation for its lost investment
    opportunity caused by the Crown’s breach of fiduciary duty.  Whitefish is
    entitled to compensation measured by the amount the fair value of its timber
    rights would have earned in the Whitefish trust account maintained by the
    government for its benefit, but discounted to reflect realistic contingencies.  Because
    the deficiencies in the record prevent this court from assessing Whitefish’s
    compensation, I would order a new hearing on this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties have settled the costs of the appeal and I therefore make no order
    for costs.</p>
