    parties, who were formerly married, separated in 1999. In 2002, Lax J. issued
    a support order incorporating the terms of a separation agreement requiring
    the appellant husband, Abraham Kucyi, to pay $6000 a month in spousal support
    and $3,500 a month in child support plus tuition fees and other costs. While
    the separation agreement did not say what the income of the husband was at
    the time, it matched the table amount for child support for a payor with
    a total annual income of $317,000. The arbitrator found as a fact that the
    husband’s income was at least $350,000 at the time the separation agreement
    was signed.</p>

    August, 2004, the husband sought to vary the order based on a change in his
    circumstances. The parties agreed to have the variation issue dealt with
    by mediation and, if that failed, by arbitration. They did not settle at
    the mediation and so they agreed on arbitration dates fixed for January 18-19,
    2005. In the meantime, beginning in August, 2004 arrears of support began
    to accumulate as the husband ceased payment of any child or spousal support
    with the exception of a payment of $10,000. This was confirmed in oral argument
    before us. </p>

    event occasioning the husband’s change of circumstances was the suspension
    of his pharmacist’s licence in June, 2004, for six months. As a result, he
    sold his pharmacy business for a price of $550,000 for good will and about
    $150,000 for inventory. He retained ownership of the building, and received
    rental income from the pharmacy as well as from the four apartments above
    it for a net income of about $40,000 a year. At the end of his suspension
    in December, 2004, the husband began working 20 hours a week for another
    pharmacist at the rate of $42.50 an hour and was looking for full-time work.</p>

    December, 2004, the wife fired her lawyer and retained new counsel.  Her
    new lawyer orally requested an adjournment of the January arbitration dates,
    and subsequently brought a formal motion for an adjournment.  However, when
    the arbitrator made an interim order that the wife take steps to suspend
    enforcement of the $47,500 in support arrears, he withdrew his request.  Cross-examination
    of the husband on his October 2004 financial statement was fixed on consent
    for December 29, 2004. <span lang=EN-US>During that cross-examination of

      the morning of January 18, 2005, the day of the hearing. The updated financial
      statement showed a dramatic decrease in the husband’s net worth by over
      $1 million to about $1.459 million. In addition, his monthly net income
      and expenses in the January financial statement were both significantly
      higher although the difference in net result was less than $500 a month. </span></p>

      income had been reduced by 58.5% to $145,000 a year from $350,000.  That
      finding was based on the combined total of three figures: 1) the rental
      income of $40,000; 2) employment income of $80,000 including attribution
      for full-time employment; and 3) attribution of $25,000 of income on invested
      capital of $612,000.  As a result, the arbitrator ordered that effective
      August, 2004, when the husband initiated the variation application, the
      husband should pay Guideline child support for two children amounting to
      $1709 a month, in addition to the private and secondary school fees the

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      reasons of the Reviewing Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      reviewing judge preferred the evidence of the wife’s former counsel to
      that of the husband’s.  The four reasons she gave for doing so are reproduced
      in full below:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[5] First, the applicant [counsel for the wife]’s evidence is more
      probable.  He was seeking an adjournment from the moment of his retainer.  The
      new material filed was substantial.  It had not been discovered on.  It
      is inconceivable, given the history of prior requests for adjournment that
      he would not have sought an adjournment when faced with this new material.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[6] Second, the alleged denial of an adjournment was raised by the
      applicant in a timely way.  The applicant filed an affidavit dated February
      24, 2005 in which this complaint was clearly advanced. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[7] The respondent [counsel for the husband] filed an affidavit in
      the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dated the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of November, 2005.  He did
    not challenge the applicant’s earlier evidence with respect to the requested
    adjournment.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[8] Third, regrettably, I did not find the respondent’s solicitor’s
      evidence on the issue of the requested adjournment credible, in the sense,
      that he attempted to downplay the complexity of the material filed by him
      at the outset of the arbitration, yet was unable to explain the $1 million
      difference in the financial statements.  I believe that his evidence on
      the adjournment was mistaken.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[9] Finally, it is agreed that the arbitrator granted a short recess.
      I do not believe that [counsel for the wife] asked for a short recess.  I
      conclude that [counsel for the wife] sought an adjournment.  It was refused.  He
      was allowed a short recess. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      adverting to the need for caution in relation to the arbitrator’s exercise
      of discretion on the issue of an adjournment, she nevertheless concluded
      that an adjournment should have been granted.  As a result of the arbitrator’s
      refusal to grant an adjournment, she held that
    “[t]he applicant [wife] was not treated fairly and was not given an opportunity
    to respond to the respondent [husband]’s case.” Further, “[n]o acceptable
    excuse was provided for the last minute filing.  If the late evidence was
    to be received an adjournment was mandatory once requested.” Accordingly,
    the reviewing judge set aside the arbitrator’s award.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      an addendum to her reasons, the reviewing judge also set aside the interim
      arbitration award which had ordered the wife to take steps to stay enforcement
      of the arrears of support totaling $47,500. The reviewing judge did so
      on the basis that no motion was brought for this relief prior to the hearing
      of the motion for the adjournment and, while such an order could have been
      made as a term of the adjournment, the adjournment had been refused.  In
      addition the arbitrator gave no reasons for ordering the wife to stay enforcement
      of the entire amount of arrears as opposed to a reduction in the amount
      to be paid pending the outcome of the arbitration. In doing so, she again
      relied on s. 46(1)6 of the <i>Arbitration Act. </i></span></p>

    1)  The judge misapprehended the evidence in finding that counsel for the
    respondent wife requested an adjournment.  There was no request for an adjournment.
    2)  Even if there was a request for an adjournment, there was nothing unfair
    about the arbitrator’s denial of an adjournment. <span lang=EN-US>The husband’s
    sworn January 17, 2005 financial statement, produced for the hearing, did
    not differ materially from the earlier October 17, 2005 financial statement
    and it was within the discretion of the arbitrator to refuse the adjournment.
    3) The wife has not shown that, if the adjournment had been granted, it would
    have made a difference to the award. 4) The reviewing judge ought not to
    have set aside the arbitrator’s interim award. </span></p>

    19, 2005.  In support of this submission, counsel for the husband relied
    on the affidavit of the wife which refers to a request for an adjournment
    on January 19 as well as to a portion of the proceedings before the reviewing
    judge, specifically the cross-examination of the lawyer who was counsel for
    the wife at the arbitration hearing. In reply we were directed to the re-examination
    in which the wife’s counsel clarified that an adjournment had been requested
    on both January 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>.  </p>

lang=EN-US>ounsel on an appeal rightly invite the court to carefully examine
      isolated parts of the evidence, it is the judge at first instance who saw
      and heard the whole of the narrative who is in the best position to make
      an assessment of whether an adjournment was sought. To paraphrase this
      court’s decision in <i>Waxman v. Waxman,</i> [2004] O.J. No. 1765 at paras.
      291-92, strong deference to the factual findings of the trial judge best
      strikes the balance between the goal of achieving individual justice and
      the need to preserve the overall effective administration of justice. Merely
      because an appellate court might view the evidence differently from the
      trial judge and make different factual findings is not a basis for concluding
      that the appellate court’s findings will be more accurate and its result
      more consistent with the justice of the particular case than the result
      achieved at trial. Thus, appellate courts must defer to all findings of
      fact drawn by the judge at first instance unless the court is satisfied
      that the finding was the product of a “palpable and </span>overriding”
    error. That deference equally applies to inferences from the evidence:  See <i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>H.L. v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</span></i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.</p>

      trial judge’s conclusion that the denial of an adjournment was unfair was
      based in part on the inability of the husband’s counsel to explain the
      $1 million difference between the financial statement provided earlier
      and the one provided at the arbitration. On this appeal, a footnote in
      the appellant’s factum states as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>There was not a $1 million difference as Justice Backhouse states.  When
      the financial statements are compared it is clear that there was an arithmetic
      error between the two statements and not an error of any substance.  The
      Learned Judge erred in finding that there was a substantial difference
      in the statements and should have accepted that when the constituent elements
      of the statements were compared there was not significant difference. Moreover,
      any differences would have been the subject of cross-examination before
      the Arbitrator.</span></p>

      us, the appellant explained that there was a $500,000 computer error in
      the January 17, 2005 financial statement and the balance of the difference
      related to disposition costs (including taxes) with respect to property
      previously disposed of, and an increase in debt having to do with transfers
      between the appellant’s personal account and his companies. </span></p>

      as the $500,000 computer error was not disclosed to the reviewing judge
      when counsel for the husband gave his evidence, I would infer that the
      existence of that error was also not apparent during the husband’s cross-examination
      before the arbitrator. On the contrary, the financial statements provided
      quite different values for the husband’s accounts, business interests and
      debts. The reason for the differences between the statements was not readily
      apparent and it was not obvious that $500,000 of the $1 million difference
      was merely due to a mathematical error. The interrelationship between the
      husband’s personal account and his companies required even the husband’s
      counsel to study the supplementary disclosure brief carefully and took
      him some time to work out. </span></p>

    amount of capital that the husband had available on which to earn income
    was one of the figures the arbitrator used to attribute income to the husband
    and on which he based his award. The presence of the discrepancy may have
    made it difficult or impossible for the wife’s counsel to properly understand
    and challenge the husband’s representations as to his capital. <span lang=EN-US>As
    a result, we are not prepared to interfere with the reviewing judge’s conclusion
    that, in the particular circumstances, the denial of the adjournment was
    unfair.  </span></p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on the decision in <i>National Ballet of Canada v. Glasco </i>(2000),
    49 O.R. (3d) 230, a case in which an adjournment was also refused.  That
    case held that the refusal of the adjournment did not prevent the applicant
    from filing his own affidavit material to contradict that of the respondent.  Here,
    this was not the case. More importantly, we cannot say, as the court held
    in <i>National Ballet, </i>that findings of credibility were unnecessary
    in order to come to a decision.</p>

    could readily obtain the information it was seeking for itself or had an
    opportunity to meet and counter the information tendered. While the differences
    between the financial statements may now appear to us to be readily apparent
    with the benefit of hindsight and counsel’s explanation, that does not appear
    to have been the situation before the reviewing judge.  In addition, owing
    to the timing when the information was presented, the wife’s counsel had
    no opportunity to counter that information. </p>
