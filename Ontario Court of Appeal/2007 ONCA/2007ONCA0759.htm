    1978 the appellant, Ms. Lanty, bought a cottage in
    <st1:place

    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Wasaga

    Beach
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Provincial
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park.  To reach her cottage she drove over 150 feet of beach property.  In
    1998, however, the respondent, the Minister of Natural Resources, terminated
    her vehicular access to her cottage by changing the lock on the gate leading
    to the beach.  The Ministry said that it did so because of concerns about
    safety and the public interest.  The Ministry offered Ms. Lanty the continued
    use of two parking spaces it had provided four hundred feet from her cottage
    and the right to drive over the beach to her cottage for emergencies or on
    other justifiable occasions.  Ms. Lanty was not content with this offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lanty brought this action seeking a declaration that she had a legally enforceable
    right to drive over the beach to her cottage, and an award of damages.  The
    Ministry defended by asserting that she had no legal right to drive to her
    cottage; her ability to do so in the past had been by permission, which the
    Ministry was entitled to and justifiably did terminate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Ms. Lanty’s claim turned on who owns the beach property, whether it
    had been a “highway”, a “roadway”, or an “access road”, and whether Ms. Lanty
    had established a prescriptive or equitable easement or an easement of necessity.  In
    a thorough and well reasoned decision, DiTomaso J. dismissed Ms. Lanty’s
    action and awarded costs against her in the amount of $133,800.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal Ms. Lanty renews the arguments that she made at trial save for one.  She
    abandons her claim under the <i>Road</i> <i>Access</i> <i>Act</i>.  She also
    seeks leave to appeal the trial judge’s costs order against her.  On the
    issues she argues in this court we agree substantially with the reasons of
    the trial judge.  We add only the following brief comments.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>1)        Ownership of the beach property </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    original Crown patent in 1866 granted the land to a Mr. George Cook, subject
    to the following clause: “Reserving the beach and free access to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    shore of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lake Huron for all vessels, boats, and persons.”  The trial judge concluded
    that by this “reservation” clause, the provincial Crown retained legal title
    to the beach property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lanty submits that in so concluding the trial judge misapplied the majority
    judgment of this court in <i>Gibbs v. Grand Bend (Village) </i>(1995), 26
    O.R. (3d) 644.  In that case, Finlayson J.A. for the majority drew a distinction
    between a “reservation” clause and an “exception”
    clause.  If the Crown patent uses the word “reserving” the fee is ordinarily
    transferred to the grantee.  If the patent uses the word “excepting” the
    Crown ordinarily retained the fee.  Ms. Lanty contends that because the patent
    to Cook used the word “reserving”, after 1866 the Crown no longer owned the
    beach property.  Instead it vested in the municipality until it was reclaimed
    by the Crown on the establishment of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Provincial
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park in 1974.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully considered this court’s judgment in <i>Gibbs</i> and
    distinguished the wording of the Crown patent in that case from the wording
    of the patent in this case.  He held that though the clause uses the word “reserving”,
    its specific language showed that the Crown retained title.  We think it
    was open to the trial judge to so hold.  In <i>Gibbs</i> itself, though Finlayson
    J.A. distinguished between Crown patents using the word “reserving” and those
    using the word “excepting”, he also made the important point that whether
    the Crown did or did not retain title depended on the wording and context
    of the entire clause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if the trial judge erred in holding that the Crown retained title to
    the beach property under the 1866 patent, this “error”
    does not advance Ms. Lanty’s position.  The trial judge held, in the alternative,
    that the Crown acquired title to the property by the 1924 Watson dedication
    of the “sand beach … to public use”.  That holding is amply supported in
    the record as outlined at para. 49 of the trial judge’s reasons.  We are
    not persuaded of any basis to set aside that holding.  Thus, from 1866 on,
    or at the latest, from 1924 on, the provincial Crown owned the beach property.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>2)        Highway or roadway? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    many years, the public drove their cars along the beach and parked their
    cars on the beach.  Indeed, the public often described the beach as a road
    or a highway.  Nonetheless, these two facts do not turn the
    “beach road” into a legal highway or roadway triggering closing obligations
    under the <i>Municipal</i> <i>Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25.  The trial
    judge found that Ms. Lanty had failed to prove the beach road was a road
    or a highway under the act or at common law.  That finding is supported by
    the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as the trial judge also observed, once the Crown established ownership of
    the beach property, s. 63 of the <i>Public</i> <i><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>Lands</span></i> <i>Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.43 applied, and this section by itself answers Ms. Lanty’s
    claim.  Section 63 states: “Any part of the public lands that is a beach
    and is used for travel by the public is not by reason only of such use a
    highway within the meaning of any Act”.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>3)        Easements </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave several reasons why Ms. Lanty had not established an easement
    to drive her car over the beach to her cottage.  On appeal, she argues two
    main points: the scope of the Crown’s permission and the July 13, 1978 letter
    from the park superintendent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rightly held that permission – “neighbourly accommodation” – cannot
    be turned into an enforceable legal right.  Ms. Lanty tries to avoid this
    sensible proposition by arguing that she drove on the beach in a way inconsistent
    with the Ministry’s permission.  She relies on this court’s judgment in <i>Rose</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Krieser</i> <i>(In
    Trust)</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 641.  That case is entirely distinguishable
    on its facts.  And the short answer to Ms. Lanty’s submission on this issue
    is that on cross-examination she acknowledged she drove along the beach to
    her cottage with the Ministry’s permission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    park superintendent’s letter was not an ideal response to Ms. Lanty’s letter
    requesting clarification of her rights.  However, the response does not contain
    any representation on which Ms. Lanty could reasonably rely to impose a legal
    obligation on the Ministry to provide her car access to her cottage.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>4)        Costs </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    think that the trial judge was correct to award costs against Ms. Lanty.  This
    was not one of those rare novel or public interest cases warranting a no
    costs order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the only real question on this branch of the appeal is the quantum.  The
    amount is admittedly high.  Yet, the trial judge gave detailed reasons for
    his order, which included Ms. Lanty’s “unreasonable and uncooperative behaviour”,
    both before and during the trial – behaviour, the trial judge found, that
    increased the length of the proceedings.  Bearing in mind the narrow scope
    of appellate review of a trial judge’s costs award, we can find no basis
    to interfere with the award in this case.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>5)        Conclusion </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Substantially
    for the reasons given by the trial judge and for these brief additional reasons,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs in the agreed amount of $10,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
