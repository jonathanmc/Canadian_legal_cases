  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal by the Ministry of Labour from the judgment of Zuraw J. of the
    Ontario Court of Justice upholding the acquittal of Dofasco Inc. (“the employer”)
    by Justice of the Peace Welsh of the Ontario Court of Justice, Provincial
    Offences Court on three charges under s. 25 of the <i>Occupational Health
    and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (“OHSA”). The charges against the
    employer arose when an employee suffered a serious hand injury while working
    on a cold-rolling steel mill. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal relates to count one on the information. The particulars of that charge
    provide:</p>
  <p><u>Particulars:</u> The defendant failed to ensure that the pinch point
    between the upper and lower rollers on the pinch and drive rolls, on the
    #1-66” Cold Rolling Mill was equipped with a guard as required. A worker,
    Robert McCormick, was injured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    employer was alleged to have failed to equip the mill with a guard in violation
    of s. 25 of the <i>Industrial Establishments Regulations</i>, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 851 (“the Regulation”), enacted under the OHSA.  Section 25 of the Regulation
    provides:</p>
  <p>An in-running nip hazard or any part of a machine, device or thing that
    may endanger the safety of any worker shall be equipped with and guarded
    by a guard or other device that prevents access to the pinch point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Justice of the Peace concluded that Dofasco’s workplace procedures and enhancements
    allowing “hands-free” loading into the mill dispensed with the requirement
    for a guard. He stated in his reasons:</p>
  <p>…it would appear that the prosecution has made a <i>prima facie</i> case
    regarding this count, and by definition and letter of the law, the fact that
    there is no guard at the pinch points, a conviction should be registered.
    The defendant, however, has presented evidence of procedures and enhancements
    to the No. 1 66-inch Cold Rolling Mill known as the hands-free loading unit.  Further
    evidence has been provided that when a difficulty arises with a coil of steel
    there are procedures employed known as the push bar and hand-grippers to
    assist in feeding the free or lead end of the coil into the mill.  The procedures
    of the push bar and use of hand-grippers to assist in the feeding of the
    coil into the mill put the employee, at the very least, at arm’s length from
    any pinch points, and therefore, looking at the intent of the law, would
    preclude the need for a guard on a pinch point as it would be, as it would
    or should be a non-issue. As such, on this count the court finds that the
    prosecution has failed in proving beyond a reasonable doubt on count one,
    and count one is dismissed. An acquittal is entered.</p>
  <h3>Standard of review</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ministry of Labour contends that the employer cannot comply with the guarding
    requirement in s. 25 of the Regulation by developing procedures and enhancements
    with respect to the operation of a machine that has the potential to endanger
    the safety of a worker.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue in this appeal is the proper interpretation of s. 25 of the
    Regulation, a question of law.  In particular, can workplace procedures and
    enhancements substitute for a guard under s. 25 of the Regulation?  The standard
    of review on a question of law is correctness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Zuraw
    J. concluded that he was unable to find any
    “clear and palpable error in law or fact or mixed law and fact…” In applying
    the standard of review of “clear and palpable error”, he applied an incorrect
    standard. </p>
  <h3>The employer’s obligation under section 25(1) of the OHSA</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Justice of the Peace made a finding at trial, obviously in the context of
    the procedures put in place by Dofasco, that the accident which caused the
    injury to Robert McCormick, and “…the subsequent pain, and suffering and
    rehabilitation falls fully and completely on [him] and his actions and not
    on the employer…” The Ministry of Labour takes no issue with this finding,
    but states that whether the injured employee is at fault or not is irrelevant
    to the breach of s. 25 of the Regulation.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    25(1) of the OHSA provides that “An employer shall ensure that,… (c) the
    measures and procedures prescribed are carried out in the workplace…”  As
    such, the regulation imposes a “strict duty” on the employer. This has been
    held to be in the nature of the obligation of an insurer and to be non-delegable:
    see <i>R. v. Wyssen</i> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 193 at 198 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). However, it has been held by the Supreme Court of Canada that this duty
    falls short of “absolute liability”: see <i>R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie</i> (1978),
    40 C.C.C. (2d) 353 at 373 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the Justice of the Peace made a specific finding that Dofasco
    did not provide a guard. Dofasco does not contest that finding. Rather, Dofasco
    claims that it was not obliged to provide a guard because it complied with
    s. 25 of the Regulation through other means. In the alternative, Dofasco
    says it should be excused from liability based on the circumstances. </p>

  <h3>Issues raised on this appeal </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues raised on this appeal are as follows: </p>

  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3>(i) The principles of statutory interpretation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is trite law that the words of the Act must be read in their entire context
    and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme
    and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament: see <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> (Ministry of Labour) v. City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 37 at para. 16 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court said:</p>
  <p>The OHSA is a remedial public welfare statute intended to guarantee a minimum
    level of protection for the health and safety of workers. When interpreting
    legislation of this kind, it is important to bear in mind certain guiding
    principles. Protective legislation designed to promote public health and
    safety is to be generously interpreted in a manner that is in keeping with
    the purposes and objectives of the legislative scheme. Narrow or technical
    interpretations that would interfere with or frustrate the attainment of
    the legislature’s public welfare objectives are to be avoided. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bearing
    these principles in mind, in our view, the Justice of the Peace erred in
    his interpretation of s. 25 of the Regulation and there is no merit in the
    submissions advanced by Dofasco.</p>
  <h3>(ii)  s. 28 of the Regulation and the requirement for “an operating control
    that acts as a guard”</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on s. 28 of the Regulation, the respondent argued that s. 25 of the Regulation
    does not require a physical guard. Section 28 of the Regulation provides
    as follows:</p>
  <p>An operating control that acts as a guard for a machine not otherwise guarded
    shall, </p>
  <p>(a) be in a location where the safety of the operator is not endangered
    by moving machinery;</p>
  <p>(b) be arranged so that it cannot be operated accidentally; and </p>
  <p>(c) not be made ineffective by a tie-down device or other means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on the words “an operating control that acts as a guard”, Dofasco points
    to the second employee on the team, Mr. Kerr, who was stationed in the pulpit
    (the control booth for the mill that is located about 20 feet away from the
    steel coil) and whose job it was to raise and lower the pinch roll as the “operating
    control”. Dofasco contends that Mr. Kerr constituted the “operating control” in
    that he was in a position at all times to prevent any injury to his co-worker
    by operation of the machine controls. We reject this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear from the wording of s. 28 of the Regulation that an operating control
    means a <i>physical control</i> that protects the operator of the control.
    The subsections of s. 28 reinforce this in referring to the operating control
    location, that it be arranged so that it cannot be operated accidentally
    and cannot be made ineffective by tie-down devices or other means. These
    provisions must be read conjunctively. In our opinion, it is apparent that
    the drafters had in mind a <i>physical</i> “operating control” protecting
    the operator of the machine. <span lang=EN-US>In this case, the fact that
    the accident occurred with Mr. Kerr in the pulpit demonstrates the flaw in
    the theory underlying Dofasco’s argument.</span> In our view, s. 28 of the
    Regulation has no application to the present circumstances.</p>
  <h3>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s.
    25 of the Regulation and the use of a “push bar” </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dofasco’s
    second argument depends on an interpretation of the words “other device” in
    s. 25 of the Regulation.  Dofasco submits that the push bar, a 10-12 foot
    device to be used by the employee to start the steel rolling into the mill,
    constituted an “other device” which prevented access by the employee to the
    pinch point of the mill. Dofasco protocols and procedures required use of
    a push bar, which, when used by the employee, kept the employee a safe distance
    from the pinch point. We cannot accept this submission. In our view, to do
    so would require a strained interpretation of s. 25 of the Regulation and
    one that is contrary to the purpose of the statute when read as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn first to the language of the section. Section 25 of the Regulation specifically
    provides that “any part of a machine…that may endanger the safety of any
    worker” must be “equipped with” and “guarded by” the
    “other device”. In our opinion, when s. 25 is interpreted properly, it is
    clear that the push bar does not come within the definition of “other device”.  The
    push bar does not satisfy either of these requirements—it is not part of
    the equipment of the mill nor does it “guard”
    the mill. Further, the push bar could not, on its own, “preven[t] access
    to the pinch point”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the purpose of guarding under the Regulation is to prevent advertent and
    inadvertent conduct on the part of the employee from resulting in injury
    to the worker, and in particular, to take individual discretion, judgment
    and degree of concentration and capability out of the equation. The push
    bar leaves all of these parameters in play rather than ruling them out as
    a physical guard is intended to do, and therefore, fall outside the contemplation
    of s. 25 of the Regulation. </p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    deliberate conduct of the worker in not following company procedures</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dofasco’s
    third argument is that an employer cannot be held liable under s. 25 of the
    Regulation where an employee is injured as the result of his and a co-worker’s
    deliberate conduct in failing to follow company procedures and protocols.
    Dofasco emphasizes the statement by the injured worker to his co-worker to
    the effect that “to hell with it lets do it the way we used to” to place
    the blame for the accident squarely on the shoulders of the injured worker,
    Mr. McCormick. The Justice of the Peace adopted this view. We cannot accede
    to this position. It is contrary to the scheme of the OHSA and the Regulations.
    In our view, it is also at odds with the relevant jurisprudence and common
    sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of the Regulation, employee misconduct does not go to the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of the offence. Rather, at least in relation to employees carrying
    out their work, an employer is strictly liable if it fails to comply with
    its obligations and there is no suggestion that employee misconduct constitutes
    any form of defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    Collins J. had this to say about the purpose of the OHSA in <i>R. v. Spanway
    Buildings Limited</i>, April 3, 1986, unreported, at p. 4 (Ont. Prov. Ct.
    (Crim. Div.)):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…one of the purposes of
    the act is to protect workers in this very hazardous industry from their
    own negligence. No one in any occupation can work 100 percent of the time
    without occasional carelessness. However, the potential for serious consequences
    of momentary negligence is much greater in the construction industry than
    in almost any other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>This admonition is particularly
    apposite in the context of the steel industry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as was noted by Laskin J.A. in his decision granting leave to appeal in this
    case, “…workplace safety regulations are not designed just for the prudent
    worker.  They are intended to prevent workplace accidents that arise when
    workers make mistakes, are careless, or are even reckless.” In our view,
    this principle also extends to deliberate acts of employees while performing
    their work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion, Dofasco’s argument ignores common sense. Employees do not deliberately
    injure themselves. The requirement for guarding of machinery is to protect
    employees in the workplace from injuries due to both inadvertent and advertent
    acts. This is the reason for the requirement for physical guards. Employees
    encounter all variations of workplace hazards. Some are inadvertent – for
    example, employees may slip, misjudge distances, lose their balance, their
    timing or dexterity may be off, lose concentration or simply be careless.
    Physical guards or their equivalent are obviously required to prevent against
    injury in these situations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Physical
    guards or the equivalent are also required to prevent injury from advertent
    acts by employees exposing themselves to risk of injury.  In this regard
    there seems to be some confusion as to what meaning ought to be attributed
    to deliberate acts. This does not mean an act by an employee to intentionally
    injure oneself. That stretches credulity. It does mean, however, that on
    occasion an employee may make a conscious decision to disobey an instruction
    or work practice in order to get his or her work done. Indeed, that is what
    occurred in the present instance. The statement by Mr. McCormick makes this
    clear. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    the workers here did not disobey the work instruction to spite or injure
    the employer. They did so because the work practice specified did not readily
    accomplish its task with certain light gauges of steel stock such as they
    were processing on the day in question. The use of the push bar or hand grippers,
    which were specified, did not work properly on the light steel being processed
    through the rolling mill on this occasion. The employees could have pulled
    the roll of steel off of the mill. That was the specified procedure but it
    would have meant delays and curtailed production. Instead they chose to use
    a procedure they had used on a different machine, thereby exposing Mr. McCormick
    to the risk of injury on this machine. The injury he suffered was as a result
    of his deliberate act, but it was an act done in furtherance of productivity
    in the work undertaken for the employer and not for any other reason. To
    suggest that the responsibility for the injury, pain and suffering rests
    squarely on his shoulders would be unfair because defects in the process
    for performing the work in question and the absence of a physical guard contributed
    significantly to the accident. For all of the foregoing reasons, we do not
    give effect to this submission.</p>
  <h3>(v) The defence of due diligence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dofasco’s
    final argument is raised by way of defence. If we do not accept its other
    arguments, Dofasco asks that we send this matter back to the Justice of the
    Peace for a trial on the issue of due diligence. Relying on the decision
    of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>, Dofasco submits
    that it led evidence at trial making it clear that it has taken all reasonable
    steps to ensure that workers would not be endangered by the rollers and/or
    that it reasonably believed that the rollers did not present a hazard. Accordingly,
    it submits that the matter should be remitted to the trial court to determine
    this issue. We cannot accede to this submission. In our view, Dofasco did
    not lead evidence at trial which is capable of supporting a due diligence
    defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first branch of the test, based on our interpretation of
    s. 25 of the Regulation as outlined above, Dofasco did not lead evidence
    that it had taken any steps to place a guard or other device at the pinch
    point as required. In these circumstances, Dofasco cannot show that it took
    all reasonable steps to avoid the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the second branch of the test, Dofasco does not assert that it believed,
    mistakenly, that it had taken steps to place a guard or other device at the
    pinch point as required by the Regulation. Instead, it advances a strained
    interpretation of s. 25 of the Regulation to support a contention in law
    rather than fact that it complied with the Regulation. This does not meet
    the second branch of the test in that it is not a mistake of fact but rather
    a mistaken apprehension as to the requirements of the Regulation and the
    statutory regime.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal
    and enter a conviction. Given the concurrence, of counsel we remit the matter
    to the Justice of the Peace for sentencing. </p>
