line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues raised on this appeal revolve around the interplay between the appellant’s
    testimonial capacity, on the one hand, and his fitness for trial together
    with the fairness of that trial, on the other.  Specifically, the appellant
    argues that his inability to remember the events surrounding the death of
    his ex-girlfriend render him unfit to stand trial for her homicide and in
    any event, justify a stay of the proceedings against him on abuse of process
    grounds because his amnesia deprives him of his ability to make full answer
    and defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Morrissey could not cope with rejection.  Three weeks after he and his girlfriend,
    Melissa Pajkowski, had broken up, he forced his way into his father’s gun
    cabinet, took out a .22 calibre pistol and two boxes of ammunition, and drove
    to Ms. Pajkowski’s residence in his father’s Jeep.  There, he picked her
    up and proceeded to drive north on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Bathurst Street in the area of
    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    vehicle – moving at a high rate of speed – was spotted by a police officer
    conducting radar speed control.  He signalled the Jeep to stop.  When it
    failed to do so, he initiated pursuit with siren and cruiser lights activated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    later, Mr. Morrissey shot Ms. Pajkowski in the head, then turned the gun
    on himself and fired a single shot to the middle of his forehead.  Ms. Pajkowski
    died from the gunshot wound.  Mr. Morrissey did not.  He survived his suicide
    attempt, but suffered a very severe brain injury.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effects of that brain injury are central to this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Morrissey was charged with first degree murder.  At the outset of trial,
    the defence requested a hearing to determine the appellant’s fitness to stand
    trial.  The issue was tried by a jury but the trial judge, Fuerst J., refused
    to accept defence counsel’s request that she charge the jury to the effect
    that testimonial competence was a pre-condition to a finding of fitness to
    stand trial.  The jury found the appellant fit.  He then re-elected to be
    tried by Fuerst J. alone, without a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the close of the Crown’s case, defence counsel applied for a finding, pursuant
    to ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>, that the appellant’s right to make
    full answer and defence was fatally impaired (the “Incompetency Application”).  This
    impairment of the appellant’s right to make full answer and defence was said
    to flow from the fact that he was incompetent to testify, itself a consequence
    of his inability to remember the critical events.  The trial judge held that
    a ruling as to the appellant’s mental capacity to testify would require him
    to testify on a competency <i>voir dire</i>.  This, the appellant declined
    to do.  The Incompetency Application was therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury
    at the fitness hearing that an accused person’s testimonial competence is
    a pre-condition to his or her fitness to stand trial.  He further submits
    that the trial judge erred in requiring him to testify on a competency <i>voir
    dire</i> in relation to the Incompetency Application.  Finally, although
    he did not pursue this argument orally, the appellant alleged in his Notice
    of Appeal that he had been denied the right to make full answer and defence
    and, accordingly that the proceedings should have been stayed on abuse of
    process grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree, and, as I shall explain, would dismiss the appeal for the following
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Testimonial
    competence is not a condition precedent to fitness to stand trial.  Although
    they may have overlapping characteristics, the two concepts, and the nature
    of the inquiries concerning them, are quite different.  Moreover, amnesia,
    alone does not render an accused unfit to stand trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if, in a given case, testimonial incompetence through incapacity to recall
    could be a factor in a finding of unfitness, the evidence in this case provides
    no basis for a finding of testimonial incompetence or unfitness to stand
    trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not err in ruling that the appellant could not meet the burden
    on the Incompetency Application without testifying.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did she err in finding no violation of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> right
    to make full answer and defence.</p>

    and Ms. Pajkowski</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    full outline of the factual background is unnecessary, as the issues raised
    on the appeal revolve only around the appellant’s testimonial capacity.  However,
    some of the history is helpful in understanding the context in which this
    sad tragedy unfolded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant lived at home with his parents, Drs. John and Claire Morrissey.  He
    had experienced some difficulties as a young child, expressing thoughts of
    suicide, and as a teenager had spent some time in a drug treatment centre
    because of his use of marijuana.  Between 1995 and 1998 he had been prescribed
    Prozac as treatment for depression.  He struggled at school because of learning
    disabilities and, although he had completed Grade 12 some years before the
    homicide, he subsequently failed to complete a program at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName

    George
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Brown
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College.  He was not working at the time of the homicide.  As the trial judge
    noted,
    “[b]y April 1999, it seemed that [Mr. Morrissey’s] life was not moving ahead.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    had been other girlfriends in the past, but these relationships had not been
    successful.  The appellant attempted to commit suicide following the termination
    of one of them.  In the context of these relationships and their subsequent
    breakdowns, he appears to have been emotional, intense, frustrated, angry
    and, at times, sorrowful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and Ms. Pajkowski had been in a romantic relationship for about
    a year but that relationship had ended about three weeks before the homicide.  Ms.
    Pajkowski was living at home as well with her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Pajkowski.  She
    was working part-time at a local grocery store and attending night school
    to complete her high school education.  Although she had experienced difficulties
    in the past, she was focusing on moving forward and getting her life in order.  She
    was described as being independent, strong-willed and confident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relationship between Mr. Morrissey and Ms. Pajkowski was turbulent at times,
    as they argued and quarrelled frequently.  It was the appellant who finally
    ended it.  Nonetheless, he was distraught over the break-up and continued
    to contact Ms. Pajkowski thereafter.  They talked and met on several occasions.  Ms.
    Pajkowski insisted that the relationship was over and even considered obtaining
    a restraining order because of Mr. Morrissey’s possessive conduct.  She appears,
    however, to have been reluctant to hurt the appellant by rebuffing him altogether.  When
    she began dating other men, the appellant became upset and there is some
    evidence that he threatened violence towards her in the days leading up to
    her death.  A few nights before the homicide occurred the appellant was found
    lying prostrate on the Pajkowski’s front lawn; he had attempted to commit
    suicide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant was hospitalized following this event, he was subsequently
    released.  A few days later, the unfortunate homicide/attempted suicide that
    forms the basis for this appeal took place.  Mr. Morrissey was 26 years old
    at the time; Ms. Pajkowski was 21.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left;page-break-after:avoid'>The Appellant’s Mental Condition at the
    Time of Trial</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    both the fitness hearing and the Incompetency Application the appellant relied
    heavily on the testimony of Dr. John Salmon (a neuropsychologist) and Dr.
    Hy Bloom (a forensic psychiatrist), both of whom assessed Mr. Morrissey for
    purposes of the proceedings.  Their evidence is summarized by the trial judge
    in paragraphs 10-19 of her reasons on a broad stay application addressed
    at various stages of the proceeding (reported at (2003) 177 C.C.C. (3d) 428).  For
    the sake of convenience, and as a ready summary of their testimony, I recite
    that synopsis here:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>[10] … Mr. Fleming relies in particular
    on the testimony of Dr. John Salmon and Dr. Hy Bloom given on the fitness
    hearing, which on consent has become part of the evidence on the trial. For
    the purpose of this application, a brief summary of the relevant aspects
    of their testimony is sufficient.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[11] Dr. Salmon is a neuropsychologist who assessed Mr. Morrissey
    in 1999. He testified that Mr. Morrissey suffered a severe to very severe
    brain injury. He had been close to death. There were multiple bullet fragments
    in the left frontal lobe of the brain. There had been swelling of the brain,
    and bleeding. Mr. Morrissey had a craniotomy, and later had the bone flap
    replaced.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[12] In Dr. Salmon’s opinion, it is highly likely that Mr. Morrissey
    has retrograde amnesia, meaning amnesia for events prior to his brain injury,
    of at least several minutes to one-half hour before the injury occurred,
    and probably for 45 minutes. He cannot state the number of minutes with absolute
    certainty. There is moderate probability of memory loss for events in a period
    of hours before the injury occurred, but Dr. Salmon is less confident about
    that. The more one moves away from the time of the brain injury, the more
    questionable is the retrograde amnesia. During the period for which there
    is retrograde amnesia, it is possible that Mr. Morrissey has “islands”
    of memory, meaning discrete episodes that he is able to recall.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[13] Based on his interview of Mr. Morrissey, Dr. Salmon concluded
    that Mr. Morrissey has some recollection of events on the morning of the
    shooting, but very little recollection of anything after about [30-45 minutes
    prior to the shooting]. Dr. Salmon stated, however, that he did not question
    Mr. Morrissey very much about the specifics of that day.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[14] Dr. Salmon said that there are two possibilities with retrograde
    amnesia: either the person never formulated the memories to begin with, or
    lost any memories that were formed. In Dr. Salmon’s opinion, retrograde amnesia
    is more consistent with never having formulated a memory, and so the chances
    are extremely high that Mr. Morrissey never formed a memory of events for
    the several minutes up to the point of his gunshot injury. </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[15] Dr. Salmon testified that a brain-injured person can confabulate,
    meaning create a false memory of something for which he/she has no memory.
    The person cannot discern that the memory is false.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[16] Dr. Hy Bloom, a forensic psychiatrist, assessed Mr. Morrissey
    in late 2002, on the issue of fitness to stand trial. He concluded that Mr.
    Morrissey suffers from an organic amnestic disorder/frontal lobe syndrome.
    His opinion was that Mr. Morrissey was fit to stand trial. He testified at
    the fitness hearing that Mr. Morrissey’s deficits include an impaired ability
    to learn new information and to recall previously learned information. His
    strength is in remembering verbal information, especially if it has a theme.
    He has a problem remembering visual and spatial material and would need someone
    to read such material to him. He has some impulsivity, poor judgment, and
    a failure to monitor the potential negative consequences of what he says.
    These are features of frontal lobe syndrome. Dr. Bloom said that these limitations
    would be particularly relevant if Mr. Morrissey were to testify, but he noted
    that Mr. Morrissey was aware of each one of his limitations.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[17] Dr. Bloom does not have expertise in the field of neuropsychology,
    but he was prepared to accept Dr. Salmon’s opinion about Mr. Morrissey’s
    retrograde amnesia. Mr. Morrissey advised Dr. Bloom that he does not have
    memory for the events in question. Mr. Morrissey told Dr. Bloom that he and
    Ms. Pajkowski had got back together the week before the shooting and were
    trying to get on good terms. He recalled going to her place the week before
    to exchange possessions. He did not recall getting into his father’s gun
    cabinet. He recalled that the shooting took place on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Bathurst Street in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket and that he was driving his father’s Jeep. He told Dr. Bloom that
    his intention that day was to commit suicide. Although Dr. Bloom’s discussion
    with Mr. Morrissey about what took place on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Bathurst Street was fairly limited, he accepted that Mr. Morrissey did not
    have a clear independent memory of what had occurred (“the critical events”).</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>[18] Mr. Morrissey and his parents reported to Dr. Bloom that
    he confabulates. Dr. Bloom testified that this occurs principally in persons
    who are brain-damaged through injury or disease and have memory loss, for
    example as a result of alcohol abuse. It is a natural compensation process.
    There is a substantial risk that Mr. Morrissey has learned information about
    what happened from other sources, and that he has pieced information together
    like a tapestry. He may not know what he remembers, and what has come from
    another source. Anything that he has said, or might say, about the events
    may be untrue. <i>He is not capable of giving reliable information about
    the critical events, because of his lack of memory. If he took the witness
    stand he would have to say that he does not remember the critical events.</i> His
    brain injury is permanent and it is unlikely that in the future he will be
    able to recapture the memory he has lost, especially if he never laid it
    down in the first place. <i>Mr. Morrissey can communicate with counsel in
    the sense that he can have a conversation, but it does not seem that he is
    able to recount the critical events. In Dr. Bloom’s opinion, however, there

    the Incompetency Application, the appellant also relied on the testimony
    of Dr. Nathan Pollock, an expert in neuropsychology who had testified at
    the fitness hearing.  Dr. Pollock was also of the opinion that the appellant
    had suffered a very severe and permanent brain injury and that he was exhibiting
    symptoms consistent with frontal lobe injury.  He administered a number of
    tests to the appellant, concluding that the appellant had suffered a significant
    decline in intellectual functioning, quite likely as a result of the brain
    injury.  He found Mr. Morrissey to be in the low average range for general
    intelligence, average in verbal intelligence and borderline for non-verbal
    intelligence.  The appellant had virtually lost his ability to comprehend
    written material and to express himself in writing.  However, his capacity
    to understand spoken language and to express himself verbally was relatively
    unimpaired, as he had
    “adequate verbal abilities, including language comprehension and expression,
    recall of information and the ability to reason with words.”  Dr. Pollock
    was of the opinion that the appellant’s capacity to assimilate verbal information
    would allow him to understand the fundamentals of the trial process, including
    the roles of the individuals involved (judge, jury, lawyers, witnesses, the
    accused), the nature of the charges, the available pleas, the consequences
    of a conviction, and the meaning of an oath.  To the extent that the information
    Mr. Morrissey encountered in a legal proceeding would consist of orally presented
    or verbal material, Dr. Pollock felt that “he would be quite capable of adequately
    participating in his defence.”</p>

    competence and fitness, and to charge them on the elements of testimonial

    is the ability “to communicate <i>the evidence</i>”, communicating <i>the
    evidence</i> and communicating <i>with counsel</i> are not necessarily the
    same things.  Moreover, testimonial competence and fitness for trial are
    different, albeit related, concepts, and are founded upon different rationales.  In
    my view, therefore, although factors relating to an accused person’s ability
    to testify may be relevant to the fitness inquiry – as, indeed, the trial
    judge instructed the jury in this case – the testimonial competence of the
    accused, as contemplated at common law and pursuant to s. 16 of the <i>Canada

    is no dispute in this case that the appellant suffers from a mental disorder
    resulting from his brain injury.  He is diagnosed as having both an “amnestic
    disorder”
    and “frontal lobe syndrome”, each a mental disorder.  Nor is it disputed
    that he meets the first two specific criteria of fitness to stand trial,
    namely, that he understands the nature and object of the proceedings and
    that he understands their possible consequences.  The medical evidence amply
    supports those findings.  At issue, fundamentally, is whether the criterion
    that the appellant be able to
    “communicate with counsel” necessarily encompasses the standard that he be
    competent to testify and, in particular, that he be competent to testify
    about the critical events of the homicide and to relate them to his lawyer.  In

      this Court recognized that the new s. 2 definition “statutorily entrenches
      the extensive case law in this area” and concluded that to be found fit
      for trial an accused must satisfy a “limited cognitive capacity test.”  This
      threshold is not high.  Indeed, <i>Taylor</i> has been criticized in some
      parts of the academic and medical communities for setting the bar too low
      and allowing some individuals to be found fit when their ability to make
      necessary decisions about their trial is severely affected by mental illness:  see
      the commentaries collected in Barrett and Shandler, <i>Mental Disorder
      in Canadian Criminal Law</i> (Toronto: Thompson Carswell, 2006), pp. 3-6
      to 3-7, fn 15.  Nonetheless, the
    “limited cognitive capacity” test has been accepted across the country and
    was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Whittle</i> (1994),
    92 C.C.C. (3d) 11 at pp. 25-26.  It requires only a relatively rudimentary
    understanding of the judicial process – sufficient, essentially, to enable
    the accused to conduct a defence and to instruct counsel in that regard.  It
    is in that sense that the accused must be able “to communicate with counsel” and
    relate the facts concerning the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Taylor</i> test
    for limited cognitive capacity has been condensed in some authorities and
    commentaries – in my view, imprecisely – into a simple “inquiry into whether
    an accused can recount to his/her counsel the necessary facts relating to
    the offence in such a way that counsel can then properly present a defence” (<i>Taylor</i>, <i>supra</i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the concept that the accused must be able to recount “the necessary facts
    relating to the offence in such a way that counsel can then properly present
    a defence” must be interpreted in a purposive and functional manner, in my
    view.  It is intended to refer more broadly to the accused person’s ability
    to recount the facts generally relating to the offence or offences with which
    he or she has been charged.  It is not intended to narrow the inquiry solely
    to the ability to relate the immediate facts pertaining to the particular
    incident giving rise to the crime (<i>e.g.</i>, the immediate events surrounding
    the actual shooting in this case).  This makes sense, since the thrust of
    the concept of unfitness to stand trial is that the accused is unable to
    conduct a defence or to instruct counsel to do so.  The ability to communicate
    with counsel in the context of a fitness inquiry speaks to the ability to
    seek and receive legal advice.  An inability to recount the facts immediately
    connected with the event giving rise to the charges is not the same as an
    inability to communicate with counsel in a way that permits an accused to
    seek and receive effective legal advice.  Moreover, there are instances where
    an accused may wish to – or may be able to do nothing but – formulate a defence
    based on the contention that he or she is unable to remember the events in
    question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    even if the reference to the accused person’s ability to recount the facts
    relating to the offence is to be interpreted narrowly in the sense of the
    ability to recount the events surrounding the criminal incident itself, then
    in my view <i>Taylor</i> is misconceived as standing for that proposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making the comment referred to above, Lacourcière J.A. was simply reciting
    one of the submissions of <i>amicus curiae</i> on behalf of Mr. Taylor.  This
    was followed immediately by a summary of those submissions by <i>amicus curiae</i> that
    were accepted by Crown counsel, and which did not include the foregoing proposition.  Lacourcière
    J.A. did not say that the Court accepted the contention of <i>amicus curiae</i> in
    this regard.  Indeed, it was unnecessary for him to consider it, as the issue
    in the case was not whether Mr. Taylor could recall the events of the crime,
    but rather whether he was so delusional that he was unable to instruct counsel
    in a manner that was reflective of his own best interests.  It was the latter
    concern that was at issue in the case, and

    <i>Taylor</i> stands for the propositions that (a) the “limited cognitive

    know that he might challenge any of you to whom he may object -- <i>and to

    however, that he understood the nature of the proceedings and the functions
    of the persons involved in them. He knew what the issues were and the possible
    outcome of the proceedings. <i>The appellant, in their opinion, was able

    and might not act with good judgment</i>. The appellant did not want to be
    seen as mentally ill, and was opposed to the issue of insanity being considered
    by the Court. We concluded on the basis of the evidence of Dr. Fleming and
    Dr. Coulthard that the appellant was competent to instruct counsel: see <i>Reference

    of these authorities suggests that an accused person’s ability to relate

    <i>Taylor</i>, Lacourcière J.A. explained the rationale underpinning the
    fitness for trial concept.  At para. 50 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To determine
    whether the test should be modified as suggested by the respondent, one must
    remain cognizant of the rationale for the fitness rules in the first place.
    In order to ensure that the process of determining guilt is as accurate as
    possible, that the accused can participate in the proceedings or assist counsel
    in his/her defence, that the dignity of the trial process is maintained,
    and that, if necessary, the determination of a fit sentence is made possible, <i>the
    accused must have sufficient mental fitness to participate in the proceedings
    in a meaningful way</i>. At the same time, one must consider that principles
    of fundamental justice require that a trial come to a final determination
    without undue delay. The adoption of too high a threshold for fitness will
    result in an increased number of cases in which the accused will be found
    unfit to stand trial even though the accused is capable of understanding
    the process and anxious for it to come to completion. [Emphasis added].</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    standards of reliability and trustworthiness, on the other hand, are the
    principal underpinnings of testimonial competency concerns.  These are different
    goals than those underlying the requirement of fitness for trial.  As McLachlin
    J. (as she then was) noted with respect to testimonial competency, in <i>Marquard,
    supra</i>, at p. 219, “[t]he goal is not to ensure that the evidence is credible,
    but only to assure that it meets the minimum threshold of being receivable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    is no need, therefore, to collapse the notion of testimonial competence into
    the notion of fitness for trial in order to meet the objectives of either
    concept.  Mr. Breen argues, nonetheless, that because the appellant is incapable
    of communicating the evidence with respect to the critical events surrounding
    the homicide, the appellant is incompetent to testify; accordingly he must
    be declared unfit for trial because he is similarly incapable of communicating
    that evidence to his counsel.  In my view, however, there are two principal
    flaws in this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as indicated above, the ability to communicate the evidence (for purposes
    of testimonial competence) and the ability to communicate with counsel (for
    purposes of fitness for trial), are not the same concepts.  The former evokes
    the capacity to perceive, recollect, and communicate matters relating to
    the issues before the court.  The latter contemplates the ability to communicate
    with counsel for the purposes of conducting a defence, considering counsel’s
    advice, and giving instructions with respect to the defence.  As Carrothers
    J.A. put it in <i>R. v. Roberts, supra</i>, at p. 545 – in language that
    is still pertinent, albeit pre-<i>Charter</i>, and that was picked up by

    average range for verbal abilities, verbal memory and visual memory, although
    he was below average in visual-spatial and academic abilities.  According
    to Dr. Pollock, he was in the low average range for general intelligence,
    average in verbal intelligence and borderline for non-verbal intelligence.  His
    capacity to understand spoken language and to express himself verbally was
    relatively unimpaired.  While his ability to cope with written material is
    severely impaired, Dr. Bloom’s evidence was that this difficulty could be

    the relevance of <i>Steele</i> is in relation<i> </i>to Mr. Morrissey’s ability
    or inability to take the stand, if necessary.  <i>Steele</i> predates Parliament’s
    attempt to codify the common law respecting fitness for trial with the definition
    of “unfit to stand trial” in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The case
    has been cited with favour since the amendments as articulating the common
    law standard:  see, for example,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    <i>Taylor</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 33.  However, no authority has yet
    been required to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the amendment
    has incorporated the <i>Steele</i> criterion respecting the accused person’s
    ability “to take the stand if necessary”.  Nor, in my view, is it necessary
    to do so in this case.  For the reasons outlined above, it may well be that
    Mr. Morrissey is able to take the stand and, as a matter of law, there is
    a rebuttable presumption that he is competent to do so.  Whether the trial
    judge erred in declining to make a ruling on that issue because of his refusal

    accept for purposes of this appeal that, in a narrow sense, Mr. Morrissey
    may “lack testimonial competence” in relation to the critical events surrounding
    the homicide itself because of his inability to communicate the evidence
    in that regard.  In <i>Farley, supra</i>, Justice Doherty reiterated the
    distinction, drawn in <i>Marquard</i>, between the <i>capacity</i> to perceive,
    recollect and communicate, on the one hand, and the <i>actual ability</i> to
    do so with respect to specific events, on the other hand.  At p. 81, he added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A person may
    have the capacity to perceive, recall and recount and yet be unable to perform
    one or more of those functions in a given situation.  For example, a witness
    who genuinely has no recollection of the relevant events is not thereby rendered
    incompetent <i>unless that inability to recall is a reflection of the absence
    of the capacity to recall</i>.  It must also be stressed that the cognitive
    and communicative components of s. 16(3) set a relatively low threshold for
    testimonial capacity.  Once the capacity to perceive, remember and recount
    is established, any deficiencies in a particular witness’s perception, recollection,
    or narration go to the weight of that evidence and not the witness’s competence
    to testify: <i>R v. Marquard</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    do not think Justice Grange’s comment, which was <i>obiter</i>, is dispositive
    in these circumstances, however.  First, for the reasons outlined above,
    Mr. Morrissey may well be competent to give evidence in this case.  Secondly,
    the issue before the Court in <i>McLeod, Pinnock and Farquharson</i> was
    procedural, namely, whether counsel for a co-accused should have the right
    to participate in the cross-examination of witnesses at a fitness hearing.  That
    case did not concern the relationship between testimonial competence and
    fitness or, in particular – as this case does – the problem of whether retrograde
    amnesia relating to certain specific events necessarily renders an accused
    unfit to stand trial.  For the reasons articulated above, I am satisfied
    that the retrograde amnesia suffered by Mr. Morrissey did not, of itself,
    render him unfit to stand trial, and that there was an adequate basis on

line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her charge at the fitness hearing, the trial judge instructed the jury as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The third branch
    specifies:  is he unable, on account of mental disorder, to communicate with
    counsel? The test for this third branch is one of “limited cognitive capacity”.  The
    question is whether he can recount to counsel the necessary facts relating
    to the offence in such a way that counsel can then properly present a defence.  To
    that end he must be able to speak with counsel rationally, to understand
    questions and answer them in an intelligible fashion, and to make critical
    decisions on counsel’s advice, concerning the offence with which he is charged.  Amnesia
    for the events underlying the criminal charge will not, by itself, render
    an accused “unable to communicate with counsel”.  For example you can ask
    yourselves[:] Can Mr. Morrissey understand the evidence that is given by
    various witnesses so that he can confer with his counsel and give instructions?  Does
    he have the mental capacity to instruct his counsel upon the evidence in
    order to make full answer and defence to the charge?  Is he able to understand
    advice given by his counsel and to reach a decision as to whether he should
    or should not testify?  Does his mental condition prevent his counsel for
    [<i>sic</i>] obtaining a factual and truthful account of the event from him?  I
    remind you that amnesia for the events underlining the criminal charge will <i>not</i>,
    by itself, render an accused “unable to communicate with counsel”, and you
    must consider the questions I have suggested in that context. [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>

    see no error in these instructions.  Although I have earlier expressed some
    reservations about reducing the limited cognitive capacity test to an inquiry
    into whether the accused can recount to counsel the immediate facts relating
    to the offence, the trial judge’s instructions in this regard – if understood
    in that fashion – would not have adversely affected the appellant’s position.  The
    trial judge did not tell the jurors that Mr. Morrissey’s testimonial capacity
    to relate the critical events surrounding the shooting was a condition precedent
    to his fitness for trial, and instruct them on the elements of testimonial
    competence pursuant to s. 16 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  She made
    it clear, however, that the jury should reflect upon such factors as (a)
    his ability to understand the evidence and confer with counsel in that regard,
    (b) his ability to instruct counsel, (c) his ability to understand advice
    and decide whether or not to testify, and (d) his ability to provide his
    counsel with a factual and truthful account of the event.  Accordingly, in
    the context of considering the appellant’s ability to recount the necessary
    facts relating to the offence, generally, in order to permit counsel to present
    a defence, the jury was instructed to consider his ability to provide counsel
    with a factual and truthful account of the event, although not to treat the
    appellant’s ability in this latter respect as a condition precedent to his
    fitness to stand trial.  On this basis, the jury decided that Mr. Morrissey
    was fit.</p>

    incompetent to testify at trial and that this incompetence offended his constitutional
    right to testify in his own defence in order to make full answer and defence.  Relying
    on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Parrot</i>, [2001]
    1 S.C.R. 178, the trial judge held – quite properly, in my view – that it

    disability and that she was not “able to communicate” within the meaning
    of s. 16 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  It sought to have her out-of-court
    statements admitted for the truth of their contents.  At a hearing to determine
    the complainant’s testimonial competence the Crown declined to call the complainant,
    relying completely, instead, on the evidence of experts who testified as
    to her frailties and abilities as a potential witness.  The trial judge accepted
    the expert opinion and ruled that the complainant lacked testimonial capacity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court held that this procedure was wrong and that the trial judge
    had erred in failing to hear from the complainant and to reach his own opinion
    as to her testimonial competence.  Writing for the majority, Binnie J. concluded
    that the trial judge should not have admitted the expert evidence on the <i>voir
    dire</i> because “[t]rial judges are eminently qualified to assess the testimonial
    competence of a witness” (para. 52).  Referring to the requirement under
    s. 16 that a witness be “able to communicate the evidence”, he wrote as follows
    (paras. 57-58):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Whether a
      complainant </i>“<i>is able to communicate the evidence</i>”<i> in this
      broad sense is a matter on which a trial judge can (and invariably does)
      form his or her own opinion</i>.  It is not a matter ‘outside the experience
      and knowledge of a judge or jury’ (<i>Mohan </i>[(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d)
      402 (S.C.C.)] <i>… </i>at p. 23).  It is the very meat and potatoes of
      a trial court’s existence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Mohan</i> required
    a demonstration of practical necessity as a precondition to reception of
    expert evidence because of the concern ‘that experts not be permitted to
    usurp the functions of the trier of fact’ (p. 24).  <i>In my view, it was
    the trial judge not </i>[<i>the expert</i>] <i>who was familiar with the
    exigencies of a criminal trial and who had the expertise to determine what
    testimonial assistance the complainant might be able to offer in that context.  His
    decision ought to have been based on direct observations of the complainant</i>,
    unless excused by evidence that she would be traumatized by an appearance
    in court even for that limited purpose, or other exceptional circumstances.

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were no other circumstances excusing the Crown from calling the complainant
    in <i>Parrot</i>, and none is raised here.  In her ruling the trial judge
    correctly concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Fleming
    has challenged the mental capacity of Mr. Morrissey as a proposed witness.  Given
    the majority decision in <i>R. v. Parrott</i>, I am unable to accept the
    submission that I should decide whether Mr. Morrissey is competent based
    on the evidence of the experts at the fitness hearing and the related written
    material.  In order for that challenge to be decided, the inquiry described
    in <i>Parrot</i> is necessary.  I, of course, cannot require
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mr. Morrissey to testify, nor can the Crown.  However, if the defence wishes
    to proceed with this <u> Charter</u> application, on which it bears the onus
    on a balance of probabilities, it will be necessary for me to hear from Mr.
    Morrissey so that I can make the direct observations referred to in <i>Parrot</i>.
    There is no suggestion that Mr. Morrissey would be traumatized or otherwise
    suffer adverse consequences from a s. 16 inquiry.  It will be up to the defence
    to determine how it wishes to proceed, in light of this Ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence declined to call Mr. Morrissey.  The Incompetency Application was
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Breen seeks to distinguish <i>Parrot</i> on the basis that the claim for
    incompetence in that case was founded upon a present inability to communicate,
    rather than on any cognitive incapacity.  Here, the argument is that the
    appellant lacks the capacity to communicate the critical events surrounding
    the homicide and that this incapacity can only be established by the expert
    evidence.  There was nothing Mr. Morrissey could have added to that discussion,
    he contends.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that there may be a distinction between the foundation for the communicative
    difficulties of the complainant in <i>Parrot</i> and the appellant in this
    case.  In my view, however, it does not detract from the general proposition
    articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada that on a s. 16 inquiry the potential
    witness should normally be called to testify, thus enabling the trial judge
    to base his or her decision on direct observations of the potential witness
    as well as other evidence.  As McLachlin J. noted in <i>Marquard</i> (p.
    219):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Generally speaking, <i>the
      best gauge of capacity is the witness’s performance at the time of trial</i>.  The
      procedure at common law has generally been to allow a witness who <i>demonstrates</i> capacity
      to testify at trial to testify. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Here,
    there was no indication that Mr. Morrissey would have been traumatized or
    otherwise adversely affected by testifying at the competency inquiry.  No
    argument was made that the appellant was entitled to rely upon his right
    to be protected against self-incrimination.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

    trial judge was aptly positioned to weigh these factors, along with the evidence
    about the appellant’s brain injury-induced amnesia and his tendency to confabulate.  Without
    his presence in the witness box, however, she was deprived of the opportunity
    to assess Mr. Morrissey based on her own “direct observations” – to engage
    in “the very meat and potatoes” of her work as a trial judge, to reiterate
    Justice Binnie’s words in <i>Parrott </i>– in order to come to her own conclusion
    as to his testimonial capacity.  She correctly declined to make the ruling
    on testimonial capacity without having that opportunity.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the trial judge err in finding no violation of the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter </i>right
    to make full answer and defence. While this issue was not pursued by Mr.
    Breen in oral argument, the violation of s. 7 was raised as a ground of appeal.  In <i>R.
    v. Rose</i>, [1998] 129 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at paras. 102-103, the Supreme Court
    described two discrete aspects to the s. 7 right to make full answer and
    defence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>One aspect is the right of the accused to have before him or her the full
    ‘case to meet’ before answering the Crown’s case by adducing defence evidence …
    A second and broader aspect of the right … is the right of an accused person
    to defend himself or herself against all of the state’s efforts to achieve
    a conviction.  The Crown is not entitled to engage in activities aimed at
    convicting an accused unless that accused is permitted to defend against
    those state acts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the appellant had the opportunity to defend himself against
    all of the Crown’s efforts to obtain a conviction.  The trial judge correctly
    noted in her ruling on the broader stay application (177 C.C.C. (3d) 428
    at para. 27) that the appellant was able to cross-examine Crown witnesses,
    to call defence witnesses, and even to adduce evidence to support the theory
    that the shooting was unintentional.  The appellant could have taken the
    stand to testify on the Incompetency Application; he ultimately chose not
    to.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is likely that the appellant’s brain injury and ensuing retrograde amnesia
    had some impact on the manner in which he was able to conduct his defence,
    they have not so interfered with his ability to defend himself that it can
    be said that he was denied his constitutional right to make full answer and
    defence.  As the trial judge noted – drawing upon the statement of La Forest
    J. in <i>R. v. Lyons</i> (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p.&nbsp;46 – “s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> entitles the appellant to a fair hearing; it does not
    entitle him/her to the most favourable procedures that could possibly be
    imagined.”: see also <i>R. v. Mills</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at para.
    72; and <i>Rose</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 99.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mills</i>,
    moreover, at para. 72, the Supreme Court recognized that the content of the
    constitutional right to make full answer and defence is informed by interests
    beyond simply those of the accused:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>… [T]he principles of fundamental justice do not entitle the accused to
    ‘the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined.’ This is
    because fundamental justice embraces more than the rights of the accused.  For
    example, this Court has held that an assessment of the fairness of the trial
    process must be made ‘from the point of view of fairness in the eyes of the
    community and the complainant’ and not just the accused: <i>R. v. E. (A.W.)</i>,
    [1993] 3 S.C.R. 155, <i>per</i> Cory J., at p. 198
    … <i>The ability to make full answer and defence, as a principle of fundamental
    justice, must therefore be understood in light of other principles of fundamental
    justice which may embrace interests and perspectives beyond those of the
    accused</i>. [Emphasis added.  Some citations omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are strong policy reasons for concluding that a claim of memory loss respecting
    the critical events in question, by itself, ought not to provide the foundation
    for a stay of proceedings – regardless of the cause of that disability.  For
    one thing, such a loss of memory is a prevalent claim (30-40% of people charged
    with a violent crime, perhaps more, claim to be affected by amnesia in relation
    to the crime).<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a>  For another, it is an easy claim to make and
    a difficult one to disprove: see <i>R. v. L.J.H., supra</i>, at p. 89.  If
    a claim of amnesia is available to support an abuse of process application
    under the <i>Charter</i> in cases such as this, it could lead to many cases
    being stayed in a manner that is not in the public interest.  I agree completely
    with, and adopt, the following statement by Justice Fuerst in her ruling
    on the broader stay application (177 C.C.C. (3d) 428, at para.&nbsp;34):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In fact, Dr.
    Bloom testified that amnesia is a feature of a very substantial percentage
    of cases of accused persons charged with violent crimes.  He indicated that
    30 to 40 per cent of people charged with crimes of violence claim amnesia.  Similarly,
    in <i>R v. Stone</i>…,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[11]</span></span></span></a> the Crown’s expert witness testified at trial
    that up to 50 per cent of people charged with serious crimes report that
    they do not remember the incident.  If Mr. Fleming’s submission were correct,
    a large number of accused persons would be entitled to claim exemption from
    prosecution on constitutional grounds, because of lack of memory.  I am unable
    to conclude that the <i>Charter</i>’s fair trial rights are this far-ranging.  As
    has been pointed out, the amnesiac’s loss of memory differs only in degree
    from that experienced by other persons not suffering from amnesia: see
