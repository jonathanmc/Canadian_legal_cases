  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial unfolded over 45 days.  At the conclusion of the evidence, and on the
    cusp of closing submissions, the trial judge declared a mistrial.  He did so on his own motion and over the
    objections of both the Crown and the accused because, in his view, he might be
    perceived as being biased against the accused.  The basis for his decision was the fact that he had previously written
    letters of reference for the court reporter in the case who had just testified
    as a witness after the accused had challenged the production of transcripts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown brought an application for an order in the
    nature of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> quashing the mistrial order
    made by the trial judge.  The application
    judge, Nordheimer J., made the requested order and ordered the trial judge to
    “continue and complete” the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who opposed the mistrial order when the
    trial judge raised it, now appeals the application judge’s order quashing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no merit in the appeal.  I agree with the application judge’s order
    and with his reasons for making the order.  In saying this, I wish to highlight three aspects of the application
    judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I agree with the application judge that it is
    regrettable that the trial judge allowed the accused (who was representing
    himself at this juncture in the trial) to call the court reporter as a
    witness.  As the application judge said,
    “it remains the fact that the issue respecting the transcripts was collateral
    to any decision regarding the merits of the prosecution itself.”  In addition, on a broader plane, I endorse the
    following observation by the application judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t should be the rare case where a court official
    such as a court reporter is compelled to participate in the trial itself.  It is important that court reporters, as with
    all court officers, should not only be neutral between the parties but should
    also be seen as being neutral.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, there was no basis for the trial judge’s
    conclusion that he could not continue to preside at the trial because he might
    be perceived as being biased against the accused.  I agree with the application judge on this
    point:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he trial judge did not at any point state that
    the circumstances surrounding the transcripts issue had, in any fashion,
    coloured the trial judge’s attitude towards Mr. Toutissani or otherwise
    prejudiced his position before the court.  The trial judge did not say that he was not able to fairly and
    impartially adjudicate on the charges before him.  Rather, the declaration of a mistrial was
    based entirely on the trial judge’s concern that there might be an apprehension
    of bias by Mr. Toutissani even though Mr. Toutissani had not made any such
    suggestion.  To the contrary, Mr.
    Toutissani was imploring the trial judge to continue to complete the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge’s analysis on this
    point is entirely consistent with the leading cases dealing with judicial bias,
    including <i>R. v. S. (R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3
    S.C.R. 484, <i>Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada</i>,
    [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259, and <i>Mugesera v.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 91.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, I explicitly endorse the application judge’s
    statement that “[t]he declaration of a mistrial, like the declaration of a
    stay, should be granted only as a last resort, in the clearest of cases and
    where no remedy short of that relief will adequately redress the actual harm
    occasioned.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is good reason for such a strong statement, as
    highlighted by this case.  A seemingly
    simple criminal trial consumed 45 days of court time spread over an incredible
    81 months.  Near the end of the trial,
    the trial judge declared a mistrial, and he did so over the objections of both
    the Crown and the accused.  The “actual
    harm” caused by this ruling was a manifest failure of justice for the
    prosecution and accused alike, a substantial allocation of court resources and
    staff to no effect, and dislocation and stress experienced by many witnesses,
    again to no effect.  It is crucial that
    trial judges try to avoid these consequences.  The application judge’s reasoning and order are faithful to this goal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
