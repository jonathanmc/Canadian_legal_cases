  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for first
    degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grounds of appeal relate primarily to alleged
    errors in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. Of these grounds, only one was
    raised before the trial judge. That is telling in this case. It leads us to
    conclude that experienced defence counsel [not Mr. Breen] was satisfied with
    the instructions that the appellant now contends, for the first time, amounted
    to reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main ground relates to the trial judge’s alleged
    failure to adequately explain the difference between murder and manslaughter,
    and in particular, to distinguish the mental elements between those offences.
    As well, the appellant alleges that the trial judge shifted the onus by
    suggesting that affirmative evidence of an absence of intention was necessary
    for the jury to return a verdict of guilty on manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The trial judge correctly explained the
    mental elements for murder and manslaughter on numerous occasions in the charge.
    The specific passages to which the appellant refers do not, in our view,
    undermine these instructions when the charge is read as a whole, a point
    reinforced by the absence of any objection from trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground relates to the trial judge’s
    instructions on after-the-fact evidence and the use the jury could make of it. We
    would not give effect to that ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in the submission that the trial judge
    improperly included items of evidence in the “after-the-fact evidence” basket that
    he should not have. The after-the-fact evidence in this case was not typical;
    rather it was directly relevant and had a direct bearing on the issue of
    planning and deliberation. The trial judge fully explained the position of the
    defence as to the inferences the defence urged the jury to draw from the
    after-the-fact evidence. Moreover, in the re-charge, following an objection
    from defence counsel, the trial judge adequately explained the need to be alert
    to other explanations as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Please also
    remember the importance of your deciding whether the evidence that I point out
    relates to the act of murder that the Crown alleges that the accused did, and
    not some underlying criminal offence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>That
    instruction was sufficient in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in effectively instructing the jury that the defence theory that the deceased
    may have died of natural causes was unsupported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this submission. In the
    impugned passage, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that if they found
    such evidence, they were to consider it and in the final analysis, the burden
    rested on the Crown to prove that the death was attributable to culpable
    homicide. Moreover, throughout the charge, the trial judge repeatedly told the
    jury that they were the ultimate arbiters of the facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we see no merit in the submission that the
    trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury to disregard the evidence of
    Mr. Ross concerning his “impression” that the deceased was fearful of the
    appellant. While the trial judge did not give a specific instruction relating
    to Mr. Ross, he told the jury that they were to ignore evidence of impressions
    given by all of the witnesses who reported conversations with the deceased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the submission that the Crown, in his closing
    address, improperly commented on the failure of the appellant to testify with
    his “show us the body” comment, we do not interpret that comment that way and
    in the circumstances, we are satisfied that it did not go beyond the limits of
    appropriate argument. In any event, we note that the trial judge told the jury
    on numerous occasions that the onus rested with the Crown and that there was no
    burden on the appellant to prove anything.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That leaves the fresh evidence. In our view, it does
    not pass the fourth test in <i>Palmer</i>.
    Considered with the other evidence, it could not reasonably be expected to have
    affected the verdict. At best, the blood purge evidence could suggest a natural
    death but in this case, the circumstantial evidence pointing to culpable
    homicide was so powerful that the blood purge evidence could not reasonably be
    expected to have led to a different verdict. The fresh evidence application is
    denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
