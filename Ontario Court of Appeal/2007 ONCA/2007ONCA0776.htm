style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a trial before Justice Helen Rady of the Superior Court of Justice, the appellant
    was convicted of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He
    appeals his convictions on both counts.  He also appealed his sentence of
    eighteen months but has since abandoned his sentence appeal.</p>
  <h2>The Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant in this case, K.B., was born on February 28, 1988.  The conduct
    about which K.B. complained occurred when she was in grades five and six
    between the ages of eleven and thirteen years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant was a close school friend of the appellants daughter, A.K.  In
    about September of 1999, when the complainant and A.K. were in grade five,
    the complainant regularly visited the K. residence with A.K.  She often went
    to the K. residence at lunch hour and after school between 4:00 p.m. and
    6:00 p.m.  It was during the afternoon visits that, with two exceptions,
    the alleged sexual abuse is said to have occurred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified that she would go to the K. residence with A.K. after
    school.  They would play Nintendo games, do homework, watch television or
    play with A.K.s younger brother.  These activities took place, for the most
    part, in a large room in the basement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was involved in a business related to the building of brick driveways.  The
    business was seasonal and during most of the school year he was either not
    working and at home or he would arrive home about 4:30 or 5:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified about an event that occurred not long after she started
    going to the K. residence.  She was sitting on a sofa, playing Nintendo,
    in the basement.  A.K. left the room and the appellant entered shortly thereafter.  The
    appellant sat beside the complainant.  He put his arm around her shoulder,
    put his hand under her t-shirt and touched her breast.  He attempted to put
    his hand inside her underwear.  The complainant told the appellant to leave
    her alone and got up and left.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus
    began a prolonged series of similar assaults during the school years of 1999
    to 2000 and 2000 to 2001.  In examination-in-chief, the complainant said
    that there were in total at least 30 such assaults.  She testified in cross-examination
    that these assaults occurred on average two to four times a week.  She estimated
    that each assault lasted thirty to sixty seconds.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the above described sexual abuse, the complainant testified that
    once or twice a week during these episodes, the appellant would pull down
    his pants and expose his penis.  On one occasion, the appellant placed the
    complainants hand on his penis which she described as hard.  Sometimes,
    when he exposed his penis, it was hard.  At other times it was soft.  A few
    times the appellant rubbed his penis until he ejaculated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no time did Mrs. K., A.K. or A.K.s brother (who was seven or eight years
    old at the time) come into the room and see anything. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified to two incidents which are different from the alleged
    abuse in the appellants basement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first incident occurred when the complainant was on a sleep-over at the
    K. residence.  A.K. and the complainant slept in the living room.  A.K. slept
    on a couch.  The complainant slept on a chair and an adjoining stool, which
    were pulled together as a makeshift bed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant was wearing pants and underwear and was awakened to find the
    appellant kneeling beside her chair, his head under the sheet, licking her
    vagina.  The complainant made a startled noise which awakened A.K.  A.K.
    asked her father what he was doing over there?  The appellant replied that
    he was looking for a mouse.  Everyone then went back to sleep.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second incident occurred on an outing to the Wheels Inn in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chatham,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Just prior to the beginning of the new school year in September
    2001, the K. family, together with the complainant, took a mini-holiday at
    the Wheels Inn.  They stayed overnight on Saturday night.  The Wheels Inn
    had a large swimming pool, a small amusement park with various rides, a bowling
    alley and a range of games to play.  Both the complainant and A.K. participated
    in a number of activities.  On Saturday night, the K. family and the complainant
    had dinner together at the inn and then the complainant and A.K. continued
    to enjoy the amusements that were on offer.  I note that there are differing
    accounts from the witnesses as to specifically what the two girls did after
    dinner and before turning in for the night.  That said, I do not believe
    those differing accounts are particularly relevant to the case at bar.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    Saturday night, the group slept in the same hotel room.  Mr. and Mrs. K.
    slept in one of the two beds.  A.K. slept in a cot placed at the end of her
    parents bed.  The complainant and the brother of A.K. slept in the other
    bed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant put on a nightgown and her underwear.  The complainant testified
    that she fell asleep while watching a movie and later woke up to find the
    appellant licking her vagina.  Her nightgown was still on but her underwear
    had disappeared.  The others in the room were asleep except for the appellant.  The
    complainant told the appellant to stop, then she kicked him in the head.  This
    incident lasted about thirty seconds.  The complainant then got up and went
    into the bathroom and locked the door.  She came out of the bathroom five
    to ten minutes later and went back to sleep.  Nobody else woke up during
    this incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the beginning of the school year in September 2001, the complainant stopped
    going to the K. residence. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the period of the sexual assaults taking place, the complainant spoke to
    her friend, A.K., on two occasions when she complained about the conduct
    of the appellant.  She asked A.K. to speak to her father.  On the first occasion,
    the appellant came downstairs and called the complainant a liar.  There was
    no response to the second complaint.  It was not until March of 2002 that
    the complainant told her story to another friend and the friends mother.  The
    matter was subsequently reported to the police, resulting in these charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant said that she did not speak to others about these incidents because
    she did not know the appellants conduct was wrong although she felt uncomfortable
    and nervous.  She first learned about good and bad touching in grade six.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mrs.
    K. testified that at no time during the nearly two year period did she observe
    anything out of the ordinary as between her husband and the complainant.  Mrs.
    K. recalled the night when she heard the dog barking and her husband was
    looking for a mouse.  She did not think it was a big thing and she went
    back to bed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the Wheels Inn incident, Mrs. K. recalled that between 3:00 and
    4:00 a.m. she awoke and noticed that the complainant appeared to be falling
    out of bed.  She asked her husband to put the complainant back in her bed
    which he did.  She did not hear any noises in the night and noticed nothing
    unusual about the complainants demeanour in the morning.  The complainants
    mother, who testified, said that when she picked up her daughter after the
    trip she appeared happy and had enjoyed the outing.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early September 2001, there was somewhat of a <i>contretemps</i> between
    Mrs. K. and the complainant.  Over the course of two or three days, the complainant
    was acting in a rambunctious manner with the family dog and apparently interfering
    with the speech therapy lessons of the complainants brother.  As a result,
    Mrs. K. told the complainant that she should stay away for a week.  According
    to Mrs. K. the complainant never returned to the K. residence after this
    episode.  </p>

    gave similar evidence.  At no time did she notice anything out of the ordinary
    between her father and the complainant.  A.K. denied that the complainant
    ever spoke to her about her fathers inappropriate behaviour.  In respect
    of the sleep-over, she recalled waking up when the dog was barking.  She
    noticed her father on the floor.  He was on his hands and knees looking for
    a mouse  in the dark.  She fell asleep after her father left.  The complainant
    acted normally the next morning.  On the night at Wheels Inn, she has no
    recollection of waking up.  She heard no noises or commotion.</p>

    order to rebut the evidence of the complainant concerning her allegation
    that the appellant, on numerous occasions, exposed his erect penis, the defence
    called Dr. Gerald Brock, a urologist.  Dr. Brock testified that he first
    saw the appellant in October 2002 in respect of a complaint of erectile dysfunction.  He
    diagnosed the appellants condition as in the most severe category.  The
    appellant was almost a poster boy for the risk factors for erectile dysfunction  his
    cholesterol and triglyceride levels were at the very highest levels recordable
    and he had a thirty-year history of smoking two to three packs per day.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Brock offered an opinion that in the time frame of September 1999 to June
    2001 it was highly unlikely that the appellant would have been able to get
    an erection within thirty to sixty seconds.  He also testified that he could
    not be categorical that the appellant could not experience an erection.</p>

    K. testified that she had not had sexual relations with the appellant since
    1997 because he was incapable of achieving an erection and he was not really
    interested.  However, they did have a loving relationship and her husband
    would cuddle and fondle her.</p>
  <h2>The Trial Judges Reasons </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the evidence, the trial judge indicated that she accepted the testimony
    of the complainant as truthful.  She found that the complainant, although
    nervous at first, was less so as her evidence progressed.  The trial judge
    found that the complainants evidence
    was not really disturbed in cross-examination.  The trial judge was impressed
    by the fact that the complainant readily adopted her answers given at the
    preliminary hearing where they differed from her evidence at trial.  The
    trial judge also took into account the complainants age when these events
    occurred.  She said, [One] must be careful not to impute to a child an adults
    understanding of terms like erection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge suggested that the evidence of Mrs. K. and A.K. should be accorded
    little weight.  She found that Mrs. K.s and A.K.s evidence should be viewed
    with suspicion because they had been actively involved in the defence of
    the charges against the appellant  also they were both present during most
    of the Crowns case except that A.K. was not present for her mothers evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that A.K.s evidence did not detract from the complainants
    evidence in any significant way.  A.K.s evidence about the mouse incident
    was corroborative of the complainants evidence to the extent that she described
    her father on his hands and knees close to where the complainant was sleeping
    in the dark.  In respect of this evidence, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In fact, it defies credibility that the accused
    was in the living-room for any reason other than that described by [the com-plainant].  It
    is difficult, if not impossible, to accept that [Mr. K.] was going to catch
    a mouse with his bare hands in the dark.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the expert evidence of Dr. Brock, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dr. Brocks evidence was of limited assistance to
    the court.  He did not see the accused for the first time until October,
    2002, after these charges had been brought.  He agreed that motivation could
    play a role in [Mr. K.s] condition and he could not guarantee that his patient
    could not get an erection or a partial erection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded her reasons for judgment as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In conclusion, I accept the evidence of the complainant Where
    the evidence of [the complainant] and the defence witnesses differ, I prefer
    the evidence of the complainant.  Put another way, the evidence of the defence
    witnesses does not create a reasonable doubt in my mind.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Even though I accept the evidence of the complainant
    and reject the evidence of the defence, I must still be satisfied that the
    Crown has proven all elements of these charges beyond a reasonable doubt.  I
    am so satisfied.  The offences occurred at the times and places as alleged
    in the indictment.  And the actions of the accused as described by [the complainant],
    which I accept as fact, make out the necessary elements of the offences charged
    beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h2>The Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to take into account
    the impossibility of the alleged acts of sexual abuse having occurred.  He
    further submits that the trial judges reasoning contains logical inconsistencies.  As
    a result, he argues that the convictions are unreasonable.  In particular,
    counsel for the appellant submits:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it
    was physically impossible for the appellant to have carried out the acts
    complained of at the frequency alleged over a period of two years without
    discovery given that there was always someone else in the house;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    is a logical inconsistency in the complainant returning to the K. residence
    several times a week when she knew she would likely face unwanted sexual
    advances from the appellant.  She had other friends whom she could have visited
    and avoided going to the appellants residence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    logical inconsistency exists in that the appellants son did not wake up
    during the Wheels Inn incident when he was sleeping in the same bed as the
    complainant.  The complainant would have to have been moved in order to remove
    her underwear and carry out the alleged assault;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    is a logical inconsistency in that the complainant did not yell or make some
    other startled comment during the Wheels Inn incident;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    were major inconsistencies in the complainants evidence beyond the complainants
    inability to remem-ber times and dates such as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)   exposure by the appellant, including ejacu-lation,
    could not be remembered at all until the complainants preliminary hearing
    evi-dence was read to her; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)
      no Nintendo game was in the K. residence, when the first incident occurred
    and none was acquired until several months later.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    trial judge erred in her treatment of Dr. Brocks evidence and the erectile
    dysfunction issue.  </p>
  <h2>The Test for Unreasonable Verdict </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test for unreasonable verdict has been established and confirmed in a number
    of cases.  The test is whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed
    jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.  See <i>Corbett
    v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275 at 282; <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987]
    2 S.C.R. 168 at 179-80; and <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at
    para. 42.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the test refers to a jury verdict, it is applicable to a judge sitting alone
    without a jury.  See <i>Biniaris, supra,</i> at para. 37.</p>
  <h2>The Application of the Test to this Case</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Arbour J. said in <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The review for unreasonableness on appeal is different,
    however, and somewhat easier when the judgment under attack is that of a
    single judge, at least when reasons for judgment of some substance are provided.  In
    those cases, the reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw
    in the evaluation of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to
    explain the unreasonable conclusion reached, and justify the reversal.  The
    court of appeal will therefore be justified to intervene and set aside a
    verdict as unreasonable when the reasons of the trial judge reveal that he
    or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict
    inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.  These discernable defects
    are themselves sometimes akin to a separate error of law, and therefore easily
    sustain the conclusion that the unreasonable verdict which rests upon them
    also raises a question of law.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>This in effect is what the appellant
    asks us to do in this case.  He points to various portions of the reasons
    as disclosing flaws in the evaluation of the evidence and in the analysis
    of that evidence that explain what he says is an unreasonable verdict.  He
    does not raise any of these flaws as independent grounds of appeal.  I therefore
    turn to consider each of these flaws, bearing in mind, however, at the end
    of the day that even where there are some flaws in the reasoning process,
    a verdict will be reasonable when rendered by a trial judge as by a jury
    if the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially,
    could reasonably have rendered.</p>
  <h2>            (i)        The physical impossibility</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Many
    of the assaults were, by their description, of very short duration.  They
    involved grabbing or touching the breast area and the vaginal area after
    which the complainant would leave the room.  It is not unreasonable to conclude
    that these assaults occurred in a matter of seconds when no one other than
    the appellant was in the room.  The assaults that involved exposure of the
    appellants penis and masturbation are more troubling.  As well, the complainants
    evidence, if taken literally, suggests that the assaults involving the penis
    totalled close to 150 in number and the total number of assaults approached
    300.  It would have been preferable for the trial judge to have addressed
    this evidence in her reasons.  However, I am not persuaded that her failure
    to do so leads to a conclusion that her decision was unreasonable.  She is
    not required to address every piece of evidence in her reasons and it is
    clear from reading the entirety of her reasons that she had a full grasp
    of the evidence.  </p>
  <h2>(ii)      The logical inconsistency in the complainant returning to the
    K. residence day after day</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accepted that the complainant did not know that the conduct of
    the appellant was wrong until she learned about the distinction between good
    and bad touching at school.  The trial judges assessment of the complainants
    evidence is, in my view, a reasonable answer to this issue: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The complainant] is not a sophisticated or a worldly
    witness.  She repeated grade three.  In my view, she is not clever enough
    to concoct the mouse incident, for example, and turn it into a sexual encounter.  Indeed,
    her testimony, taken as a whole, had a ring of truth.  It is not unusual,
    in my view, for there to be a delay in reporting these incidents to the authorities.  [The
    complainant] was a pre-teenager when these events occurred, and it is not
    unusual for a child of her years to take some time to reconcile what has
    happened.  I accept her evidence that she did not appreciate that the accuseds
    behaviour was wrong.</p>
  <h2>(iii)     The logical inconsistency concerning the failure of the appellants
    son to wake up during the Wheels Inn incident</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant conducted a detailed cross-examination of the complainant
    on the Wheels Inn incident including the fact that the appellants son was
    lying next to her in the same bed and apparently did not wake up.  The issue
    was clearly highlighted by the defence.  The trial judge accepted the complainants
    evidence which she was entitled to do.</p>
  <h2>(iv)      The logical inconsistency in the failure of the complainant to
    yell during the Wheels Inn incident</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence is that the complainant raised her voice and told the appellant
    to stop that and then kicked him in the head.  The trial judge obviously
    accepted the complainants evidence on this point.</p>
  <h2>(v)       The major inconsistencies in the complainants evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the complainant could not remember the appellant
    exposing his penis (which included ejaculation) until the complainants preliminary
    hearing transcript was read to her.  During the cross-examination, the complainant
    testified that the appellant also ejaculated a couple of times as a result
    of masturbation.  She was not cross-examined on the alleged inconsistency
    concerning ejaculation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant further submits that the trial judge failed to take into
    account the complainants mistake in thinking that the Nintendo game was
    in the K. house in September 1999 when she testified that the assaults commenced.  It
    is clear that the trial judge was aware of this contradiction in her evidence
    and determined that it did not have an adverse effect on her credibility:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   There were some discrepancies in [the complainants]
    testimony and the others.  She had difficulty recalling events sequentially
    which, in my view, does not detract from her credibility.  She thought that
    she and [A.K.] played Nintendo in September, 1999, but it appears that the
    game was not purchased until a year later.  It is possible that [the comp-lainant]
    was simply mistaken on this point.  Clearly, [at] some point during her two
    years of visits to the [K.] home, Nintendo was in fact played.</p>
  <h2>(vi)      The trial judge erred in her treatment of Dr. Brocks evidence
    and the erectile dysfunction issue </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    most troubling aspect of the appellants argument is that the trial judge
    reached an unreasonable verdict because she failed to properly deal with
    Dr. Brocks evidence.  The appellant relied upon the evidence of Dr. Brock
    to raise a reasonable doubt that it was physically possible for him to achieve
    an erection or orgasm in the manner described by the complainant.    He submits
    that if the complainant lied about this aspect of her evidence then none
    of her evidence could reasonably found a verdict to the criminal standard
    of proof.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence of Dr. Brock related to the specific medical diagnosis of erectile
    dysfunction.  Counsel for the appellant cross-examined the complainant by
    referring to an erection, a term which she did not understand.  The complainant
    described what she observed of the appellants penis as hard or soft without
    any further elaboration.  Counsel for the appellant did not seek to qualify
    her observation in any further detail.  He equated the description hard with
    an erection.  Dr. Brock, on the other hand, gave an elaborate medical definition
    of erection by reference to a scale of one to ten.  Whether or not the appellants
    penis, on occasion, appeared or felt hard to this young complainant does
    not, in my view, necessarily discredit her evidence and does not result in
    an unreasonable verdict.  This is particularly so in view of the trial judges
    description of the complainant as
    not a sophisticated or a worldly witness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    in reference to the complainants understanding of the term erection, the
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>More importantly, however, is the need to keep
    in mind [the complainants] age when these events occurred.  One must be
    careful not to impute to a child an adults understanding of terms like erection.  [The
    complainants] evidence on this issue used comparative descriptors, namely
    soft and hard.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge was entitled to
    reach this conclusion about the complainants understanding of the term
    erection, which explains why even accepting Dr. Brocks evidence, it was
    not unreasonable to accept the complainants evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge placed an unreasonable burden
    on the defence by dismissing Dr. Brocks evidence because he could not guarantee that
    the appellant could not achieve an erection.  In other circumstances, this
    kind of comment could well be symptomatic of an unreasonable verdict.  However,
    since the trial judge had already explained why even accepting Dr. Brocks
    evidence, it was not inconsistent with the complainants version of events,
    this comment is of no moment.  In any event, I tend to think that at this
    point the trial judge was merely summarizing Dr. Brocks own admission that
    he could not be categorical in his opinion concerning the ability of the
    appellant to achieve an erection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant further submits that the trial judges reference to Dr.
    Brock agreeing that motivation could play a role in [Mr. K.s] condition makes
    no sense.  Counsel argues that this observation is a further indication that
    the verdict is unreasonable.  The trial judges reference to this evidence
    is in error.  Dr. Brock, in cross-examination, arguably agreed that the criminal
    charges could be the motivation for seeking an opinion concerning erectile
    dysfunction.  Dr. Brock did not say that motivation could play a role in
    the appellants condition.  That said, I am not satisfied that this error,
    either alone or taken with the other issues raised by the appellant, renders
    the verdict unreasonable.</p>
