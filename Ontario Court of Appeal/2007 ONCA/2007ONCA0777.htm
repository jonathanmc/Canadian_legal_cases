style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of the theft of tools and the attempted break and
    enter of commercial premises.  He was sentenced to nine months incarceration
    for the attempted break and enter and five months consecutive on the theft
    under, followed by eighteen months probation.  He received credit on a two
    for one basis on the theft under charge in respect of sixteen days of pre-sentence
    custody.  He appeals his sentence, arguing that the trial judge erred: first,
    by imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences; second, by failing
    to impose a conditional sentence; and third, by failing to credit the appellant
    for pre-trial bail on strict conditions.  We reject these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not err by exercising his discretion to impose
    consecutive rather than concurrent sentences.  The offences in this case,
    although committed on the same day and within approximately one hour of each
    other, constitute different offences against different complainants at different
    times.  The sentencing judge’s discretionary decision to impose consecutive
    sentences in these circumstances attracts deference from this court.  In
    our opinion, the global sentence imposed, fourteen months, was fit and does
    not offend the totality principle.  Accordingly, we see no basis for appellate
    interference on this ground.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge’s reasons indicate that he properly considered and rejected
    the appropriateness of a conditional sentence.  Although he did not expressly
    mention the appellant’s conduct on pre-trial bail when considering this issue,
    he concluded that the appellant’s lengthy and varied criminal record, which
    included several related offences, indicated that the appellant posed a substantial
    risk of reoffending.  This finding was amply supported by the evidential
    record.  The appellant’s criminal antecedents include convictions for break
    and enter and robbery, several convictions for failure to comply offences,
    and convictions for aggravated assault, sexual assault, possession of a weapon
    and possession for the purposes of trafficking.  Importantly, some of these
    offences were committed while the appellant was on parole or shortly after
    his release from jail after serving sentences on other offences.  In addition,
    the appellant’s pre-sentence report, to which the sentencing judge made extensive
    reference, stresses the appellant’s anti-social traits and a developed pattern
    of non-compliance.  Nothing in that report suggested that the appellant was
    amenable to community supervision with or without strict conditions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, in our view, the sentencing judge did not err by concluding
    that the imposition of a conditional sentence would endanger the safety of
    the community.  This conclusion foreclosed the possibility of a conditional
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we reject the appellant’s contention that the sentencing judge erred by failing
    to credit the appellant for pre-trial bail conditions amounting to house
    arrest.  At the sentencing hearing, neither counsel directly addressed the
    issue whether the appellant should receive credit for the conditions of his
    pre-trial bail.  Nonetheless, the sentencing judge expressly considered this
    issue in accordance with <i>R. v. Downes</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.).  Having
    considered the matter, he concluded that the record before him was insufficient
    to permit credit to be given for pre-trial release.  Apart from the evidence
    of the terms of the bail order, there was no evidence before the sentencing
    judge about the impact of the appellant’s bail terms.  By failing to provide
    the sentencing judge with sufficient information to properly assess the impact
    of his pre-trial bail, the appellant failed to meet his onus under <i>Downes</i>.  This
    ground of appeal, therefore, also fails.</p>

    the reasons given, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence appeal
    is dismissed.</p>
