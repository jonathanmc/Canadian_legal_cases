    appellants, Muhammad Arsal Khan and Kaneez Fatima, were jointly convicted
    of the murder of their five-year-old daughter following a trial before Watt
    J. sitting with a jury.  They appeal their convictions for first degree murder
    and second degree murder, respectively. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Fatima also seeks leave to appeal the fifteen-year minimum period of parole
    ineligibility imposed on her by the trial judge.  The appellants raise several
    grounds of appeal, some of which are particular to each appellant and some
    of which overlap.  We will address the grounds raised by Khan that are particular
    to him first before turning to the joint grounds of appeal, and finally to
    the grounds particular to

      raises three grounds of appeal that are particular to him, all of which

      our view, this was a case in which the jury could properly consider Khan's
      post- offence conduct in assessing whether Khan planned and deliberated
      the murder of his daughter. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>      In
      concluding that the post-offence conduct was admissible for this purpose,
      we note that there was also evidence of pre-offence conduct that the jury
      could look to in deciding whether the murder was planned and deliberate.
      In particular, while not exhaustive, we note the following body of pre-offence
      evidence: (i) evidence of Khan’s animus towards his daughter, in particular
      his obsessive belief that she was not his child; (ii) evidence that from
      birth, Khan had no involvement with his daughter until she was foisted
      on him by village elders following his divorce; (iii) evidence that Khan
      ordered surgical instruments from Pakistan, from which it could be reasonably
      be inferred that he planned to use them to dismember the child following
      her death (three of those instruments were found to be missing from the
      set when the police searched Khan’s apartment); (iv) evidence from which
      the jury could infer Khan’s pre-selection of at least one of the burial
      sites; (v) evidence from which the jury could infer that Khan took steps
      to isolate the child once in Canada, including his failure to list her
      as an occupant on their apartment lease; and (vi) evidence that Khan was
      involved in physical abuse of the child predating her death. </span></p>

      view of this evidence of pre-planning, in our view, the trial judge made
      no error in leaving the post-offence conduct with the jury as evidence
      from which the jury could infer planning and deliberation. </span>See <i>R.
      v. MacKinnon </i>(1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at paras. <span lang=FR-CA>14-15

    ); <i>R. v. Teske </i>(2005), 202 O.A.C. 239 at para. 85.  <span lang=EN-US>On
    the facts of this case, the post-offence conduct was compelling and it supported
    an inference of a pre-existing plan to cover up the murder. This evidence
    included: (i) evidence that the body was dismembered virtually immediately
    after the killing; (ii) evidence that the body parts were buried in several
    locations within a short period after the murder; (iii) evidence that the
    apartment where the child was murdered, as well as a backpack used to carry
    body parts, were cleaned meticulously; (iv) evidence that some of the surgical
    instruments were disposed of; (v) evidence that school authorities were falsely
    advised that the child had returned to Pakistan; (vi) evidence that Khan
    and Fatima moved to a new apartment soon after the murder; and (vii) evidence
    that Khan changed his physical appearance shortly after he killed the child,
    as he knew he had been observed burying some of the body parts in a nearby
    park.</span></p>

      for Khan’s contention that the verdict of first degree murder based on
      planning and deliberation is unreasonable, the evidence which we have recited
      above puts that submission to rest. In our view, there was ample evidence
      upon which the jury could find Khan guilty of first degree murder on the
      basis of planning and deliberation.</span></p>

      Khan maintains that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that
      it could find first degree murder based on unlawful confinement. We would
      not give effect to this ground of appeal. In our view, there was some evidence
      capable of showing that Khan beat the child into unconsciousness, such
      that she could not have escaped even if she had wanted to, and that he
      then obtained a knife which he used to kill her by slitting her throat.
      While there may be other scenarios on the evidence capable of supporting
      an inference of unlawful confinement not inherent in the killing itself,
      the scenario we have identified is sufficient to dispose of this ground. </span></p>

      appellants submit that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
      jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a standard of proof much closer
      to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities, as noted
      by Iacobucci J. in <i>R. v. Starr </i>(2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 544-45
      (S.C.C.). This court has already dealt with and rejected that submission
      several times: see <i>R. v. Samuels</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 403; <i>R.
      v. Archer</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60.  In this case, the instructions
      given by the trial judge were clear and we see no realistic possibility

      appellants submit that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant their
      request to circumscribe s. 473(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
      c. C-46, and have the case tried by a judge alone, absent the Crown’s consent,
      on the ground that they could not receive a fair trial as guaranteed by
      ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>if
      they were tried by a jury. In particular, the appellants submit that the
      trial judge applied too stringent a test in rejecting their request. The
      test applied by the trial judge was:</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[T]hat there is a real and substantial risk that the effect of adverse

      appellants submit that the correct test to be applied is one that is analogous
      to the test used in deciding whether a challenge for cause should be granted
      in any particular case. Specifically, the appellants contend that regardless
      of the position taken by the Crown, an accused should be entitled to trial
      by judge alone in any case where there exists a real possibility that the
      jury would be unable to render a fair and impartial verdict because of
      (i) bias or prejudice of a kind that would warrant a challenge for cause,
      or (ii) bias or prejudice occasioned by the nature of the charge and the
      evidence underlying it.</span></p>

      the facts of this case, the appellants contend that the prejudicial nature
      of the post-offence conduct was so severe as to preclude the jury’s rational
      assessment of the evidence. Combined with pre-trial publicity and potential
      religious and racial bias, they submit that there was a real possibility
      that they would not receive a fair trial if tried by a jury.</span></p>

      reject this submission. In s. 473(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, Parliament
      has made its intention clear that a person charged with murder, the most
      serious crime in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, is to be tried by a court composed
      of a judge and jury absent the consent of both parties. While this provision
      can be overridden in order to ensure an accused’s right to a fair trial,
      it should not be interfered with lightly.  </span></p>

      150, is dispositive of this ground of appeal. <i>Henderson</i> makes it
      clear that an accused seeking a judge alone trial in these circumstances
      must, at a minimum, meet the test required for a change of venue – a test
      the appellants concede is more stringent than the one they propose. On
      our view of the record, the appellants fall well short of meeting that

    that by failing to intercede, she became a party to Khan’s planned and deliberate
    murder. Accordingly, leaving first degree murder for the jury’s consideration

    Fatima’s submission that the trial judge erred in fixing the period of parole

    Fatima’s post-offence conduct was particularly heinous. Standing alone, it

    was clear and it reflected the community’s sense of horror and the need to
