style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this appeal and cross appeal, the parties challenge various aspects of the
    trial judge’s equalization payment, including certain of his findings regarding
    proper inclusions and deductions in that calculation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the appeal, the appellant wife asserts that the trial judge erred in his
    use of the sum of $42,000 as the value of her RRSPs as at the date of separation.  We
    agree.  Although there was no evidence before the trial judge establishing
    the actual value of the wife’s RRSPs on the date of separation (April 8,
    1994), there was clear evidence that as at March 31, 1994 and December 1994
    respectively, dates close in time to the valuation date, their value was
    approximately $38,200 on a pre-tax basis.  There was no evidential support
    for the trial judge’s figure of $42,000, although this was the valuation
    figure urged by the respondent’s counsel in his submissions at trial.  In
    these circumstances, the best evidence of the value of the appellant’s RRSPs
    as at the valuation date was $38,200.  Accordingly, this amount should be
    included in the appellant’s net family property statement for the purpose
    of equalization.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second issue on the appeal concerns the value of the husband’s pension.  The
    trial judge valued the husband’s pension on the basis that the parties had
    agreed to a certain figure.  This was an error.  The value to be attributed
    to the husband’s pension was a hotly contested matter.  In light of that
    error, it falls to this court to determine the value of the husband’s pension
    as at the valuation date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    best evidence before the trial judge of the value of the husband’s pension
    was the payout in 1998 when the husband’s employment was terminated.  At
    that time, the husband was given approximately $137,735 as the cash surrender
    value for his full pension entitlement.  The parties are agreed that seventy
    per cent of the pension accrued during the marriage and that the <i>pro rata</i> approach
    under <i>Best v. Best</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 868 applies.  Thus, seventy per
    cent of the sum of $137,735 is the figure that should be included in the
    husband’s net family property statement for the purpose of equalization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the cross-appeal, the appellant submits as a threshold issue that
    the cross-appeal should not be entertained by this court because the respondent
    is allegedly in arrears in his child support payments for the one remaining
    dependant child of the parties.  We decline to give effect to this argument
    in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    appears that the matter of the alleged arrears is an ongoing dispute.  Moreover,
    the appellant’s materials before this court on this issue were filed as fresh
    evidence only within the last several days, permitting little time for response
    by the respondent.  If arrears in child support are owed by the respondent,
    they should, of course, be paid forthwith.  However, on this record, we cannot
    be satisfied of the quantum and nature of such arrears or of the respondent’s
    history of payments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the merits of the cross-appeal, the respondent asserts that the trial judge
    erred by failing to afford him a deduction in the sum of $29,000 for his
    pre-marriage equity in the parties’
    first home, by allowing only a fifty per cent, rather than a one hundred
    per cent, deduction for his VISA and CIBC credit card bills on the date of
    separation, and by including as a deduction the aggregate amount of $2,000
    awarded to the respondent in two separate costs awards in this proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant conceded the costs and credit card issues and did not vigorously
    contest the remaining issue regarding the respondent’s claim for a deduction
    on account of his equity in the parties’
    first home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    are satisfied that the trial judge erred in respect of each of these items
    and that the relief sought by the respondent on the cross-appeal concerning
    these issues should be granted.  In respect of the respondent’s claim for
    a deduction on account of his equity position in the parties’ first home,
    we rely, in particular, on the decision of this court in <i>Nahatchewitz
    v. Nahatchewitz</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3154.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the appeal and cross-appeal are allowed in accordance with these
    reasons.  As success has been divided before this court, we make no award
    of costs in respect of these proceedings, as agreed by counsel.  In light
    of the appellant’s degree of success at trial given this decision, she is
    entitled to recover part of her trial costs, which we fix in the total sum
    of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
