  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from the dismissal of a certification motion under the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992, </i>S.O. 1992. c. 6 (“<i>CPA</i>”). The underlying
    claim involves foreign currency transactions conducted with credit cards
    issued by the respondent (defendant), the Toronto-Dominion Bank (“TD”). The
    central claim of the appellants (plaintiffs) is that TD breached its contract
    with the holders of its Visa credit cards by charging undisclosed and unauthorized
    fees in respect of those foreign currency transactions. Specifically, the
    plaintiffs allege that there are three components to the fees that TD charged
    its Visa cardholders for foreign currency transactions during the putative
    class periods and that two of these, a “conversion fee” and an “issuer fee”,
    were undisclosed and unauthorized under the terms of the relevant cardholder
    agreements.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 9, 2005, the motion judge, Cullity J., dismissed the motion to certify
    the action as a class proceeding under the <i>CPA</i>.  Based on the claim
    as pleaded by the plaintiffs, the motion judge held that certification would
    only be appropriate if compensatory damages could be determined on a class-wide
    basis.  Finding that damages could not be assessed in that manner, the motion
    judge concluded that the common issues requirement under s. 5(1)(c) of the <i>CPA</i> could
    not be met because the common issues he could identify were insignificant
    in the context of each class member’s claim as a whole.  This in turn led
    him to conclude that the action did not meet the preferable procedure requirement
    under s. 5(1)(d) of the <i>CPA</i>. Accordingly, he dismissed the motion
    for certification. The plaintiffs’ appeal to the

    my view, the motion judge’s analysis of the common issues and preferable
    procedure criteria in this case reflects an error of law that requires intervention
    by this court.  For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the orders of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff, Dr. Paul Cassano, was a TD Visa cardholder.  As with all other
    TD Visa customers, his card was issued pursuant to a standard cardholder
    agreement.  On October 11, 1994, Dr. Cassano used his Visa card to pay for
    hotel charges in New York in the amount of US$563.36.  On his TD Visa credit
    card statement, this amount was converted to CA$766.62.  The hotel mistakenly
    charged his card twice and so he was given a credit.  However, instead of
    being credited in the amount of CA$766.62, his credit card statement showed
    that he was credited with CA$745.44 for the second mistaken charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    <st1:date Year="1997" Day="12" Month="7" w:st="on">
    July 12, 1997, Dr. Cassano commenced a putative class proceeding relating
    to the difference between charges and credits for foreign currency transactions.  After
    some amendments to the statement of claim, including the addition of Dr.
    Benjamin Bordoff as a second plaintiff, the claim was refined and the plaintiffs
    now allege that TD’s undisclosed practice of incorporating a “conversion
    fee” and an “issuer fee” in respect of every foreign currency transaction
    during the proposed class periods was unauthorized by the terms of the relevant
    standard cardholder agreements between TD and its cardholders.  The amended
    claim was brought on behalf of a putative class of cardholders of both consumer
    and commercial credit cards. The plaintiffs seek judgment for the total amount
    of the unauthorized fees that TD collected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Foreign
    currency transactions are specifically addressed under the terms of the cardholder
    agreements in effect from time to time between TD and its cardholders.  The
    claim brought by Dr. Cassano is based on the terms of the 1991 cardholder
    agreement (“Cardholder Agreement”).  The pertinent provisions for the purposes
    of this appeal are as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Signature on, retention or use of any charge card
    issued … will confirm agreement between the Cardholder and The Toronto-Dominion
    Bank (the “Bank”) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>CARDHOLDER RESPONSIBILITY</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. a)     The Cardholder will pay to the Bank the
    Indebtedness, fees and all other charges in respect of the use of the Card
    ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ANNUAL FEE AND SERVICE FEES </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.         The Cardholder shall pay the Bank … [an] … annual
    fee for the Account ...  This annual fee is specified in the Disclosure Statement.
    The Cardholder shall also pay the Bank service fees for services provided
    by the Bank for the Account, the Card, or Twin Cheques, as shown in the Disclosure
    Statement or as notified to the Cardholder<i> </i>from time to time. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.       Foreign currency transactions are converted
    to Canadian dollars at the exchange rate determined by the Bank on the date
    when the Bank credits or debits each transaction to the Account. This rate
    may be different from the rate in effect on the date of the transaction. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14.       This Agreement and the information contained
    in the Disclosure Statement may be amended at any time by the Bank by giving
    notice in writing of the amendment to the Cardholder ... Use of the Card
    ... following notification of an amendment to this Agreement shall be deemed
    to be acceptance by the Cardholder of such amendment …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground between the parties that there were three components to
    the TD foreign exchange rate:</p>
  <p>i)         a
    “basic conversion rate” which was set daily by Visa International;</p>
  <p>ii)        an additional 1% “conversion fee”; and</p>
  <p>iii)       an
    “issuer fee” of 0.4% from 1987 to October 1994, 0.65% from November       1994
    to October 2002 and 1% thereafter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties disagree over whether the reference in paragraph 10 of the Cardholder
    Agreement to the “exchange rate determined by the Bank” is sufficiently broad
    to encompass all three components. The plaintiffs contend that it is not
    and that the conversion and issuer fee components represent undisclosed,
    and therefore unauthorized, fees in breach of the Cardholder Agreement. TD
    conversely asserts that the terms of the Cardholder Agreement provide a broad
    discretion to determine the exchange rate to be applied to foreign currency
    transactions. Therefore, TD submits that there is no requirement for additional
    disclosure relating to the components making up the foreign exchange rate,
    with the result that there was no breach of contract during the putative
    class periods.   In any event, TD claims that paragraph 5 of the Cardholder
    Agreement permits it to charge the conversion fee and issuer fee as “service
    fees”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    of September 1, 2001 and June 1, 2003 respectively, TD’s consumer and commercial
    cardholder agreements were amended to expressly include disclosure of the
    conversion fee and issuer fee as part of the currency exchange cost. </p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>THE REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the certification hearing, the motion judge considered whether the requirements
    for certifying a class action under s. 5(1) of the <i>CPA </i>were satisfied.  That
    provision states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. (1)  The court shall certify a class proceeding
    on a motion under section 2, 3 or 4 if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the pleadings or the notice of application
    discloses a cause of action;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) there is an identifiable class of two or more
    persons that would be represented by the representative plaintiff or defendant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the claims or defences of the class members
    raise common issues;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) a class proceeding would be the preferable
    procedure for the resolution of the common issues; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) there is a representative plaintiff or defendant
    who,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) would fairly and adequately represent the interests
    of the class,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) has produced a plan for the proceeding that
    sets out a workable method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class …,
    and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) does not have, on the common issues for the
    class, an interest in conflict with the interests of other class members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to s. 5(1)(a), the motion judge had considerable, and understandable,
    difficulty in identifying the legal basis for the plaintiffs’ claim. The
    original pleading asserted a claim based on unjust enrichment and a claim
    for an accounting.  At the certification hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs
    relied only on the defendant’s alleged breach of contract in charging unauthorized
    fees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that the claim - read broadly and taken together with
    the provisions of the terms of the Cardholder Agreement and disclosure statements
    - sounded in breach of contract, even though these words appeared nowhere
    in the pleading.  At para. 32 of his reasons, the motion judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court at trial might, however, think that the
    relevant question was whether there was an express or implied agreement that
    all fees charged would be disclosed. <i>It is, in my opinion, clear from
    the amendments made to the statement of claim that the alleged failure to
    disclose the service fees charged on foreign currency transactions is of
    the essence of the claim that they were unauthorized.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the requirement under s. 5(1)(b) that there be an identifiable class,
    the motion judge concluded that the proposed class definition was acceptable
    for certification purposes.  The proposed class is defined as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All holders of: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) consumer TD Visa cards of any category and
    type up to September 1, 2001; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) commercial TD Visa cards of any category and
    type up to June 1, 2003 </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>who incurred credits or debits on such cards as
    a result of foreign currency transactions.</p>
  <p>At para. 43 of his judgment, the motion judge noted that the definition “has
    the required rational connection with the claims pleaded and the proposed
    common issues.  It also employs objective criteria that, notwithstanding
    the size of the class, should enable class members to be identified, and
    to self-identify.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the common issues requirement under s. 5(1)(c), the plaintiffs
    proposed the following seven common issues:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 1 - Did TD charge
    its cardholders an unauthorized fee or fees when converting the debits and
    credits incurred in a foreign currency to Canadian dollars?  If so, when,
    why and what are the particulars?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 2 - If the answer
    to Question 1 is “Yes”, must TD account for the unauthorized fees?  If so,
    why and to whom?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 3 - Is TD liable in
    damages?  If so, why and to whom?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 4 - Should the damages
    for the class be assessed in the aggregate? If so, why, in what amount and
    how should the damages be distributed?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 5 - Is TD liable to
    pay punitive damages? If so, why and to whom? Should the punitive damages
    be assessed in the aggregate?  If so, why, in what amount and how should
    the punitive damages be distributed?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 6 - Should TD pay
    prejudgment and postjudgment interest?  If so, should interest be simple
    [or] compound, at what rate(s), on what amount(s) and why and how should
    the interest be distributed? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Issue 7 - Should TD pay
    the costs of administering and distributing any monetary judgment?  If so,
    why and what amount should TD pay?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found only Issue 1 to be acceptable. He accepted this issue
    because the resolution of it depended on the interpretation of the documents
    provided by TD to cardholders, which could be determined on a class-wide
    basis.  He rejected Issue 2 in light of the indication by the plaintiffs’ counsel
    at the certification motion that their client did not seek an accounting
    of profits or restitution damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge gave lengthy reasons, which are considered in detail below,
    for concluding that Issues 3 and 4 were not acceptable.  He found that the
    acceptance of Issue 3 would serve no purpose unless a claim for general compensatory
    damages for breach of contract is included in a certification order.  In
    the motion judge’s opinion, the court’s ability on a common issues trial
    to determine the amount of general compensatory damages depends on whether
    Issue 4 is acceptable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering Issue 4, the motion judge asked whether it was possible to make
    an aggregate assessment of the defendant’s liability as contemplated by s.
    24(1) of the <i>CPA</i>.  This provision states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24. (1)  The court may determine the aggregate
    or a part of a defendant’s liability to class members and give judgment accordingly
    where,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) monetary relief is claimed on behalf of some

    54 O.R. (3d) 520 (Div. Ct.), (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 22 (C.A.), leave to appeal
    to S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 106, for the proposition that “a question<span
style='color:black'> relating to an aggregate assessment should not be included
    if, at the certification stage, the court can determine that one or more
    of the three preconditions [in s. 24(1)] could not be satisfied even if the
    other common issues were decided in favour of the plaintiff at trial</span>.”<span
style='color:black'>  The motion judge concluded that s. 24(1)(c) could not be
    satisfied because the determination of the extent of each cardholder’s loss
    would require proof on an individual basis of how each member of the class
    would have used his or her Visa card had he or she known of the fees that
    applied to foreign currency transactions.  The motion judge thus rejected
    Issue 4 on the basis that there were no means by which to determine the defendant’s
    liability to any of the class members without proof on an individual basis. </span></p>

    for Issue 5, the motion judge found that there was the requisite minimum
    factual basis for including the issue of punitive damages in a certification
    order. However, he found that the determination of punitive damages required
    a consideration of compensatory damages, which he had rejected as a common
    issue. Ultimately, he concluded at para. 79 of his judgment that “[t]he effect
    of my refusal to include the claim for compensatory damages in the certification
    order is that neither liability for, nor the amount of, any such damages
    will be determined in these proceedings. In these circumstances, I do not
    see how the issue of punitive damages can properly be certified.”  </p>

    regard to the preferable procedure requirement in s. 5(1)(d), the motion
    judge concluded that the resolution of the single issue he had identified
    as being potentially suitable for certification - whether there was a breach
    of contract - would not advance the claims of the class members significantly
    for the reason that compensatory damages would have to be determined on an
    individual basis, and therefore, could not be managed efficiently on a class-wide

  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>

    motion judge is an experienced class action judge.  His decision is entitled
    to substantial deference: see <i>Markson v. MBNA Canada Bank</i> (2007),
    85 O.R. (3d) 321 at para. 33 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. requested,
    [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 346.  The intervention of this court should be limited
    to matters of general principle: see <i>Cloud v. Canada (A.G.) </i>(2004),

    and (b) of the <i>CPA</i> are satisfied in this case.  However, for the reasons
    as set out below, I do not agree with his analysis of the common issues requirement
    or the preferable procedure requirement under ss. 5(1)(c) and (d). </p>
  <h3>(i)  Common issues and the breach of contract claim under s. 5(1)(c)</h3>

    motion judge held that Issue 1 raised an acceptable common issue of whether
    there was a breach of contract.  He observed that the resolution of this
    question depended on the interpretation of the documents provided by TD to
    cardholders, which is a question that could be determined on a class-wide
    basis.  I agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that this common issue
    is acceptable.</p>

    assessment of cardholder behaviour to quantify damages </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge engaged in a lengthy consideration of how the nature of the
    breach of contract in this case might impact on the manner in which damages
    would be calculated.  In fairness to the motion judge’s analysis of the damages
    issue, he was left to consider the matter in the context of the pleading
    as it stood at the outset of the certification motion, which was not altered
    to clearly reflect the contractual basis for the plaintiffs’ claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge requested further submissions from plaintiffs’ counsel regarding
    whether they were seeking compensatory or restitutionary damages for breach
    of contract.  Compensatory damages are the normal remedy in breach of contract
    cases and reflect the amount required to put the plaintiff, so far as money
    can do it, in the same situation as if the contract had been performed.  In
    contrast, restitutionary damages are a discretionary remedy intended to disgorge
    the defendant of benefits received from his or her breach of contract.  Restitutionary
    damages, which are measured by the defendant’s gain, may be awarded in a
    case where the plaintiff has suffered no loss, or where the plaintiff’s loss
    is less than the defendant’s gain:  see<i> Blake v. Attorney-General</i>,
    [2001] A.C. 268 (H.L.) and <i>Bank of America Canada v. Mutual Trust Co.</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 601.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the plaintiffs took the position that it was immaterial whether compensatory
    or restitutionary damages were awarded for breach of contract in this case
    because the amounts would be the same, namely, the aggregate amount of the
    unauthorized fees collected by TD.  In oral argument before the motion judge,
    plaintiffs’ counsel indicated that he did not intend to seek an award of
    restitutionary damages because this was not a case where compensatory damages
    would be inadequate, which is a prerequisite for an award of restitutionary
    damages.  The motion judge therefore proceeded on the basis that the remedies
    sought in the action did not include restitutionary damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    motion judge then considered whether compensatory damages could be calculated
    on an aggregate basis. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that compensatory
    damages could be determined on a class-wide basis because the measure of
    compensatory damages is simply the amount of the unauthorized fees collected
    by TD.  In contrast, counsel for the defendant submitted that the measure
    of compensatory damages is the amount that would place cardholders in the
    same situation as if disclosure of the unauthorized fees had been made.  In
    order to determine whether losses had been incurred, it would be necessary
    to make an individual inquiry of each cardholder as to whether they would
    have behaved any differently if the fees had been disclosed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the defendant’s position was correct.  His reasoning
    is noted at paras. 55-7 of his judgment:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The agreement between the Bank and cardholders
    differs from other contractual arrangements in that the Bank has a right
    to determine what charges will be made without the agreement of the other
    contracting parties. They, however, are under no compulsion to use the cards.
    What they have lost if fees are not disclosed - and if this is contractually
    required - is the freedom to choose whether to use the cards and to pay the
    fees. The flaw in the reasoning of plaintiff's counsel is, in my opinion,
    that it ignores the elements of choice that are inherent in the alleged terms
    of the contract between the parties. It treats the contract as if it imposed
    an absolute prohibition on charging the impugned fees. If it had done this,
    the measure of damages might well have been the amount of the fees. But if
    - as is the case on the interpretation of the plaintiff's pleading that I
    have accepted - the claim is that the breach consisted of charging the fees
    without prior disclosure, then the damages for which the defendant would
    be liable must put the cardholders in the same situation as if disclosure
    had been made. As Scrutton L.J. stated in <i>Withers v. General Theatre Corp.</i>,
    [1933] 2 K.B. 536 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at pages 548-9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now where a defendant has alternative ways of performing
    a contract at his option, there is a well-settled rule as to how the damages
    for breach of such a contract are to be assessed. ... The damages are assessed
    ... on the basis that the defendant will perform the contract in a way most
    beneficial to himself and not in the way that is most beneficial to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In short, as the Bank would have been entitled
    to charge additional fees if these had been disclosed, the value that cardholders
    would have received if disclosure had been made, and the measure of the loss
    suffered by each of them, was the value of the choice that each was deprived
    of - the opportunity to decide whether to use a TD card and pay the additional
    fees for the purpose of foreign currency transactions, or to do otherwise.
    I accept the submission of defendant's counsel that this value could only
    be determined on an individual basis.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Cardholders whose behaviour would not have been
    affected by the non-disclosure suffered no loss.  Some cardholders might
    have ceased to use the card if they had known that fees were included in
    the exchange rate.  Some might have continued to use the card, but less frequently,
    and the behaviour of others may have been unaffected by the disclosure.  It
    cannot even be assumed that any of the cardholders would have behaved any
    differently.  Without an individual determination, there would be no way
    of knowing how many fell into each of these categories or the aggregate loss
    for those, if any, who would have refrained from using – or limited their
    use of – the card.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  In
    my view, the motion judge fell into error in concluding that the damages
    assessment flowing from the alleged breach of contract in this case would
    require an individual assessment of cardholder behaviour.  In arriving at
    this conclusion, the motion judge relied on the approach to assessing damages
    that applies in cases where the defendant repudiates a contract that has
    alternative modes of performance.  The governing principle in this type of
    case is that a defendant is entitled to have damages assessed on the basis
    that the defendant will perform the contract in the way that is most beneficial
    to himself and not in the way that is most beneficial to the plaintiff.  That
    principle was first explained by Scrutton L.J. in <i>Withers v. General Theatre
    Corp.</i>, [1933] 2 K.B. 536 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  It was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hamilton v. Open
    Window Bakery, </i>[2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at paras. 13-23 as a general principle
    for determining damages in cases where a defendant who wrongfully repudiated
    a contract had alternative modes of performing the contract<i>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am of the view that this principle for assessing damages has no application
    to the case at bar because the defendant did not have alternative modes of
    performing the contract in the sense contemplated in <i>Withers</i> and <i>Open
    Window Bakery</i>.   In <i>Withers</i>, Scrutton L.J. gave helpful examples
    of when this principle for assessing damages would apply at p. 549: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. undertakes to sell to B. 800 to 1200 tons of
    a certain commodity;  he does not supply B. with any commodity.  On what
    basis are the damages to be fixed?  They are fixed in this way.  A. would
    perform his contract if he supplied 800 tons, and the damages must therefore
    be assessed on the basis that he has not supplied 800 tons, and not on the
    basis that he has not supplied 1200 tons, not on the basis that he has not
    supplied the average, 1000 tons, and not on the basis that he might reasonably
    be expected, whatever the contract was, to supply more than 800 tons.  The
    damages are assessed…on the basis that the defendant will perform the contract
    in the way most beneficial to himself and not in the way that is most beneficial
    to the plaintiff. </p>
  <p>And further:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Consider] a lease for seven, fourteen or twenty-one
    years which is wrongfully determined at the end of five years by the landlord.  On
    what basis are damages to be assessed?  Answer:  On the basis that the landlord
    can determine the lease in seven years, and therefore the plaintiff can only
    recover damages on the assumption that he had only two more years of the
    lease to run.</p>
  <p>Evidently, in both these examples, the contract explicitly provided the
    defendant with different modes of performance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Open
      Window Bakery</i>, the plaintiff contracted to provide services to the
      defendant for 36 months.  The contract provided the defendant with a right
      to end the contract after 18 months, upon giving three months’ notice of
      the intent to terminate.  The defendant wrongfully terminated the contract
      after 15 months.  The trial judge awarded damages reflecting what would
      have happened if the defendant had not breached its contractual obligations
      and concluded that the defendant would not have terminated at the earliest
      opportunity.  He awarded damages reflecting the plaintiff’s claim for 36-months’ salary,
      less a discount of 25%, which reflected the possibility that the defendant
      might have validly exercised its right to terminate the contract with notice
      at some later point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority of this court, with reasons reported at (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 767,
    overturned the trial judge’s award.  Simmons J.A. for the majority held that,
    regardless of what the defendant might have done if the breach had not occurred,
    damages must be based on the minimum obligation of the defendant, that is,
    compliance with the early termination clause.  She reduced the damages award
    accordingly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada unanimously upheld the majority’s decision. Arbour
    J., writing for the court, stated at paras. 19-20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge erred in this case in engaging
    in a tort-like inquiry as to what would have happened if OWB [the defendant]
    had not breached its contractual obligations to Hamilton [the plaintiff],
    and in concluding that OWB would not have terminated at the earliest opportunity.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The assessment of damages required only a determination
    of the minimum performance the plaintiff was entitled to under the contract, <i>i.e</i>.,
    the performance which was least burdensome for the defendant. The plaintiff
    agreed at the outset that she was entitled to no more by contracting for
    a contractual term that could be truncated with notice entirely at the discretion
    of the defendant.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the terms of the Cardholder Agreement do not provide alternative
    modes of performance that are in any way analogous to those considered in <i>Withers</i> and <i>Open
    Window Bakery</i>.  The terms of the Cardholder Agreement do provide the
    defendant with an option of disclosing fees and amending the agreement.  They
    do not, however, provide the defendant with an option of presenting cardholders
    with a hypothetical choice of asking what they would have done in the event
    that disclosure of certain fees had been made retroactively in accordance
    with the terms of the Cardholder Agreement.  The motion judge fashioned such
    an option, and in so doing, he engaged in the tort-like approach to assessing
    damages that was adopted by the trial judge in <i>Open Window Bakery</i> and
    rejected by the majority of this court and by the Supreme Court of Canada<i>.</i>  In
    other words, the motion judge asked what would have happened if the defendant
    had not breached its contractual obligations, rather than asking whether
    the defendant had alternative means of complying with its existing contractual
    obligations.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I do not accept the motion judge’s conclusion that a determination of compensatory
    damages in this case is an unmanageable prospect because of a need to assess
    how individual cardholders would have behaved had they known of the allegedly
    undisclosed fees.  Reading his reasons in their entirety, it is clear that
    this error informed his ultimate conclusion that this action was not appropriate
    for certification as a class proceeding. </p>

    on a review of the evidence, that it is appropriate to conduct an aggregate
    assessment of monetary relief under s. 24 of the <i>CPA</i>, as was contemplated
    by this court in <i>Markson</i>,<i> supra</i>.  Alternatively, even if the
    trial judge were to conclude that an aggregate assessment of damages is inappropriate,
    the nature of the claim asserted is such that the provisions of the <i>CPA</i> might
    well be utilized so as to make a class proceeding under the statute the “preferable

    rate of interest was imposed by the bank where a cardholder engaged in a

    a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure for pursuing the common
    issues that remained.  The motion judge was of the view that factual investigations
    would be required to identify those cardholders who had in fact paid interest
    at a criminal rate and the amount they paid in excess of that rate.  He reasoned
    that it would be necessary to examine millions of transactions individually
    in order to make such findings and concluded that the expense of this exercise
    would far exceed the benefit to the individual class members.  The majority

    paras. 44-45, Rosenberg J.A. wrote the following about s. 24(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…I agree with Cullity J. in <i>Vezina v. Loblaw
      Companies Ltd.</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1974 at para. 25 (S.C.J.) that at the
      certification stage the plaintiff need only establish that “there is a
      reasonable likelihood that the preconditions in section 24(1) of the <i>CPA</i> would
      be satisfied and an aggregate assessment made if the plaintiffs are otherwise
      successful at a trial for common issues.” </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, conditions (a) and (c) pose no difficulty.  With
    respect to (a), monetary relief is claimed on behalf of the class. As to
    condition (c), statistical sampling – as provided in s. 23 – can be employed
    to determine the aggregate or part of the defendant’s liability without proof
    of individual claims.  Thus, this condition is also satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    in <i>Markson</i>, in this case, condition (a) presents no difficulty.  Monetary
    relief is claimed on behalf of the class.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is a “reasonable likelihood” that condition (c) would also
    be satisfied.  For the reasons given above, establishing the extent of TD’s
    liability does not require making individual inquiries of cardholders to
    determine what they would have done if they had known of the fees.  Rather,
    the aggregate of TD’s liability may reasonably be expected to be capable
    of proof by resort to TD’s records of the amount of fee income it collected
    during the relevant time frame.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    date, counsel for TD have refused to provide such a figure or confirm whether
    one exists.  On an answer to a question taken under advisement on the cross-examination
    of the TD’s representative, Mr. Geoffrey Butler, - “[t]o advise of the fees
    earned on foreign exchange transactions by the bank during the period from
    1968 going forward” - counsel for TD stated that this amount is “[n]ot relevant.
    TD will not argue that the fees collected are less than the amount to prosecute
    the litigation.”  This non-response does not provide an evidentiary basis
    for concluding that the aggregate of the defendant’s liability cannot be
    assessed without proof by individual class members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Condition
    (b) remains to be considered.  In <i>Markson</i>, Rosenberg J.A. concluded
    that this condition is satisfied where potential liability can be established
    on a class-wide basis, but entitlement to monetary relief may depend on individual
    assessments.  In the present case, if a finding were made that there had
    been a breach of contract in relation to the charging of the fees, there
    would be no
    “questions of fact or law other than those relating to the assessment of
    monetary relief” remaining to be determined.  The finding that there had
    been a breach of contract would make all such fees improper. Accordingly,
    the only assessment necessary would be to quantify the amount of the fees
    charged. That falls squarely within the contemplation of 24(1)(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the only argument offered by TD on the motion below, and on this appeal,
    related not to the inapplicability of s. 24(1)(b) but rather to the costs
    associated with determining quantum by checking individual records. Mr. Butler
    deposed that the defendant retained copies of individual cardholder’s statements
    from January 1985 to June 1998 on microfiche, which can be reviewed manually.  Since
    June 1998, statement information is recorded both electronically and on microfiche.  TD
    does not therefore argue that no relevant information is available, or that
    such inquiry would relate to anything other than the assessment of monetary
    relief, but rather that the costs associated with reviewing the records and
    determining the amounts charged to each individual cardholder would be significant.  Mr.
    Butler has estimated that it would take 1500 people about one year to identify
    and record the foreign exchange transactions on the cardholder statements
    that are available only on microfiche and that this would cost about $48,500,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    economic argument advanced by TD ignores the fact that the damages calculation
    would only be necessary if TD is found to have breached the contract with
    its cardholders. Therefore, the essence of TD’s argument is that the recovery
    phase of the litigation, subsequent to a finding of liability, will cause
    it to incur significant expense. It would hardly be sound policy to permit
    a defendant to retain a gain made from a breach of contract because the defendant
    estimates its costs of calculating the amount of the gain to be substantial.
    A principal purpose of the <i>CPA </i>is to facilitate recovery by plaintiffs
    in circumstances where otherwise meritorious claims are not economically
    viable to pursue. To give any effect to the economic argument advanced by
    TD here would be to pervert the policy underpinning the statute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    a similar economic argument was rejected by Rosenberg J.A. in <i>Markson</i>.  His
    reasons at paras. 48-51 are instructive in this situation: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 24(3) … contemplates that an aggregate
    award will be appropriate notwithstanding that identifying the individual
    class members entitled to damages and determining the amount cannot be done
    except on a case-by-case basis, which may be impractical or inefficient.  Condition
    (b) must be interpreted accordingly.  In my view, condition (b) is satisfied
    where potential liability can be established on a class-wide basis, but entitlement
    to monetary relief may depend on individual assessments.  Or, in the words
    of s. 24(1)(b), where the only questions of fact or law that remain to be
    determined concern assessment of monetary relief.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An example of such an award is found in <i>Gilbert
      v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 4260 (S.C.J.).  In
      that case, on consent, Winkler J. certified a class proceeding and approved
      a settlement.  The defendant CIBC was alleged to have charged undisclosed
      and unauthorized fees or charges in relation to foreign currency transactions
      on VISA accounts.  The members of the class were defined as all persons
      in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    issued one or more CIBC VISA cards on or before a certain date.  There was
    apparently no attempt to identify those members of the class who had actually
    used their VISA cards to conduct transactions in foreign currency.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Gilbert</i>, CIBC agreed to pay $16.5 million
    to settle the claims.  Slightly less than $14 million was to be paid directly
    to class members in amounts ranging from 72 cents to $14.32.  As Winkler
    J. observed at para. 15 these amounts were arbitrary and “[did] not purport
    to compensate class members in terms of actual amounts owing nor [did] they
    compensate only class members with valid claims”.  It would have been too
    costly and time consuming to determine liability and amount on an individual
    basis.  Moreover, like in this case, in <i>Gilbert</i>, records were not
    available for a significant portion of the period in question.  But, as Winkler
    J. said, at para. 15, “The <i>CPA </i>anticipates such a problem in s. 24(2)
    and (3) which provide that the court may order that an award be applied so
    that individual class members share in an award on an average or proportional
    basis and that the court shall consider whether it would be impractical or
    inefficient to identify class members entitled to share in the award or exact
    shares in making such a determination.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    too in this case, the trial judge may find it possible to resort to ss. 24(2)
    and (3) of the <i>CPA</i> in order to fashion a remedial order that avoids
    potential costs and inefficiencies that might arise from an attempt to determine
    the quantum of damages on an individual basis.  Further, the class here is
    more limited than in <i>Gilbert </i>or <i>Markson</i> in that it does not
    include all TD Visa cardholders, but only those who used their cards for
    foreign currency transactions.  In this case, the effect of the restrictive
    definition of the class, combined with the common issue of breach of contract,
    is that if the common issues judge decides that the imposition of the allegedly
    undisclosed fees was a breach of contract, then the defendant’s liability
    will extend to each member of the plaintiff class.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    in the event that a trial judge were not prepared to rely on ss. 24(2) and
    (3) to fashion a remedial order in this case, I note that the combined operation
    of ss. 24(4), (5) and (6) of the <i>CPA</i> authorize the court to require
    that class members submit individual claims in order to give effect to an
    aggregate award of damages.  These provisions state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24(4) When the court orders that all or a part
    of an award under subsection (1) be divided among individual class members,
    the court shall determine whether individual claims need to be made to give
    effect to the order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) Where the court determines under subsection
    (4) that individual claims need to be made, the court shall specify procedures
    for determining the claims.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)  In specifying procedures under subsection
    (5), the court shall minimize the burden on class members and, for the purpose,
    the court may authorize,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the use of standardized proof of claim forms;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the receipt of affidavit or other documentary
    evidence; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the auditing of claims on a sampling or other
    basis.</p>
  <p>The court thus has at its disposal mechanisms for receiving individual claims
    in order to give effect to an aggregate damages award in a case where the
    quantification of damages turns on an assessment of documentary, rather than
    testimonial, evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, in my view, the question of whether the damages can be assessed
    on an aggregate basis raises an acceptable common issue. </p>
  <h3>(iii)   Preferable procedure and s. 5(1)(d) </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s conclusion that a class proceeding is not the preferable procedure
    flowed from his interpretation of the contract and his finding that it would
    be necessary to conduct individual examinations of class members to ascertain
    their subjective reaction to the undisclosed fees, as well as how, if at
    all, their credit card use would have been affected by their knowledge of
    these fees.   In view of my conclusion that individual assessments of cardholder
    behaviour are not required to determine the extent of liability in this case,
    a class proceeding is clearly the preferable procedure, particularly where
    an aggregate assessment of damages under s. 24 is possible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am of the view, however, that even if the common issues judge were to determine
    that it is not appropriate to award aggregate damages in this case, a class
    action is still the preferable procedure in light of the governing principles
    that apply to the preferable procedure inquiry under s. 5(1)(d).   These
    principles, which were articulated  by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hollick,</i> <i>supra</i>,
    were summarized in <i>Markson</i> at para. 69:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)  The preferability inquiry should be conducted
    through the lens of the three principal advantages of a class proceeding:
    judicial economy, access to justice and behaviour modification;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) &quot;Preferable&quot; is to be construed broadly
    and is meant to capture the two ideas of whether the class proceeding would
    be a fair, efficient and manageable method of advancing the claim and whether
    a class proceeding would be preferable to other procedures such as joinder,
    test cases, consolidation and any other means of resolving the dispute; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)  The preferability determination must be made
    by looking at the common issues in context, meaning, the importance of the
    common issues must be taken into account in relation to the claims as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the first two of these principles, the court must consider judicial
    economy and the institutional capacity of the courts to efficiently address
    a matter of this potential size.  It must also consider access to justice
    and the availability of any other remedial process to the putative class
    members.  And finally, the court must consider the questions of general deterrence
    and accountability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that this is a case much like <i>Markson</i>, where Rosenberg
    J.A., at para. 5, concluded that a class proceeding “is not only the preferable
    procedure, but also the only viable procedure for remedying the alleged wrong
    and calling the alleged wrongdoers to account.”  The relatively small amounts
    of money that are likely to be at stake in individual claims and the disproportionately
    high costs associated with litigating claims on an individual basis overwhelmingly
    favour a class proceeding:  see <i>Markson</i> at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third principle requires that the preferability determination be made by
    looking at the common issues in relation to the claim as a whole.  The claim
    as a whole includes any individual issues as well as the common issues.  The
    scheme of the <i>CPA, </i>which is a procedural statute, provides for the
    resolution of common issues and any individual issues that remain.  The statute
    also provides for the assessment of damages on an individual or aggregate
    basis, as well as a series of options for the distribution of individual
    and aggregate damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the resolution by the court of the common issue of whether
    there was a breach of contract is highly significant in relation to the other
    issues raised in this action.  Both the defendant and the potential class
    members have an obvious interest in the determination of whether the fees
    charged for the foreign currency transactions were in breach of the relevant
    cardholder agreements.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although much of the focus of the argument on the motion below and the appeal
    in this court focused on the provisions of the <i>CPA</i> that permit an
    aggregate assessment of damages, it must be noted that the certification
    decision does not necessarily turn on whether damages can be assessed on
    an aggregate basis.  Indeed, assessing damages on an aggregate basis is usually
    the exception to the general rule in class proceedings, in that it is akin
    to determining the whole of the litigation through the common issues trial.  While
    the common issues trial is obviously an essential component of a class proceeding,
    it is not the whole of the proceeding.  The statute is a powerful procedural
    mechanism that permits the court to take a variety of approaches in resolving
    the claims of class members.<span style='background:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin
    C.J.C. in <i>Hollick</i>, <i>supra</i>, was alive to the fact that class
    actions typically call for a resolution of both common and individual issues.  In
    addressing the preferable procedure requirement in s. 5(1)(d) of the <i>CPA</i>,
    the Chief Justice noted that the wording of s. 5(1)(d) calls for a determination
    as to whether “a class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the
    resolution of the common issues.”  However, as she observed at para. 29,
    there will often be more to a class proceeding than the resolution of the
    common issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The Act itself, of course, requires
      only that a class action be the preferable procedure for &quot;the resolution
      of the common issues&quot; … and not that a class action be the preferable
      procedure for the resolution of the class members' claims. I would not
      place undue weight, however, on the fact that the Act uses the phrase &quot;resolution
      of the common issues&quot; rather than
    &quot;resolution of class members' claims&quot;. As one commentator writes:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>The [American] class action [rule]
      requires that the class action be the superior method to resolve the &quot;controversy.&quot; The
      B.C. and Ontario Acts require that the class proceeding be the preferable
      procedure for the resolution of the &quot;common issues&quot; (as opposed
      to the entire controversy). [This] distinctio[n] can be seen as creating
      a lower threshold for certification in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and B.C. than in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    <i>However, it is still important in B.C. and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario to assess the litigation as a whole, including the individual hearing
    stage, in order to determine whether the class action is the preferable means
    of resolving the common issues. </i>In the abstract, common issues are always
    best resolved in a common proceeding. However, it is important to adopt a
    practical cost-benefit approach to this procedural issue, and to consider
    the impact of a class proceeding on class members, the defendants, and the
    court.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>See Branch, <i>supra</i>, at para.
      4.690 [W.K. Branch, <i>Class Actions in Canada</i> (Vancouver:  Western
      Legal Publications, 1996)]. I would endorse that approach.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is sometimes overlooked in the focus on the common issues at the certification
    stage is that the <i>CPA</i> includes provisions permitting the use of modified
    procedures for conducting individual assessments of damages. The thrust of
    these provisions is to ensure that the court has the means to conduct cost-effective
    and timely determinations of individual issues following the common issues
    trial.  As a result, the fact that damages may not be amenable to aggregate
    assessment at the conclusion of a common issues trial is not fatal to certification
    of a class proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the resolution of individual issues is an essential element of many class
    proceedings and is crucial if there is to be an advancement of the goal of
    access to justice.  Put another way, although the prospect of an aggregate
    assessment of damages is a factor in favour of certification, it is not a
    prerequisite.  An action may well be certified as a class proceeding even
    in cases where individual assessments of damages in small amounts may be
    necessary.  Absent this possibility, the purposes of the <i>CPA</i> would
    be seriously eroded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    what is called for in addressing the preferable procedure requirement is
    to look not just at the common issues trial, but at the other procedural
    options for conducting the class action litigation pursuant to the <i>CPA.</i>  In
    this regard, I note that s. 25 of the <i>CPA</i> confers broad jurisdiction
    on the common issues trial judge to fashion procedures to be followed where,
    among other things, damages cannot be assessed in the aggregate.  This section
    deals specifically with individual participation in a class proceeding following
    a favourable determination on the common issues. Under its various subsections,
    the common issues trial judge has, <i>inter alia</i>, the authority to: direct
    a further trial (s. 25(1)(a));  appoint “one or more persons to conduct a
    reference” (s. 25(1)(b)); and give directions on the procedures to be followed
    (s. 25(2)).  The broad jurisdiction of the common issues judge is amplified
    by s. 25(3), which provides that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>25. (3) In giving directions under [s. 25(2)],
    the court shall choose the least expensive and most expeditious method of
    determining the issues that is consistent with justice to the class members
    and the parties, and in so doing, the court may,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) dispense with any procedural step that it considers
    unnecessary; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) authorize any special procedural steps, including
    steps relating to discovery, and any special rules, including rules relating
    to admission of evidence and means of proof, that it considers appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case at bar, the key issue raised by the plaintiffs’ claim is whether
    there was a breach of contract on the part of TD.  If the trial judge finds
    that there was no breach, the litigation will be concluded. On the other
    hand, if TD is found to have breached its contract with its cardholders,
    the trial judge may determine that damages can be assessed either in the
    aggregate or on an individual basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the individual approach to assessing damages is deemed to be appropriate,
    the assessment should still be straightforward and cost-effective. Given
    my rejection of the need for extensive inquiries of each cardholder as contemplated
    by the motion judge, in the event that there is a finding favourable to the
    class members on the breach of contract issue, all that remains is a relatively
    straightforward accounting exercise that can be accomplished either by the
    class members providing their credit card statements or by the defendant
    producing its records to show the amount of any charges and the individuals
    to whom any amounts owing should be paid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CPA</i> also
    provides a range of options for distributing amounts awarded under ss. 24
    or 25.  For example, s. 26(2)(a) permits the court to require the defendant
    to distribute monetary relief directly to class members “by any means authorized
    by the court, including abatement and credit”.  I draw particular attention
    to s. 26(3), which states: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>26. (3) In deciding whether to make an order under
    clause (2)(a), the court shall consider whether distribution by the defendant
    is the most practical way of distributing the award for any reason, <i>including
    the fact that the amount of monetary relief to which each class member is
    entitled can be determined from the records of the defendant.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
    the <i>CPA </i>provides a procedural mechanism on which the trial judge could
    rely to distribute amounts awarded under either s. 24 or s. 25.  Thus, in
    my view, the preferable procedure requirement is satisfied in this case regardless
    of whether the assessment and distribution of damages, if necessary, are
    to be conducted on an aggregate or individual basis.       </p>
  <h3>(iv)  Representative plaintiff and litigation plan requirement under s.
    5(1)(e)</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the remaining certification requirements in s. 5(1)(e), there was nothing
    before this court to indicate that the adequacy of the proposed representative
    plaintiffs or their litigation plan was being seriously challenged.  I would
    not expect that there will be any serious issue relating to s. 5(1)(e) of
    the <i>CPA</i>, but to comport with the statute, the requirements found in
    this provision must be addressed in the certification order.   </p>
  <h3>(v)  Recasting of the common issues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, it is my view that the action is appropriate for certification
    as a class proceeding. However, the common issues as framed by the plaintiffs
    must be recast:  see <i>Kumar v. Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada</i> (2003),
    226 D.L.R. (4th) 112 at paras. 30-4 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was some discussion during argument as to whether it was appropriate to refer
    to possible defences among the list of common issues.  In my view, it is
    generally only appropriate to include such defences as common issues when
    they rise to the level of making a subclass necessary under s. 5(2) of the <i>CPA. </i> Otherwise,
    setting out defences as common issues has the inherent risk of compromising
    the defendant’s position at the common issues trial. Common issues are not
    intended to supplant pleadings.  Moreover, the defendant at the common issues
    trial will unquestionably raise the defences that are also common by way
    of response to the allegations contained in the common issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would frame the common issues as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 1 - Was TD in breach of the standard Cardholder
    Agreement by charging cardholders the conversion fee and issuer fee in respect
    of foreign currency transactions during the class period?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 2 - If so, are there compensatory damages? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 3 - Can the amount of compensatory damages,
    if any, be determined on an aggregate basis?  If so, what is the amount of
    damages and how should they be distributed?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 4 - Is TD liable to pay punitive damages?
    Should the punitive damages be assessed in the aggregate?  If so, in what
    amount and how should punitive damages be distributed?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 5 – If questions 1-3 are answered in the
    affirmative, should TD pay prejudgment and postjudgment interest?  If so,
    in what amounts?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue 6 - Should TD pay the costs of administering
    and distributing any monetary judgment?  If so why and in what amount?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Divisional Court and
    the motion judge, and substitute an order granting the motion for certification
    on terms that are consistent with these reasons.  </p>
