    Minister of Finance for Ontario appeals from the order of the application
    judge, Belobaba J., declaring that Proctor and Gamble Inc. (“P&amp;G”) is
    exempt, under s.&nbsp;7(1)41 of the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c.R. 31 (the “Act”) from paying retail sales tax on wooden pallets it rents
    and then employs in the shipment of its commercial goods to large-scale retailers.
    Section 7(1)41 of the Act reads in part as follows:</p>

    pallets do not qualify as “returnable containers” as that term is defined
    in s.&nbsp;1(1) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at that conclusion, the application judge outlined in some detail
    the uncontradicted evidence pertaining to P&amp;G’s business and the use
    it makes of pallets in the sale of its commercial goods to large-scale retailers.
    The salient features of that evidence are repeated below.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>P&amp;G’s
      business and its use of pallets</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G
    is engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of various consumer
    products, including toiletries, household cleansers, baby and feminine care
    products, and food and beverages. P&amp;G sells these products to high-volume
    retailers such as Costco, Wal-Mart, Loblaws, and Canadian Tire. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    P&amp;G ships commercial goods to its customers, it packages the goods in
    boxes and stacks the boxes on the flat wooden pallets that measure 48 inches
    by 40 inches. P&amp;G then wraps the entire package, including the pallet,
    with an industrial-strength plastic stretch wrap. Because the pallets are
    basically flat wooden platforms, they can only be used to ship the consumer
    goods to customers once they have been attached to the consumer goods with
    the plastic stretch wrap. It is this unit (referred to by P&amp;G as a “palletized
    product”) that P&amp;G sells to its customers. Some customers, such as Costco,
    place the pallets with P&amp;G’s product directly onto their sales floors,
    as part of a marketing technique that enables consumers to access the product
    more efficiently and with greater savings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P&amp;G
    rents the pallets it needs from CHEP Canada Inc. and CHEP invoices P&amp;G.
    P&amp;G’s customers do not pay CHEP for the pallets, nor are they responsible
    for returning the pallets to CHEP once they have been unloaded. Instead,
    CHEP arranges for the pallets to be picked up from their business premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    CHEP retrieves the pallets, it cleans, repairs, and stockpiles them for re-use.
    When P&amp;G places a new order for pallets from CHEP, the orders are filled
    from a pool of generic CHEP pallets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the years, CHEP pallets, with their easy four-sided access for fork-lifts
    and hand-jacks, have become the preferred method for packaging and shipping
    large orders to many retailers. Indeed, many of P&amp;G’s customers now require
    that P&amp;G use only CHEP pallets in their shipments. Finally, while P&amp;G
    does not charge its large-scale customers directly for their use of the pallets,
    the rental costs paid by P&amp;G to CHEP are included in the price P&amp;G
    charges for its product.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Findings
      made by the application judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    that factual backdrop, the application judge made two critical findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he found that the transfer of the pallets from P&amp;G to its customers constitutes
    a “sale” as that term is defined under the Act. In so concluding, he observed
    that “sale” is defined in s. 1(1) of the Act as including “any transfer of
    possession … whereby at a price or other consideration a person delivers
    to another person tangible personal property.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister has never disputed that P&amp;G transfers possession of the pallets
    to its customers. The contentious issue before the application judge was
    whether it received “consideration” for doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge resolved that issue in favour of P&amp;G. At para. 36 of
    his reasons, he made the following finding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I agree … that
    consideration for the pallets does pass from P&amp;G’s customers to P&amp;G
    because the evidence is that the rental charges for the pallets are included
    in the price. Something of value, however minimal, is therefore given to
    P&amp;G by its customers for their receipt and use of the pallets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge elaborated on that finding at para. 37 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>One must also
    remember that the products that P&amp;G’s customers purchase are not just
    the Consumer Goods, but a palletized (and plastic wrapped) shipment of Consumer
    Goods .… In accordance with the expectations of P&amp;G’s customers who insist
    on a palletized package, the Consumer Goods are sold together with and attached
    to the pallets. Hence, it makes sense that the packaging material, i.e.,
    the pallets and the plastic stretch wrap, would be included in the cost of
    the Consumer Goods. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 38, the application judge finalized this aspect of his analysis as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he transfer
    of the pallets to its [P&amp;G’s] customers is a “sale” because consideration
    is provided by the customers in the overall price that is charged for the
    Consumer Goods and that includes the cost of the pallet rental.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second
    (and as an adjunct to the first finding), the application judge found that
    the CHEP pallets used by P&amp;G were not to be considered in isolation but
    as part of a homogeneous package—pallet, product, and stretch wrap—that P&amp;G
    was marketing to its large-scale customers. That finding, repeated time and
    again throughout his reasons, was central to his conclusion that the pallets
    come within the exemption in s.&nbsp;7(1)41 of the Act.  Two examples are
    found at paras. 54 and 56 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>54. The product
    that is being sold to the large-store customers, as already noted, is a palletized
    and plastic-wrap package of consumer goods. The pallet is an <i>essential
    part of the package being sold</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>56. A pallet-less
    shipping package with just the Consumer Goods and the plastic wrap <i>would
    not be a marketable product</i> given that P&amp;G’s customers have made
    clear that they prefer, even require, a palletized product. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that finding in place, the application judge had little difficulty concluding
    that the pallets are “attached to” or
    “incorporated into” P&amp;G’s product for purposes of s.&nbsp;7(1)41. At
    para. 59, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he final
    product that P&amp;G sells to Costco or Loblaws is a “palletized product” where
    the pallet is “attached to” the Consumer Goods by plastic stretch wrap. Or,
    putting it differently, the pallet is “incorporated into” a final palletized
    product, i.e. a pallet of P&amp;G Consumer Goods secured by plastic stretch
    wrap.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 67, the application judge summarized his findings and conclusions as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To sum up—the
    pallets are “attached to” the Consumer Goods or “incorporated into” a final
    palletized product consisting of the pallet, the Consumer Goods and the plastic
    stretch wrap. Either way, I am satisfied that P&amp;G comes within the exemption
    in s. 7(1)41.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    made those findings, the only remaining question was whether the pallets
    qualified as “returnable containers” so as to preclude P&amp;G from claiming
    the exemption created by s. 7(1)41. For reasons that need not be detailed,
    the application judge found that they did not and the Minister takes no issue
    with that finding on appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Minister’s Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister submits that the application judge erred in declaring that P&amp;G
    is exempt from paying Retail Sales Tax on the pallets under s. 7(1)41.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister submits that the pallets form no part of the product that P&amp;G
    actually sells to its customers. P&amp;G does not own the pallets and therefore
    it has no right to sell them. Moreover, the customers pay nothing for them.
    It follows, according to the Minister, that the application judge erred in
    two respects: first, in concluding that the pallets are “attached to” P&amp;G’s
    product, or alternatively, that they are
    “incorporated into” a final product; and second, that the pallets form part
    of P&amp;G’s product “for the purpose of sale”. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At

    we are satisfied that it was open to the application judge to find that P&amp;G’s
    customers paid some consideration for the pallets they received from P&amp;G.
    As such, he was entitled to conclude that the transfer of the pallets from
    P&amp;G to its customers constituted a
    “sale” under the Act. The Minister quarrels with that finding for two reasons. </p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Minister submits that P&amp;G does not own the pallets and therefore
    cannot pass title in them to their customers. That submission is true as
    far as it goes. It fails, however, to consider the more expansive definition
    of “sale” found in s. 1(1) of the Act. That definition, it is recalled, includes
    any transfer of possession of tangible property for consideration. And that
    is precisely what the application judge found to be the case here. As indicated,
    we are satisfied that that finding was open to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Minister submits that there was no “sale”
    here because the so-called “consideration” paid by P&amp;G’s customers for
    the pallets is simply an overhead expense, not unlike lighting and heating
    expenses, that P&amp;G builds into the final price it charges to its customers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the Minister’s submission is misconceived. It fails to recognize
    that under the Act, a “sale” requires more than mere consideration; it also
    requires the delivery of tangible personal property from one person to another. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, P&amp;G transfers possession of the pallets to its customers and
    recoups the cost of the pallets in the sale price. That constitutes a “sale”.
    The fact that P&amp;G may also recoup its heating and lighting costs is of
    no moment since it obviously does not transfer heat or lighting to its customers.
    Hence, those and other like overhead expenses cannot constitute a “sale” under
    the Act. Viewed that way, the Minister’s concern about opening floodgates
    as a result of adopting P&amp;G’s proposed interpretation is unfounded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we are satisfied that it was open to the application judge to find that the
    product P&amp;G sells is a palletized “package”, consisting of a stretch-wrapped
    pallet stacked with consumer goods. P&amp;G provided evidence to that effect
    and we find nothing remarkable about it. The phenomenon of the “big-box” store
    is upon us, and new and flexible marketing techniques are being employed
    to accommodate their needs. As the application judge so aptly put it at para.
    56 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A pallet-less
    shipping package with just the Consumer Goods and the plastic wrap <i>would
    not be a marketable product</i> given that <span class=headingNUMBERChar>P&amp;G</span>’s
    customers have made it clear that they prefer, even require, a palletized
    product. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the legislature contemplated such marketing techniques when it drafted the
    Act, we do not know. The record is silent in that regard. If the legislature
    did intend to tax the materials employed in these techniques—such as CHEP’s
    pallets—the Act falls short of the mark. If the legislature did not contemplate
    the techniques, then the Act can be amended to meet the realities of modern-day
    marketing and consumer demands.  In the meantime, as indicated, we see no
    basis for interfering with the application judge’s characterization of the
    final product marketed by P&amp;G as a “palletized” product.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we are on the subject of the wording of the Act, we note that s. 7(1)41 is
    not worded in the clearest of terms. Recall that this provision states: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Tangible
      personal property</i> purchased for the purpose of being processed, fabricated
      or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into <i>tangible personal
      property for the purpose of sale</i>. [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Both sides assumed that the phrase “for the purpose of sale”
    referred to the section’s first mention of “tangible personal property” (i.e.
    the pallets by themselves). Grammatically speaking, “for the purpose of sale”
    should modify a verb (or a series of verbs). Therefore, it could be read
    to modify “being processed, fabricated or manufactured into, attached to,
    or incorporated”. Although we do not need to finally decide the matter, under
    this interpretation of s. 7(1)41, the words “for the purpose of sale” would
    modify the section’s second mention of “tangible personal property” (i.e.
    the consumer goods or palletized product).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be
    that as it may, it seems to us that the Minister’s real concern here is that
    unlike the plastic stretch wrap—which the Minister does not seek to tax—the
    pallets pose a problem because they are not being discarded after they have
    served their purpose; rather, they are being recycled and re-leased by their
    owner CHEP. As such, they do not qualify as “returnable containers” under
    the Act and therefore, are not captured by the returnable container exception
    to the s. 7(1)41 exemption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunate
    though that may be from the Minister’s perspective, it can easily be rectified
    by amendment should the legislature see fit to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, for the reasons of the application judge, with which we are in
    substantial agreement, as augmented by these reasons, we would dismiss the
    appeal. The cross-appeal is dismissed as abandoned without costs.</p>
