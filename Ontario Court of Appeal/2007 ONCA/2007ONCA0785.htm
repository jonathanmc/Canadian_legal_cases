  <p>GILLESE J.A.:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> These
    parties have been involved in lengthy litigation over a partnership among
    family members to develop a property in York Region. The appellants are some
    but not all of the defendants in this action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants made a number of offers to settle, none of which were accepted
    by the respondent.  In September of 2004, the appellants made a further offer
    to settle the action (the “2004 offer”). They offered the respondent a 20%
    interest in the property in return for his consent to the dismissal of the
    action as against them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    2004 offer stated that it would “remain irrevocable until one minute after
    the commencement of the trial of this action.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2006, the respondent made some inquiries about the 2004 offer.  Shortly
    thereafter, the appellants instructed their lawyer to revoke the 2004 offer
    and make a new, less favourable, offer to settle.  The 2006 offer expressly
    revoked the 2004 offer. The respondent replied that the 2004 offer could
    not be revoked and that the 2004 offer was accepted. The respondent then
    brought a motion under Rule 49.09 to enforce the 2004 offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge held that the settlement should be enforced.  He stated that
    a restrictive reading of Rule 49.04(1) - which provides that “an offer to
    settle may be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted by serving written
    notice of withdrawal of the offer …” – would permit withdrawal of the 2004
    offer at any time before acceptance.  However, based on Rule 1.04 and policy
    considerations, he rejected that interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    1.04 provides that the Rules of Civil Procedure should be “liberally construed
    to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of
    every civil proceeding on its merits.”  Rule 1.04, coupled with the policy
    of the court to encourage settlements, led the motions judge to conclude
    that Rule 49.04(1) should be interpreted as being subject to an irrevocability
    provision in an offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge also found that the respondent had taken steps towards accepting
    the 2004 offer before the appellants tried to revoke it.  As a result, he
    found that the respondent could not be said to be “snapping up” a revoked
    offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge erred in his interpretation of Rule 49.04(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure is a self-contained scheme that deals
    with the manner in which offers are made, accepted and withdrawn.  In light
    of the clear language of Rule 49.04(1), I see no need to resort to Rule 1.04
    when interpreting it.  Rule 49.04(1) expressly provides that “an offer to
    settle” may be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted by serving written
    notice of withdrawal of the offer on the party to whom the offer was made.  The
    2004 offer was an offer to settle.  As the 2004 offer had not been accepted
    at the time that the 2006 offer was made and the 2006 offer complied with
    the requirements of Rule 49.04(1), the appellants were entitled to withdraw
    the 2004 offer despite the fact that it was stated to be irrevocable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting the practical implications that follow if R. 49.04(1) is
    not afforded its plain meaning.  For example, as counsel for the respondent
    concedes, had the 2004 offer been stated to have been “open” – rather than
    “irrevocable” - until one minute after the commencement of trial, the appellants
    would have been entitled to withdraw the 2004 offer pursuant to Rule 49.04(1).  There
    is little difference between an offer that is to remain open until one minute
    after trial commences versus one that is to be irrevocable until one minute
    after trial commences.  In both cases, the intention is that the offer is
    to remain open until one minute after the trial commences.  I do not favour
    an interpretation of R. 49.04(1) which permits the withdrawal of the offer
    in the former situation but precludes withdrawal of the offer in the latter.  Giving
    R. 49.04(1) its plain meaning, namely, that an offer to settle may be withdrawn
    at any time before acceptance provided that written notice of the withdrawal
    is served, precludes such inconsistency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    concluded that pursuant to Rule 49.04(1) the appellants were entitled to
    revoke the 2004 offer, there is no need to address the alternative arguments
    raised on this appeal, namely, that the motions judge erred in the exercise
    of his discretion to enforce the settlement (see <i>Milios v. Zagos </i>(1998),
    38 O.R. 3(d) 218 (C.A.)) or in his determination that the respondent had
    not “snapped up” the offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and allow the action
    to continue.  The appellants are entitled to costs of the motion and the
    appeal, fixed at $11,500 and $7,500, respectively.  These costs are inclusive
    of disbursements and GST. </p>
