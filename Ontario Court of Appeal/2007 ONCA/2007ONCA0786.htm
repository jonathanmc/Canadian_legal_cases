    Chicago police arrested nineteen-year-old Joseph Pannell for the attempted
    murder of a police officer.  He was eventually released on bail, but breached

    <st1:City w:st="on">

    Toronto as a reference librarian.  Recently, the police re-opened the case
    and were able to locate Pannell in

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States of America</st1:country-region>
    now seeks Pannell’s extradition.  Justice Watt ordered that Pannell be committed
    for extradition and the Minister of Justice ordered that he be surrendered
    to the

      <st1:place

    return Pannell to the United States after thirty years of quiet, peaceful
    living in this country may appear to some as harsh and may seem to exact
    an onerous and unfair penalty on his wife and children.  Indeed, the record
    is filled with letters of support attesting to Pannell’s good character since
    he has lived in
    <st1:country-region

    the appellant does not resist extradition on those grounds.  Rather, he mounts
    a series of legal arguments, principally based on the sufficiency of the
    prosecution case and concerns that, as an African-American male charged with
    attempting to kill a Chicago police officer, he cannot receive a fair trial
    in what he says is a racially-charged criminal justice system.  He submits
    that the extradition judge and the Minister made errors that require that
    the committal order be overturned and the surrender order quashed.  For the
    following reasons, I would dismiss both the appeal and the application for
    judicial review.</p>

    record before the extradition judge included a Record of the Case and a Supplemental
    Record of the Case.  In short, the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    says that there exists evidence that on March 7, 1969, the appellant shot
    Officer Terrence Knox several times when the officer attempted to question
    him outside a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago high school.  Two civilian witnesses saw the shooting and will testify
    that they followed the appellant as he ran from the scene.  They pointed
    the appellant out to another officer, and later identified the appellant
    while he was in custody in the back of a police car.  A third civilian witness
    also saw the shooting and later identified the appellant as the shooter when
    he was returned to the scene by police.</p>

    claims in the Supplemental Record of the Case, however, that it can prove
    that this weapon was used to shoot Officer Knox.  It also claims to be able
    to prove that at the time of his arrest, this weapon was “recovered from
    [the appellant’s] person”.  How it will do so, in view of the deaths of the
    arresting officers, is unexplained.</p>

    appellant raises the following issues on his appeal from the order of the
    extradition judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>1.         The extradition judge misapprehended his role in view of the
    decision in <i>United States of America v. Ferras; United States of American
    v. Latty</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>2.         The Record of the Case and the Supplemental Record of the Case
    do not make out a sufficient case for extradition.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>3.         The extradition judge erred in refusing to permit the appellant
    to attempt to impeach the Record of the Case and the Supplemental Record
    of the Case by calling Officer Knox and the certifying State’s Attorney.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his factum, the appellant also submitted that the extradition judge erred
    in failing to consider the appellant’s defence of self-defence.  He did not
    pursue that issue before this court; the appellant’s counsel concedes that
    while the Supreme Court may have broadened the judge’s role at an extradition
    hearing, it is not so broad as to permit consideration of possible defences.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant has identified three issues, they all to some extent revolve
    around the two different versions of events provided by Officer Knox.  The
    first version is set out in an undated, unsigned victim impact statement
    that was used by the authorities to obtain a provisional arrest warrant in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in July 2004.  The second version is an account of the expected testimony
    of Officer Knox as contained in the October 2004 Supplemental Record of the
    Case.  The appellant argues that these two versions of events are “grossly
    inconsistent” and that as a result, Knox’s evidence is an unreliable basis
    upon which to make an extradition order.  The appellant submits that what
    remains of the case is so deficient that it cannot support committal.  Further,
    he argues that the failure of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    to include the victim impact statement in the Record of the Case or the Supplemental
    Record of the Case was misconduct of such a degree that it could potentially
    undermine the validity of the certification.  He submits that the extradition
    judge erred in refusing to allow him to investigate this misconduct by calling
    Knox and the certifying State’s Attorney.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant attributes no blame to the extradition judge for these errors,
    because the extradition judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court’s
    recent decision in <i>Ferras</i> which he says has altered the role of extradition
    judges.  The appellant submits that <i>Ferras</i> has dramatically enhanced
    the judge’s role by requiring the judge to consider the reliability as well
    as the sufficiency of the evidence.  The appellant particularly relies on
    a passage from para. 54 of <i>Ferras</i>, where the court held that “[i]f
    the evidence is so defective or appears so unreliable that the judge concludes
    it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict, then the case should not go to
    a jury and is therefore not sufficient to meet the test for committal”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    so much of the appellant’s appeal is based on the purported conflict between
    Officer Knox’s two versions of events, I now turn to those versions. The
    appellant says the important discrepancies are as follows:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>            1.         The number of
    shots</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the victim impact statement, Officer Knox says that the appellant “pulled
    out a gun and fired about 13 shots … Three bullets smashed into my right
    arm.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the Record of the Case, Officer Knox is expected to testify that the appellant
    fired “numerous gunshots at him.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the Supplemental Record of the Case, Officer Knox is expected to testify
    that the appellant “fired five shots at him” and that he “returned fire with
    six shots”; the appellant then “fired two more shots at Knox”.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>            2.         Officer Knox’s location at the time of
    the shooting</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the victim impact statement, Officer Knox says that the appellant fired the
    shots “through the window and door of the fully marked squad car.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Record of the Case does not indicate where Officer Knox says he was when
    he was shot, but the civilian witnesses are expected to testify that he was
    beginning to use his police radio in his squad car when the appellant shot
    him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the Supplemental Record of the Case, Officer Knox is expected to testify
    that he initially “exited the car and told [the appellant] not to move” and
    that Officer Knox then “moved toward the police radio located inside the
    car to call for assistance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    dealing with the legal significance of these various statements, it is important
    to examine the alleged inconsistencies.  In my view, on close examination,
    there is no serious inconsistency as to Officer Knox’s location at the time
    of the shooting.  He was shot through the window and door of the squad car,
    according to the victim impact statement.  He was reaching for the police
    radio inside the squad car according to the civilian witnesses’ version and
    Officer Knox’s own version in the Supplemental Record of the Case.  I see
    no inconsistency in these versions.  On all three versions, some part of
    his body must have been inside the car when he was shot.  I do not accept
    the appellant’s submission that on the victim impact statement version he
    was inside the car, and on the Supplemental Record of the Case version he
    was outside the car.  I certainly do not accept the submission that these
    are grossly divergent accounts.  If Officer Knox’s evidence is so unreliable
    as to be discarded, it must be because of the inconsistency in the number
    of shots.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt about the inconsistency in the accounts of the number of shots
    fired by the appellant.  Interestingly, the total number of shots involved
    in the altercation has remained constant.  The victim impact statement stated
    that there were thirteen shots, but all fired by the appellant.  The Supplemental
    Record of the Case stated that there were seven shots fired by the appellant
    plus six shots fired by Officer Knox.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What,
    then, is the legal significance of this single inconsistency in Officer Knox’s
    account of the events?  The extradition judge thought it had no legal significance
    because of the limited role of an extradition judge.  As he said at para.
    72 of his reasons, “there is no independent reliability requirement for the
    Record of the Case, and an assessment of reliability lies beyond the reach
    of an extradition hearing judge.”  I agree with the appellant that in light
    of <i>Ferras</i>, this statement understates the judge’s role.  The appellant
    submits that since the extradition judge misapprehended his role, the case
    must be sent back for a new hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree with that submission.  Even under <i>Ferras</i>, the reliability
    inquiry is highly circumscribed.  The court described the inquiry in these

    my view, it is open to this court to examine the paper record, in light of
    the <i>Ferras</i> test, to at least see whether the reliability argument
    is a viable one.  In my view, it is not.  Officer Knox’s expected testimony
    as set out in the Record of the Case and the Supplemental Record of the Case,
    even when measured against the victim impact statement, possesses sufficient
    indicia of reliability that it was worthy of consideration.  In considering
    this issue, the court cannot be confined to the single inconsistency about
    the number of shots.  Threshold reliability requires the court to look at
    all of Officer Knox’s proposed testimony.  There can be no question that
    this testimony contains ample indicia of reliability, as set out below:</p>

    Knox’s explanation for wanting to talk to the appellant is consistent in

    it is apparent that Officer Knox is giving a first-hand account of a traumatic,
    life-threatening event that happened to him.  There is nothing to suggest
    that his ability to recall and relate the events was impaired through alcohol
    or drugs or because of lack of opportunity to observe.  Given those indicia
    of reliability, the single inconsistency as to the actual number of shots
    fired by the appellant is not capable of so undermining the reliability of
    Officer Knox’s testimony that it should be discarded.  There is therefore
    no reason to refer the matter back for a rehearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the sufficiency of the evidence, the appellant submits that the eye-witness
    identification evidence from Officer Knox and all three of the civilian witnesses
    is fraught with frailties.  He points out that all of the civilian witnesses
    identified the appellant when he was returned to the scene in the custody
    of the arresting officers.  He points to the apparent gaps in the evidence
    because of the deaths of the arresting officers, namely, whether the person
    arrested was the person pointed out to police by the civilian witnesses and
    whether the gun associated with the shooting was in the appellant’s possession.  As
    is so often the case, the prosecution case has not improved with age, especially
    with the passage of nearly forty years.  However, the evidence is not so
    defective or unreliable that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict.  While
    there is no suggestion that any of the witnesses, including Officer Knox,
    previously knew the appellant, this is also not a case where identification
    was made under circumstances of a fleeting glance.  Officer Knox had ample
    opportunity to observe his assailant and two of the civilian witnesses followed
    the shooter from the scene and pointed him out to the arresting officers.  </p>

    there is the powerful circumstantial evidence relating to the gun.  Obviously,
    the state will not be able to rely on first-hand accounts of the recovery
    of the weapon to link it to the appellant.  But, it says that it can show
    the appellant was in possession of the weapon.  Perhaps it can do so through
    admissible hearsay evidence or other circumstantial evidence.  It is not
    for the extradition judge to subject the Supplemental Record of the Case
    to minute examination through the lens of our rules of evidence.</p>

    appellant’s final argument turns on the alleged misconduct of the requesting
    state in failing to include the victim impact statement in the Record of
    the Case.  The appellant submits that he should have been allowed to challenge
    the certification by the State’s Attorney by calling evidence, including
    calling the certifying State’s Attorney and even Officer Knox.  The extradition
    judge refused to embark on this inquiry.  The appellant submits that the
    extradition judge erred because the presumption of reliability accorded to
    the Record of the Case depends upon the certifying authority exercising the
    utmost diligence and care.  Accordingly, the non-disclosure of the victim
    impact statement in the Record of the Case provides a basis for inquiring
    into the reliability of the certification.  The appellant relies upon the
    reasoning of Stromberg-Stein J. in <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and
    Northern Ireland v. Tarantino</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 284 (B.C.S.C.)
    where at para. 39 she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      certification process presumes and requires a reasonable degree of diligence
      and accuracy to ensure people are not extradited upon evidence which does
      not exist, and that court proceedings are not conducted and judgments reached
      on the basis of important assertions which have not been diligently examined
      and which are simply not accurate. This is not an unattainable goal for
      a certifying authority to achieve and reasonable diligence commensurate
      with the power is not too much to ask. It will be, one expects and hopes,
      a rare case where it is shown that a particular prosecuting official or
      authority has demonstrated, in their certification process, a lack of diligence
      and care resulting in proven important inaccurate assertions in successive
      records of the case. The case at bar is such a case, given the history
      of successive important inaccurate assertions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Tarantino</i> was
    an exceptional case.  The case for extradition turned on the evidence of
    three witnesses.  As the case progressed, the person sought to be extradited
    was able to demonstrate that the successive Records of the Case were replete
    with inaccuracies as to the whereabouts and availability of all three witnesses.  In
    the face of those inaccuracies, Stromberg-Stein J. held that it would be
    unsafe to rely upon the certifications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    that is not the situation in this case.  First, I reject the allegation of
    non-disclosure.  The victim impact statement was used to obtain the provisional
    warrant.  It was available to the appellant.  The requesting state is not
    required to include every possible piece of evidence in the Record of the
    Case.  Second, as I have shown, the victim impact statement is not so different
    from the facts as represented in the Record of the Case and the Supplemental
    Record of the Case as to cast doubt on the reliability of the certification.  Before
    he was entitled to embark on an attempt to undermine the presumed reliability
    of the Record of the Case, the appellant had to be able to show that there
    was a reasonable likelihood that the inquiry would assist in determining
    the matter before the extradition judge: see<i>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Anderson, supra </i>at paras. 40&#8722;41. The appellant failed to do so
    and the extradition judge was right not to embark on the proposed inquiry.</p>

    the application for judicial review, the appellant submits that the Minister
    of Justice erred in failing to find that his surrender would be unjust and
    oppressive having regard to the history of racial discrimination in Chicago,
    especially in the Chicago police force.  He also submits that the Minister
    erred in failing to find that the requesting state did not act in good faith.  </p>

    will deal with the appellant’s second argument first.  This argument turns
    on the various statements from Officer Knox.  In his response to the appellant’s
    submissions, the Minister stated that it was not his role “to re-assess the
    evidence or review the findings made by the extradition judge”.  The appellant
    submits that the Minister unduly constrained his powers and misapprehended
    the appellant’s arguments.  The appellant says that he was not asking the
    Minister to review the factual findings of the extradition judge, but rather
    to find that officials of the requesting state were negligent in certifying
    the case and had not acted in good faith because they failed to include the
    inconsistent victim impact statement in the Record of the Case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this submission.  First, it is not entirely clear
    that the Minister misapprehended the appellant’s argument.  In one of several
    submissions made to the Minister, the appellant’s counsel expressly raised
    the “numerous significant inconsistencies, omissions and contradictions” in
    the materials filed in support of the extradition request as a basis for
    refusing to surrender the appellant.  In any event, as noted above, the victim
    impact statement is not so inconsistent with the materials contained in the
    Record of the Case and the Supplementary Record of the Case as to call into
    question the extradition partner’s good faith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s other argument turns on the allegation that the Minister failed
    to properly address the issue of racial discrimination.  The appellant’s
    counsel provided a considerable amount of material to the Minister concerning
    racial discrimination in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago.  The appellant, who is black, is alleged to have shot a white police
    officer.  The appellant also says that someone, presumably a person associated
    with the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago police force, has falsely alleged that he was a member of the Black
    Panther Party.  He submits that the material provided to the Minister shows
    that he cannot get a fair trial in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chicago and that his physical safety will be at risk if he is returned to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago.  Accordingly, his surrender would infringe his right to fundamental
    justice under s. 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  In addition,
    the Minister should have refused extradition under s. 44(1) of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18.  For the purposes of this argument, I did not
    understand the appellant to suggest that there is any material difference
    between s. 7 and s. 44(1).  Section 44(1) provides as follows: </p>

      prong of the analysis requires a consideration of whether or not the appellant

    of view of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, the parties in this application appeared
    to agree that the same approach should apply to s. 44(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>.  The appellant submits that contrary to the holding of the Minister,
    he clearly made out a case at the first step.  He says that there was ample
    evidence that African-Americans are persecuted in the criminal justice system.  The
    appellant also submits that the Minister “asked himself the wrong question” when

    am not persuaded that the Minister made a reviewable error in his treatment
    of the first step of the <i>Hurley</i> test.  The materials submitted by
    the appellant to the Minister were summarized by the Minister as indicating
    continuing problems of racism in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    and as showing that the Chicago Police Department “is one that has had a
    troubling reputation for brutality in the past”.  But the Minister also noted
    that despite problems in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    justice system, and particularly in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago, the authorities had taken concrete steps to combat discrimination.  There
    were materials before the Minister to support that conclusion.  In any event,
    I am satisfied that the Minister did not err in concluding that the appellant

    in response to the appellant’s submissions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although I must

    been publicly identified with the Black Panther Party, and this false allegation
    together with the allegation that he had shot a white police officer put

    any possible misapprehension of the appellant’s position by the Minister,
    I am satisfied that he properly dealt with the appellant’s case.  He rightly
    took into account that on the two occasions that the appellant was held in
    custody in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago, there was no indication that he was harmed or mistreated in any
    way.  This was important information upon which the Minister could properly
    conclude that the appellant was not at risk, despite his subjective perception.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the allegation that he could not receive a fair trial, the Minister properly
    relied on the fact that the appellant had not suggested that he had been
    treated unfairly by state authorities before he fled.  As the Minister pointed
    out, he was granted bail on two occasions notwithstanding the seriousness
    of the charges and during a time which, according to the appellant, was “a
    very volatile and ugly period of racial violence” in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago.  Further, as pointed out by the Minister, the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    legal system is similar to ours and has substantial safeguards to ensure
    a fair trial.  Finally, as counsel for the Attorney General points out, the
    issue is not what conditions were like in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chicago in the 1970’s, but whether the appellant could receive a fair trial
    now.  I agree with counsel that the appellant failed to demonstrate that
    the Minister erred in finding that the appellant could receive a fair trial
    today.</p>
