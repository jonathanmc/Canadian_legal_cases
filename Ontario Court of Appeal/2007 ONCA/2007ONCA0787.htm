  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, who was adopted as a baby, wants to know the identity of her birth
    father.  She has tried to obtain this information through the disclosure
    provisions under the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C11 (the “<i>CFSA”</i>) but with no success.  The man named by her birth
    mother as her birth father denies paternity and refuses to consent to the
    disclosure of his name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant challenges the constitutional validity of the <i>CFSA</i>’s adoption
    disclosure provisions.  She also takes issue with s. 28 of the <i>Vital Statistics
    Act </i>(“<i>VSA</i>”), which allows for an adopted person’s original birth
    registration to be sealed and replaced with a new birth registration in accordance
    with the adoption order.  She submits that these provisions, which thwart
    her right to know who she is and where she came from, violate s. 7 and s.
    15 of the <i>Charter</i> and should be declared of no force and effect.  She
    also seeks an order allowing her access to information about her birth father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent defends the regime as the legislature’s attempt to balance two
    competing demands: a demand for access to information and a demand for protection
    of privacy.  Even among members of the “adoption triad” (<i>i.e.</i>, adopted
    persons, adoptive parents, and birth parents) there is a broad divergence
    of views on how the balance should be struck.  The application judge was
    correct, submits the respondent, in holding that the <i>CFSA</i>’s disclosure
    regime appropriately balances the competing demands and does not infringe
    the <i>Charter</i> rights of adopted persons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that Ms. Marchand only had standing to challenge ss.
    162-168 of the <i>CFSA</i> (and not ss. 161 and 170 – 174 of the <i>CFSA</i> or
    s. 28 of the <i>VSA</i>) and dismissed her application.  Frank J. held that
    there is no liberty right to obtain identifying information about a person
    who has expressly refused to consent to its disclosure.  She also held that
    the applicant had not been deprived of her security of person rights.  Even
    if her rights were infringed, the applicant had not identified any principle
    of fundamental justice implicated by the impugned provisions.  Finally, she
    concluded that there was no breach of the applicant’s s. 15 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Preliminary matter</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2005, the <i>Adoption Information Disclosure Act</i>, 2005, S.O.
    2005, c. 25 (“<i>AIDA</i>”), received royal assent.  The key provisions of <i>AIDA</i> were
    proclaimed into force on September 17, 2007.  <i>AIDA</i> amends the <i>VSA</i> and
    the <i>CFSA</i> by permitting adult adoptees to obtain uncertified copies
    of their original birth registrations and registered adoption orders and
    any original and substituted birth registrations of their adult birth children,
    subject to certain conditions.  An adopted adult or birth parent may file
    a
    “contact preference form” or a “no contact form”.  Birth parents and adopted
    adults may also apply to the Child and Family Services Review Board for an
    order prohibiting disclosure where, because of exceptional circumstances,
    the order is appropriate to prevent sexual harm or significant physical or
    emotional harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>AIDA</i> repeals
    every section of the <i>CFSA</i> challenged by the appellant with the exception
    of s. 161 [parent to be informed of adoption order], s. 162(1) and (3)(a)
    and (c) – (d) [persons who receive adoption order] and s. 165(5) [<i>Freedom
    of Information and Privacy Act</i> does not apply].  According to the official
    Table of Proclamations, all of <i>AIDA</i>’s provisions have now been proclaimed
    into force, with the exception of one (which has no relevance to this appeal).  The
    new regime has already been subject to constitutional challenge in the Superior
    Court.  In a decision released on September 19, 2007 Belobaba J. held that
    amendments to the <i>VSA</i> violated s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and were
    not saved by s. 1 and so were of no force and effect: <i>Cheskes v. Ontario
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 3515.  <i>AIDA</i>’s amendments to
    the <i>CFSA</i> were not challenged in <i>Cheskes</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the commencement of the hearing of this appeal, the panel raised the issue
    of  whether the appeal was moot in light of the proclamation of <i>AIDA</i>.  The
    appellant’s position was that the appeal was not moot.  Counsel for the respondent
    agreed on the basis that at least some of the relief sought by the appellant
    in her application – e.g. damages – required a determination of the validity
    of the <i>CFSA</i> when it was still in force.  We accepted this joint submission
    and agreed to hear the appeal on the merits.  As it turns out, later on the
    first day of the appeal hearing, the Ontario Government announced that it
    would not appeal the <i>Cheskes</i> decision.  Instead, it would introduce
    new legislation that “would let parents and children involved in past adoptions
    veto disclosure of information.”  (Globe and Mail, 14 November 2007, p. A8).  Since
    this announcement probably presages a return to something like the repealed <i>CFSA</i> scheme,
    it provides another reason for hearing this appeal on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Section 15</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal argument, developed comprehensively, was that the <i>CFSA</i> violated
    her equality right under s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that the <i>CFSA</i> scheme does not make stereotypical
    assumptions about the applicant or adopted persons generally.  The scheme
    regulates and limits the circumstances in which family information is made
    available to adopted persons based on the legislature’s assessment of how
    best to balance their needs against the competing needs of birth parents.   The
    scheme allows for access on an individualized basis against the backdrop
    of an assessment of the adoptee’s health, safety and welfare.  The application
    judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The challenged provisions are tailored to the needs
    of all members of the adoption triad and are a product of an attempt to balance
    those divergent needs with an individualized scheme.  I find that there is
    reasonable correspondence between the challenged provisions and the needs,
    capacities and circumstances of adopted persons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence does not support a finding that a
    reasonable person in the position of the applicant would conclude that the
    challenged disclosure provisions are demeaning to the claimant’s dignity.  This
    finding is inconsistent with a finding of discrimination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this analysis is sound.  The application judge’s review of the
    evidentiary record, including the positions of various experts in the adoption
    field, supports her analysis.  Moreover, her legal analysis is a fair application
    of the leading equality cases, especially <i>Law v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration</i>), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, whose
    framework she faithfully followed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Section 7</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second substantive argument is that the <i>CFSA</i> provisions
    violate her <i>Charter</i> s. 7 rights to liberty and security of the person.  The
    application judge held that the provisions did not infringe either of these
    rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is not necessary to pass judgment on the “liberty” and “security
    of the person” aspects of the application judge’s reasons.  That is because
    we agree with the application judge’s analysis and conclusion on the “principles
    of fundamental justice” component of the s. 7 analysis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A principle of fundamental justice must fulfil
    the following criteria:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    must be a legal principle that provides meaningful content for the s. 7 guarantee
    while avoiding adjudication of public policy matters;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    must be a significant societal consensus that the principle is “vital or
    fundamental to our societal notion of justice”; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle must be capable of being identified with precision and applied
    to situations in a manner that yields predictable results.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(See: <i>Canadian Foundation for Children</i> at
    paras. 8-11 and <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571 at para. 113.)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The unconditional disclosure of identifying personal
    information of third parties, even if they are birth parents of the claimant,
    without regard to the privacy and confidentiality interests of the persons
    identified and without regard to any serious harm that might result from
    disclosure, fails to meet the above criteria.  It is not a principle that
    is vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice.  It is instead
    a proposition of public policy that continues to be vigorously debated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contends that the application judge erred by concluding that
    the appellant did not have standing to challenge s. 28 of the <i>VSA</i> and
    ss. 161 and 170-174 of the <i>CFSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was not affected by the re-registration provisions of the <i>VSA</i> because
    her birth was not re-registered after her adoption.  As a result, her birth
    registration was not sealed and, in fact, she received a copy of it approximately
    eight months before the application hearing.  Accordingly, we can see no
    basis for interfering with the application judge’s assessment that the proper
    person to challenge s. 28 of the <i>VSA</i> would be someone directly affected
    by it.  Similarly, the appellant has not been denied information pursuant
    to several of the provisions of the <i>CFSA</i> and, therefore, we would
    not overturn the application judge’s exercise of discretion in not granting
    the appellant standing to challenge those provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant raises two issues for the first time on this appeal: the <i>CFSA</i> and <i>VSA</i> violate
    her freedom of conscience under s. 2(a) of the <i>Charter</i> and conflict
    with ss. 377 and 378 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  We see no merit in either
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  The respondent does not seek costs; accordingly, there
    will be no costs order.</p>
