  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of second degree murder following his trial by judge
    and jury. His primary ground of appeal is that the trial judge removed from
    the jury’s consideration the possibility of a verdict of acquittal. Rather,
    he instructed the jury that at a minimum, they must convict of manslaughter
    and that their sole task was to determine whether the Crown had proved second
    degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the closing addresses of counsel, the trial judge decided, after discussions
    with counsel, that there was no basis for an acquittal having regard to the
    evidence and the formal admissions made by the appellant, namely: (a) that
    he was at the scene; (b) that he was in possession of a firearm; and (c)
    that he discharged the firearm. In so concluding, he rejected defence counsel’s
    submission that there was a theoretical basis for an acquittal and that the
    matter should be left for the jury to decide. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    deciding to direct the jury that they could not acquit the appellant and
    that minimally, they must convict him of manslaughter, the learned trial
    judge did not have the benefit of two subsequent decisions from the Supreme
    Court of Canada in which the court made it clear that absent a formal admission
    of all of the essential elements of an offence, it is impermissible for a
    trial judge to direct a jury to convict. In <i>R. v. Gunning</i> (2005),
    196 C.C.C. (3d) 123 at para. 31, the court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Hence, it is
    never the function of the judge in a jury trial to assess the evidence and
    make a determination that the Crown has proven one or more of the essential
    elements of the offence and to direct the jury accordingly. It does not matter
    how obvious the judge may believe the answer to be.  Nor does it matter that
    the judge may be of the view that any other conclusion would be perverse.
    The trial judge may give an opinion on the matter when it is warranted, but
    never a direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in <i>R. v.  Kreiger</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 303 at para. 24, the court
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The overwhelming
    nature of the evidence can hardly justify a directed verdict of guilty. When,
    if not in such cases, would a verdict of guilty be directed? Would it be
    permitted whenever the evidence is overwhelming <i>in the eyes of the judges</i>?
    Under our Constitution, the plain answer to this last question is “no”. [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, we agree with the appellant that the three formal admissions did
    not amount to an admission of all of the essential elements of manslaughter
    that the Crown was required to prove. In particular, the appellant did not
    admit that he was a party to any offence committed by the other participants.
    In these circumstances, although the charge to the jury was otherwise fair
    and balanced, and although we agree that the prospects for an acquittal were
    remote at best, on the authorities we have cited, the appellant was deprived
    of his right to trial by jury and the proviso cannot cure the error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
