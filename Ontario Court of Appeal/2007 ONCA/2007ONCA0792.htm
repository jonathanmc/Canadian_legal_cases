    appellants 407922 Ontario Limited and Mr. Roberts seek to set aside the judgment
    of Justice McDermid dated May 26, 2006, granted against them as guarantors
    of a line of credit extended by the Bank of Montreal to an automobile dealership,
    Charterlease Corporation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ principal argument is that the trial judge erred in failing to
    hold that a forged Acknowledgement provided to the Bank on November 12, 1997,
    purportedly on their behalves, vitiated their earlier guarantees.  We would
    not give effect to this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    forged document was provided to the Bank apparently by another Charterlease
    shareholder, in support of a further personal advance by the Bank to that
    shareholder.  The appellants were admittedly unaware of it.  One and a half
    years later, however, when Charterlease arranged new and higher refinancing
    with the Bank, and the Bank required a new Acknowledgement that the appellants’ guarantees
    continued, Mr. Roberts freely and knowledgeably provided signed Acknowledgments
    on the appellants’ behalves on May 5 and 11, 1999.  Charterlease’s line of
    credit was then increased from the original amount of $230,000 (the original
    and continuing limits of the guarantees) to $850,000.  Chartelease was ultimately
    unable to fulfill its financial obligations to the Bank and other guarantors,
    including the plaintiffs, became responsible for the indebtedness to the
    Bank.  In this proceeding, they sought contribution against the defendants
    in that regard in their proportionate amount of the $ 230,000 liability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted that the Bank placed some reliance on the forged November
    1997 document, once it discovered in its file, although it had not requested
    the document in connection with the 1999 transaction.  He found however,
    that the Bank never sought to enforce the forged document or take any action
    on it and, accordingly, that the appellants had suffered no prejudice as
    a result of its being in the Bank’s possession.  He therefore concluded that
    the fraudulent document did not in law relieve the appellants from their
    obligations under their original guarantees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s findings in this respect
    and we find no error in his legal conclusion based upon them.  Nor are we
    persuaded that there was any material change in the Charterlease loan at
    the time of the forged document, as it was provided with respect to an increase
    in the other shareholder’s personal loan as noted above.  Accordingly, the
    guarantees cannot be said to have been discharged on that basis either.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we see no merit in the appellants’ submissions, not advanced strenuously
    before us: </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    Charterlease’s breach of its obligation to pay Mr. Roberts $500 per month
    and provide a leased car in exchange for the continued guarantee, absolved
    him from his obligations under that guarantee to the Bank and,</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> that
    his lack of independent legal advice at the time of the May 1999 transaction
    had the same effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Mr. Roberts deliberately chose not to terminate
    his guarantee for fear of triggering instant liability and in the hope that
    Charterlease would prosper and that his guarantee could later be discharged.  He
    knew what he was doing.  The fact that Charterlease ultimately defaulted
    on the $500 payments and the car lease did not vitiate the obligations to
    the Bank under the guarantee.  Mr. Roberts had access to independent legal
    advice but chose not to obtain it in May 1999.  He did receive some advice
    from a lawyer at the time of that transaction.  The trial judge found, as
    he was entitled to do, that independent legal advice was not required in
    the circumstances.</p>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
