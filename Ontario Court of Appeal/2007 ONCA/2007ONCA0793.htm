  <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals his convictions for trafficking in a controlled substance,
    possession for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of property obtained
    by crime on the grounds that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    and improperly admitted hearsay evidence.  This appeal mainly examines the
    relationship between the traditional exception to the hearsay rule of a co-conspirator’s
    declaration and the more modern principled exception to hearsay evidence.  </p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    late October and early November 2002, the police conducted three undercover
    drug purchases.  Shortly after the completion of the third drug purchase,
    a search warrant was executed on an apartment where the appellant was found.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    he was arrested, the appellant had some of the photocopied police buy money
    and just over 100 grams of marijuana on his person.  In the apartment bedroom,
    the police found a quantity of cocaine, a scale, a cell phone, a pager, and
    mail addressed to the appellant.  The Crown alleged that the appellant was
    the supplier to the drug dealer, Rhys Williams, who in turn sold cocaine
    to the undercover officers. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the undercover officer who completed the third purchase testified
    that she had conversations with Mr. Williams in which Mr. Williams indicated
    that he had to obtain drugs from his “guy” whom she believed to be his supplier.  She
    also testified that Mr. Williams then phoned the appellant and attended at
    the premises the appellant rented.  Surveillance officers confirmed that
    Mr. Williams had to be “buzzed”
    into the building because he did not have a key. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Williams was not called as a witness.  He was initially charged as a co-accused,
    but resolved his charges.  The trial judge pointed out in her reasons for
    judgment that there was no explanation given as to why he was not called.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that he formerly lived at the residence that was searched
    but had moved out some time earlier and that Mr. Williams was taking over
    the lease.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  He denied being a drug dealer, and stated that
    he had only stopped by the apartment for a drink and to smoke a marijuana
    cigarette.  Mr. Williams, he said, had paid him in cash for expenses related
    to the apartment, which explained the presence of the drug buy money on his
    person. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will refer to additional aspects of the background below where it is relevant
    to the issue being considered.  In the end, and for the reasons that follow,
    I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
  <h2>ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    discrete issues were argued on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         Did the trial judge err when she found
    that the appellant had powdered cocaine in his pocket when he was arrested? </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         Did the trial judge err by relying on
    the common law co-conspirators’ exception to the rule against hearsay when
    the principled approach would have warranted exclusion because necessity
    was not established?</p>
  <h2><i>1.         Mistakes of Fact:</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    her reasons for judgment and reasons for sentence, the trial judge indicated
    on several occasions that the appellant had powdered cocaine in his pocket
    when he was arrested.  The evidence was only that Mr. Williams had cocaine
    in his pocket upon his arrest. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown
    counsel acknowledges that the trial judge did err in this respect.  However,
    he submits that the case was so overwhelming against the appellant that it
    did not result in any trial unfairness, nor did it have an impact on the
    ultimate verdict.  Because I would allow the appeal on the hearsay evidence
    issue, there is no need to discuss this issue further. </p>
  <h2><i>2.         Hearsay Evidence: </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge admitted various hearsay statements made by Mr. Williams to the
    undercover police officer.  She relied upon <i>R. v. Mapara </i>(2005), 195
    C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.), to rule that the evidence was admissible.  She
    found that the statements fell within the co-conspirators’ exception to the
    hearsay rule and that Mr. Williams’ availability to testify did not warrant
    their exclusion under the “rare case” exception outlined in <i>R. v. Starr </i><span lang=EN-US>(2000),
    147 C.C.C. (3d) 449</span>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s decision to admit the
    police officer’s hearsay evidence regarding statements allegedly made by
    Mr. Williams that supported the finding that the appellant was his supplier.  The
    appellant did not challenge the trial judge’s finding that the hearsay evidence
    fell within the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule.  Rather,
    the appellant argues that since Mr. Williams was a compellable witness, there
    was no need to rely upon hearsay evidence.  The appellant argues that the
    trial judge’s analysis ignored this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Chang</i> <span lang=EN-US>(2003),
    173 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )</span>.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    believe it will be of some assistance to briefly first outline the two approaches
    to the admission of hearsay evidence that are in issue in this case.</p>
  <h2><i>(a)       The co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule allows the acts and declarations
    of an accused's alleged co-conspirators, done or made in furtherance of the
    conspiracy, to be adduced as evidence against the accused<a name=r2></a>: <i>R.
    v. Carter </i>(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 568 (S.C.C.).  Following <i>Carter</i>,
    co-conspirators’ statements will be admissible against an accused person
    if: (i) the trier of fact is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy
    existed; and (ii) if independent evidence, directly admissible against the
    accused person, establishes on a balance of probabilities that the accused
    was a member of the conspiracy. </p>
  <h2><i>(b)       The principled approach to hearsay evidence</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    basic principle regarding hearsay evidence is that it is generally excluded
    because it is not the best evidence, as compared to direct evidence, and
    since it is not given under oath and generally cannot be tested by cross-examination,
    it may be unreliable.&nbsp; However, hearsay evidence can be admitted if
    it falls under one of the traditional exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary
    rule.  Hearsay evidence can also be admitted if it is shown to be necessary
    and reliable.   Together, the requirements of necessity and reliability make
    up the “principled approach” to the admission of hearsay evidence: see <i>R.
    v. Khan</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later,
    in <i>Starr</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the traditional categorical
    exceptions to the general exclusionary rule for hearsay are to be interpreted
    in a manner consistent with the principled approach to determine the admissibility
    of hearsay evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span
style='color:black'>Starr</span></i><span
style='color:black'> also held that evidence falling within a traditional exception
      is presumptively admissible because the exceptions typically have an inherent
      component of necessity and reliability.  However, when an exception fails
      to conform to these principles, that is, in a “rare case”, the principled
      approach can override the exception to exclude the evidence.  </span></p>
  <h2><i>(c)       The effect of the principled approach on the co-conspirators’ exception </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue of whether the direction in <i>Starr</i>, to re-evaluate the traditional
    hearsay exceptions having regard to the principled approach, applied to the
    rule allowing for the admissibility of co-conspirators' declarations has
    since been considered by this court in <i>Chang</i>, and by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Mapara.  </i>Both courts concluded that if the hearsay dangers
    are present, then the evidence must conform to the principled approach.
      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      I noted, <i>Starr</i> creates the basic framework for analyzing how the
      common law exceptions to the rule against hearsay interact with the principled
      approach.  This framework is summarized succinctly by the majority </span><span
lang=EN-US>in <i>Mapara</i> at para. 15:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Hearsay is presumptively
      inadmissible unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule.  The
      traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule remain presumptively in place. </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(ii)       A hearsay exception
      can be challenged to determine whether it is supported by indicia of necessity
      and reliability, required by the principled approach.  The exception can
      be modified as necessary to bring it into compliance.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     In
    “rare cases”, evidence falling within an existing exception may be excluded
    because the indicia of necessity and reliability are lacking in the particular
    circumstances of the case.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(iv)      If hearsay evidence does
      not fall under a hearsay exception, it may still be admitted if indicia
      of reliability and necessity are established on a <i>voir dire</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>And,
      as <i>Starr </i>pointed out, the party challenging the admissibility of
      evidence falling within a traditional exception will bear the burden of
      showing that the evidence should nevertheless be inadmissible.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Mapara</i>,
      the Supreme Court held that the co-conspirators’ exception generally meets
      the requirements of the principled approach to the hearsay rule (para.
      31).  The Court, at para. 18, described how the necessity requirement is
      built-in to the co-conspirator exception:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>The criterion of necessity poses
      little difficulty.  As stated in <i>Chang</i> [at para. 105], “necessity
      will arise <i>from the combined effect of </i>the non-compellability of
      a co-accused declarant, the undesirability of trying alleged co-conspirators
      separately, and the evidentiary value of contemporaneous declarations made
      in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy.” [Emphasis added].</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    requirement of reliability is also satisfied by this exception.  Relying
    on this court’s decision in <i>Chang</i>, the Chief Justice held at paras.
    24, 26:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>Proof that a conspiracy existed beyond a reasonable doubt
      and that the accused probably participated in it does not merely corroborate
      the statement in issue.&nbsp;
    Rather, it attests to a common enterprise that enhances the general reliability
    of what was said in the course of pursuing that enterprise. … </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>&nbsp;[T]he final <i>Carter</i> requirement, i.e., only
      those hearsay statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy can be considered,&nbsp; provides
      guarantees of reliability in the more immediate circumstances under which
      the statement is made.&nbsp; “In furtherance” statements “have the reliability-enhancing
      qualities of spontaneity and contemporaneity to the events to which they
      relate” (<i>Chang</i>, at paras. 122-23).&nbsp; They have <i>res gestae-</i>type
      qualities, being “the very acts by which the conspiracy is formulated or
      implemented and are made in the course of the commission of the offence” (<i>Chang</i>,
      at para. 123).&nbsp; This “minimizes the motive and opportunity for contrivance” (<i>Chang</i>,
      at para. 124).&nbsp; </span></p>

    evidence admissible under the <i>Carter</i> analysis is by definition hearsay: <i>Chang</i>,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… a statement that becomes admissible under the <i>Carter</i> process
    is hearsay and concerns about unreliability are very real.  Indeed, the dangers
    attached to the use of hearsay that give rise to the general exclusionary
    rule are all present in the case of a statement admitted under the <i>Carter</i> process.  The
    statement is not made under oath, is not subject to contemporaneous cross-examination,
    and the trier of fact has no opportunity to observe the declarant at the
    time the statement was made.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a

    the principled approach, it is nevertheless important to test the application

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    this case, Mr. Williams’ out-of-court declarations were to an undercover
    police officer who testified at trial.  The officer testified that Mr. Williams
    explained how he obtained drugs from his “guy”, phoned the appellant, and
    attended at the appellant’s residence.  The essence of the hearsay statements
    of Mr. Williams is reflected in these examples: “I can’t get it.  The guy
    who has the blow just left before you asked me.”  And, “The guy usually asks
    for more but when he sees it’s me it will only be $230.”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, the hearsay evidence consisted of utterances to an undercover
    police officer that implicated the appellant in criminal activity.  They
    were intended to show that Mr. Williams was arranging drug transactions through
    his supplier, the appellant.  The utterances were not made under oath.  Moreover,
    in their formal trial they were recollections of the undercover police officer
    who had later written them down in her notebook.  Further, Mr. Williams did
    not testify and, therefore, was not subject to any form of cross-examination
    or observation by the trier of fact.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main question in this appeal is whether these out-of-court statements allegedly
    made by Mr. Williams, a co-conspirator, fall within the ambit of the “rare
    case”.  In the “rare case”, as articulated in the third proposition from <i>Mapara</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the evidence may be excluded for lacking the indicia of necessity and reliability.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='display:none;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to reiterate that it is the
    “combined effect” of the three justifications offered by the court in <i>Chang</i> and
    restated in <i>Mapara</i> that explains why the necessity requirement is
    met when a co-conspirator is being tried with the accused or is otherwise
    unavailable to testify.  Once again, they are: (i) the non-compellability
    of a co-accused defendant; (ii) the undesirability of trying alleged co-conspirators
    separately; and, (iii) the evidentiary value of contemporaneous declarations.  Significantly,
    only the third has application to the situation where the declarant is available
    to testify. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s position hinges on the availability of the declarant, Mr. Williams.  The
      appellant makes a straightforward argument: Where a declarant is available
      and compellable to testify on behalf of the Crown, it is impossible to
      hold that the necessity requirement is met so that the declarant’s out-of-court
      statements may be admitted for their truth.  In other words, the first
      justification of necessity is not met.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s argument in response focuses on the third justification, which is
    the unique character of the evidence, and not on which witness introduces
    it to the court.  The assumption in this argument is that Mr. Williams — the
    available declarant in this case — would not be able to replicate the statements
    he made to the undercover police officer who bought drugs from him, which
    is sufficient to satisfy the necessity condition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of this argument, the Crown cites various non-binding authorities:
    a decision from the United States Supreme Court<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and two decisions of the Ontario Superior Court
    of Justice.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  These authorities contemplate fact situations
    that are different from the facts in this case, however.  In the cited cases,
    either the statements at issue were direct communications between co-conspirators
    or the trial judge had found it unlikely that the co-conspirator would be
    a cooperative witness.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the communications were between an undercover police officer and a co-conspirator.  While
    Mr. Williams no doubt perceived the undercover officer to be a co-conspirator,
    his statements were recorded later-on by the officer from her perspective
    as an undercover officer, not as a co-conspirator.  This makes these statements
    potentially less reliable than the direct communication between two actual
    co-conspirators whose conversation was recorded contemporaneously.  In addition,
    there is no evidence that Mr. Williams would be an uncooperative witness.  These
    differences distinguish our case from the cases cited by the Crown, which
    did not exclude the hearsay statements. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also disagree with the Crown’s submission that <i>Chang</i> and <i>Mapara</i> stand
    for the principle that the quality or unique character of the evidence admitted
    under the <i>Carter</i> test, by itself, satisfies the criterion of necessity.  Again,
    the principle of necessity is defined by a combination of three justifications,
    not just one alone.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    for the appellant’s argument, this court in <i>Chang</i> specifically left
    open the question of whether the necessity requirement is met when the declarant
    is available.  <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Chang</i>, the appellant was tried
    jointly with his alleged co-conspirator.  On the issue of necessity, while
    the court considered the issue of whether the necessity requirement is met
    when the declarant is available, it explicitly chose to leave the question
    for another case (para. 110).  This is that case.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    it is clear to me that in <i>Mapara</i> the Supreme Court of Canada limited
    its decision on the issue of necessity to circumstances where the declarant
    was unavailable.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  For example, at para. 14 in <i>Mapara</i>, the
    Court observed that exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay evidence
    evolved in response to the defects inherent in such evidence.  Thus, exceptions
    emerged when, “the evidence is necessary, in that the person who made the
    hearsay statement is not readily available.&nbsp; And it is reliable, in
    the sense that something about it provides a circumstantial guarantee of
    trustworthiness.”  And again, at para. 37, the Court concluded that the case
    was not a “rare exception” because, in part, necessity was established due
    to the absence of direct evidence from the co-accused declarants. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>There
      is no doubt in my mind that the availability of the declarant, in some
      circumstances, can support the “rare exception”&nbsp;in which the <i>Carter</i> test
      might yield to that required by <i>Starr</i>.  In other words, the availability
      of the co-conspirator declarant as a witness, may require that the declaration
      be adduced through the testimony of the declarant.</span></p>
  <h2>APPLICTION TO THIS CASE<i></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ultimate question to determine on this appeal, therefore, is whether the
    evidentiary value of contemporaneous declarations outweighs the traditional
    strong reluctance to admit out-of-court evidence, which has not been made
    under oath, has not been the subject of contemporaneous cross-examination,
    and where the trier of fact has no opportunity to observe the declarant at
    the time the statement was made: see <i>Chang</i>, at para. 85.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are points to be made on either side of this equation.  While other reasons
    will no doubt come to mind, I will refer to only a few.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the one hand, preventing the admission of out-of-court statements made by
    a co-conspirator who wishes to negotiate a guilty plea could have a potentially
    detrimental effect on the Crown’s case, and may make the Crown reluctant
    to accept such pleas.  This is especially true if refusing to negotiate and
    maintaining the case against the co-conspirator ensures that the statements
    are admissible pursuant to <i>Mapara</i>.  The pressure to avoid negotiation
    is contrary to an efficient administration of the criminal justice system
    and could penalize co-conspirators who wish to plead guilty in exchange for
    a more favourable sentencing recommendation from the Crown.  </p>

    the other hand, the traditional reluctance to admit out-of-court statements
    is well-placed.  Unlike the other evidence admitted for the trier of fact
    to consider, the statements will not have been made under oath; they will
    not have been the subject of contemporaneous cross-examination; and, the
    trier of fact will have had no opportunity to observe the declarant at the
    time the statement was made.  </p>

      v. Smith</i> (1992) 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 268, the Supreme Court of Canada
      stated that, “the circumstances under which the declarant makes a statement
      may be such as to guarantee its reliability, irrespective of the availability
      of cross-examination”.  Further, where the hearsay evidence is necessary – the
      declarant is unavailable and the contemporaneous declarations have evidentiary
      value – it becomes the best evidence available.</p>

    trial judge addressed the necessity and reliability of the evidence briefly
    in her reasons for judgment.  She found the evidence to fall within the hearsay
    exception.  She also found that this was not a rare case where necessity
    and reliability were lacking.  On further analysis, I cannot agree with her
    conclusion.  In this case, the co-conspirator’s out-of-court statements were
    neither necessary nor reliable.   </p>

style='color:black'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case where the Crown is faced with the situation of either tendering
    the hearsay evidence or having no evidence at all.  Rather, it appears that
    the Crown wishes to rely on the <i>Carter</i> hearsay exception because admitting
    the evidence this way instead of as testimony avoids the risks of unforeseen
    complications, which might discredit the reliability of the evidence.  For
    example, Mr. Williams may disagree with the undercover officer’s evidence
    about what he said; he might retreat from his earlier declarations; his evidence
    might suffer from an inability to fully recollect; or, he might have an explanation
    that is exculpatory of the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    be fair, the Crown also says that the hearsay evidence is basically superior
    to the testimony of Mr. Williams.  In other words, the hearsay evidence is
    necessary because — without saying why — better evidence is not available.  <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>It
    argues that this is a case where the circumstances are such that a truthful
    and accurate statement would naturally be uttered, and there was no reason
    for Mr. Williams to be deceptive.  I take this to be a reference to the third
    component in <i>Chang</i>, namely, a </span><span
lang=EN-US>contemporaneous declaration made in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    as the Supreme Court of Canada observed in <i>Smith</i> at 271, “The criterion
    of necessity, however, does not have the sense of ‘necessary to the prosecution's
    case.’”&nbsp;  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case the statement was from a co-conspirator to an undercover police
    officer.  And, as I have noted, the evidence consisted of utterances implicating
    the appellant in criminal activity, which were recorded by the officer either
    hours after the transaction or the next day.  The intent of the evidence
    was to show that Mr. Williams was arranging drug transactions through his
    supplier.  At no time, however, does Mr. Williams identify his supplier. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that Mr. Williams, in this case, resolved his matter before the appellant’s
    trial suggests that he has reason to lessen his role in the offences he faced
    and to place a greater role on the appellant, both of which are at least
    indicative that he might be a cooperative Crown witness.  Importantly, whether
    or not Mr. Williams would be a cooperative witness, or whether there was
    any meaningful prospect of obtaining evidence from him, was never established
    in this case: see <i>R. v. Dionne</i>, 193 C.C.C. (3d) 228 (Alta. C.A.).  Cooperation,
    however, is just one factor in the analysis.  A declarant’s willingness to
    be a cooperative witness will not in and of itself determine whether the
    declarant’s out-of-court statements will be excluded.    </p>
  <h2><i>Reliability</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    my conclusion on the issue of necessity is sufficient to dispose of this
    appeal, I will nevertheless comment briefly on the issue of the reliability
    of the statements.  I do so given that the trial judge considered the reliability
    of the evidence in reaching her decision, and for completeness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view the hearsay evidence of Mr. Williams is not so reliable that cross-examination
    would add little to its reliability.&nbsp; Unlike in <i>Mapara</i>, this
    is not a case where the out-of-court statements were entirely recorded using
    a wiretap.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the officer testified that she made notes about her conversation
    with Mr. Williams later on in the evening or the following day.  Not only
    would this time lag create the possibility of inaccurate recording, her notes
    are also questionable insofar as she assumed that when Mr. Williams referred
    to his “guy” that he was speaking of his supplier.  While this inference
    may be reasonable, it is important to note that the trial judge disregarded
    the officer’s testimony where she offered opinions about the behaviour of
    drug trafficking for the reason that she did not have sufficient expertise
    in the area.  </p>

style='color:black'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    factors – the time lag and the officer’s insufficient expertise – are appropriate
    to consider in determining the reliability of the evidence at the admissibility
    stage.  In  <i>R. v. Khelawon</i> <span class=canliicitation><span style='color:black'>(2006),
    215 C.C.C. (3d) 161 </span></span>the Supreme Court made it clear that reliability
    need not be analyzed through the categories of threshold reliability and
    ultimate reliability (<span class=canliicitation><span style='color:black'>para.
    4):</span></span>   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>[T]he
      factors to be considered on the admissibility inquiry cannot be categorized
      in terms of threshold and ultimate reliability.&nbsp; Comments to the contrary
      in previous decisions of this Court should no longer be followed.&nbsp; Rather,
      all relevant factors should be considered including, in appropriate cases,
      the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence.&nbsp; In each case,
      the scope of the inquiry must be tailored to the particular dangers presented
      by the evidence and limited to determining the evidentiary question of
      admissibility.</span></p>

    given the time lag and the police officer’s limited expertise, the statements
    of Mr. Williams are not such as to guarantee their reliability without the
    availability of cross-examination.  This is not a case where it has been
    established that the interests of justice are better served by admitting
    the statements rather than calling the declarant as a witness.   </p>

    be tested in court, particularly through cross-examination, should generally
    prevail whenever it is possible to present such evidence, in furtherance
    of trial fairness.  The unique circumstances of this type of hearsay evidence — where
    necessity is not met because the declarant is available and where reliability
    is not met because of the way in which the statements were recorded — merit
    an application of the principled approach.  I can find no compelling reason
    why it should not be applicable in this case.  </p>
