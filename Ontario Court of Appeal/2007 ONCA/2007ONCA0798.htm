  <h2>I.          Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of various assault and firearms-related offences
    by the verdicts of a jury at a trial presided over by Trafford J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice.  The offences arose out of a robbery and shooting
    incident at an auto repair shop.  The appellant was sentenced to seven years
    imprisonment on one count each of the use of a firearm in a robbery and discharging
    a firearm with intent to wound.  His convictions on the remaining charges
    were stayed in accordance with <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  The
    appellant appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of his conviction appeal, the appellant mounts a twofold attack on
    the trial judge’s jury charge.  He argues that the trial judge misdirected
    the jury on the permissible uses of the evidence of certain out-of-court
    statements made to the police by the victim of the shooting and the victim’s
    brother.  He also submits that the trial judge’s review for the jury of the
    evidence of what the appellant told the police on arrest was fatally deficient.  In
    respect of his sentence appeal, the appellant maintains that his sentence
    of seven years imprisonment is unreasonable and that the trial judge failed
    to consider his rehabilitative prospects and overemphasized certain other
    sentencing factors.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the
    appeal against conviction and the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        Facts </h2>
  <h2>            (1)       The Shooting</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 19, 2003, the appellant went to a
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Scarborough auto repair shop to sell Shawn Ganeshram, an auto technician,
    a stolen television and Playstation.  The appellant asked for $400 but accepted
    $200 from Shawn in payment.  Later that evening, the appellant complained
    to Shawn that Shawn had paid too little for the goods and that he had paid
    with counterfeit money.  They agreed to meet at the repair shop the following
    day to settle the dispute.  The appellant returned to the repair shop on
    December 20, accompanied by two men.  An altercation with Shawn ensued, during
    which the appellant obtained another $120 from Shawn, the appellant punched
    Shawn in the face, and Shawn was shot in the leg by one of the three men.  Because
    Shawn had his back to the trio when the shooting occurred, he did not see
    who shot him.  Although Shawn’s brother, David (Dave) Ganeshram, was in the
    repair shop at the time, he did not witness the shooting.  He came to his
    brother’s aid only after he heard a gun shot.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Out-of-Court Statements</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    Shawn and Dave made several statements to the police following the shooting.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to police witnesses, when Shawn was taken to the hospital shortly after the
    shooting, he said that the appellant’s two companions had been carrying shotguns
    but that the appellant did not have a gun.  He claimed that one of the appellant’s
    companions was the shooter.  He made no suggestion that he saw the appellant
    with a gun at any point at the repair shop (Shawn’s Original Statement).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About
    three weeks later, Shawn identified the appellant as the shooter in a police
    photo line-up.  On this occasion, Shawn stated that the appellant grabbed
    a gun from one of his companions and used it to shoot him.  Subsequently,
    following the appellant’s arrest, Shawn provided the police with a description
    of the shooter that matched the appearance of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dave
    Ganeshram called 9-1-1 after the shooting.  In that call, he said that he
    saw only one man with a gun.  His description of the man with the gun did
    not match the appellant’s features.  Later that same night, Dave provided
    a videotaped statement to the police in which he said that he did not see
    the appellant or anyone else with a gun at the repair shop.  He also stated
    that he believed that the appellant was the person “wrestling” with his brother,
    and suggested that,
    “Maybe he’s the one who pulled the trigger too” (collectively, Dave’s Original
    Statements).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dave
    visited his brother at the hospital on the day after the shooting.  He then
    provided another statement to the police in which he initially claimed that
    the appellant had a gun at the repair shop and that his two companions also
    had guns.  Eventually, Dave said that only the appellant was in possession
    of a gun and that he had observed the appellant
    “racking” or “pumping” the gun to reload it after his brother was wounded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About
    one month later, the appellant was arrested and charged with several assault
    and firearms-related offences.  At the time of his arrest, he admitted punching
    Shawn at the repair shop, but claimed that one of his companions – a man
    named “Ram” – was the person who shot Shawn.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       The Trial</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issue at trial was the identity of the shooter.  The Crown maintained
    that the appellant was either the shooter or a party to the shooting.  The
    defence asserted that the appellant had no idea his associates had brought
    guns, that “Ram” was the shooter, and that the Ganeshram brothers had colluded
    to implicate the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown called Shawn and Dave as witnesses.  Both men implicated the appellant
    as the shooter.  Shawn said that although he did not see the man who shot
    him, the appellant and one of his associates each had a gun prior to the
    shooting.  Although the appellant had given his gun to his second companion,
    after he was shot Shawn noticed the appellant holding a gun and “racking
    it”, <i>i.e.</i>, preparing to reload it.  Dave testified that when he came
    to his brother’s assistance immediately after the shooting, he saw the appellant
    trying to do something with a sawed-off shotgun.  According to Dave, while
    Shawn lay wounded on the ground, Dave asked his brother who had shot him
    and Shawn pointed to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence cross-examined Shawn and Dave extensively on the contents of their
    Original Statements.  Neither adopted their Original Statements as truthful.  Shawn
    claimed at one point that his Original Statement was “completely” wrong.  He
    denied telling the police that someone other than the appellant had a gun
    and shot him, or that the appellant didn’t have a gun.  He testified that
    he believed that the appellant was the shooter because, after he was shot,
    he saw the appellant
    “pumping” a shotgun.  For his part, Dave indicated that he did not originally
    tell the 9-1-1 operator or the police that the appellant was the only man
    with a gun because he intended to “take care of the matter himself”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified in his own defence.  He admitted going to the repair
    shop on the day of the offences with two other men but said that he did not
    know that they were carrying guns or that they planned to rob Shawn.  He
    claimed that the stolen property that he sold to Shawn on December 19 ‘belonged’ to “Ram” and
    that “Ram” shot Shawn at the repair shop the next day.  The appellant also
    said that he first saw a gun when the shot was fired and that he did not
    see Dave at the repair shop at all.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence never asked the trial judge to admit the evidence of the Original
    Statements for substantive use.  As a result, no <i>voir dire</i> was held
    to assess the reliability of and necessity for the admission of this evidence.  As
    well, at no point prior to the defence closing address to the jury was there
    any suggestion that the defence wished to make substantive use of the Original
    Statements.  Moreover, prior to the close of the trial, the defence never
    sought to rely on the fact of the Original Statements to bolster the appellant’s
    credibility.  Instead, the evidence of the Original Statements emerged on
    cross-examination of the Ganeshram brothers by the defence, for the sole
    purpose of impeaching their credibility and their assertion at trial that
    the appellant was the shooter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his closing address to the jury, defence counsel at trial (not counsel on
    appeal) commented on the use by the jury of the evidence of Shawn’s Original
    Statement, suggesting that a comparison of that evidence with the trial testimony
    of the appellant should be made by the jury to assess credibility.  However,
    in subsequent exchanges with the trial judge in the absence of the jury,
    defence counsel acknowledged that Shawn’s Original Statement could not be
    taken by the jury as true, that Shawn’s Original Statement was not admitted
    for the proof of the truth of its contents, and that a clarifying instruction
    should be provided to the jury by the trial judge concerning the evidential
    comparison urged by defence counsel in his closing address.   Based on these
    acknowledgements, the trial judge instructed the jury on the limited permissible
    uses of the evidence of Shawn’s Original Statement.  It is that instruction
    that is challenged by the appellant on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 30, 2005, the appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, assault,
    possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, robbery with a firearm and discharging
    a firearm with intent to wound.  He was acquitted on a charge of possession
    of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.  He was sentenced
    to seven years imprisonment (four and a half years, in addition to two and
    a half years pre-sentence custody) on the counts of robbery with a firearm
    and discharging a firearm with intent to wound.  As I have said, his convictions
    on the remaining charges were stayed in accordance with <i>Kienapple</i>.  </p>
  <h2>III.       Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant advances two grounds of appeal against his convictions.  He argues
    that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that it could not compare
    Shawn and Dave’s Original Statements with the appellant’s statement to the
    police on arrest and his trial testimony, in which he identified his companion “Ram” as
    the shooter, for the purpose of assessing the appellant’s credibility – that
    is, to evaluate the truth of his version of events.  The appellant next submits
    that the trial judge’s review of the evidence of what the appellant told
    the police on arrest was incomplete and unfair. </p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Use
    of the Evidence </h2>
  <h2>of the Original Statements</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that in the light of significant similarities between the
    contents of the Original Statements and the appellant’s statement to the
    police on arrest and his trial testimony, the evidence of the Original Statements
    was capable of providing a circumstantial basis of trustworthiness for the
    appellant’s version of events.  In particular, the appellant submits that
    because the Crown argued two theories of the case – either that the appellant
    was the shooter or, alternatively, that he was a party to the shooting – the
    alleged similarities between the contents of the Original Statements and
    the appellant’s own version of events made it more likely than not that the
    appellant was telling the truth.  The appellant also contends that the evidence
    of the Original Statements was admissible for substantive use.  Consequently,
    the appellant maintains that the trial judge erred by limiting the jury’s
    use of the evidence of the Original Statements.  I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have said, Shawn and Dave did not adopt their Original Statements at trial.  Although
    open to it, the defence brought no application to have Shawn or Dave’s Original
    Statements admitted as prior inconsistent statements for the proof of the
    truth of their contents.  Nonetheless, during his closing address to the
    jury, defence counsel urged the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, the other part of [Shawn’s Original Statement]
    that I want to read to you because I think it’s important, or I suggest to
    you it’s important, it doesn’t matter what I think - - is this - - and I’m
    quoting from the statement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>[The appellant] and the two guys come out of
    the van.  [The appellant] is driving.  And I’m talking to my customer.  I
    say do you want the stuff back or the money?  I gave [the appellant] 120
    bucks but he’s upset and I notice the two guys with the shotgun, one pointed
    it at me.  [The appellant] told my customer to shut up.  [The appellant]
    punched me so I started to run to the shop, that’s when the guy with the
    checkered shirt shot me.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Does that not sound an awful lot like what [the
    appellant] told you?  I gave [the appellant] 120 bucks, well, [the appellant’s]
    version is not he gave it to him, he threw it in his face.  He’s upset.  Well,
    he’s clearly upset because he punched him in the nose.  And then, then is
    when he noticed the guys with the shotguns, he says two.  One pointed it,
    [the appellant] punched me so I started to run to shop, that’s when the guy
    with the checkered shirt shot me.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That’s pretty close to what [the appellant] said.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the completion of counsels’ closing addresses and in the absence of the jury,
    the trial judge sought the assistance of counsel about the proposed contents
    of the jury charge.  In so doing, the trial judge expressed concern with
    the above-quoted remarks by defence counsel, saying:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:      <i>Now, let me raise one matter
      of concern to me, Mr. Crewe, that came up during the course of your submission.  I
      need help on this.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Near the end of your submissions you brought to
    the jury’s attention the first statement that Shawn had given to the police
    --</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:      -- and made the observation that
    it was more or less consistent with your client’s testimony at trial.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>I’m wondering whether that is a permissible use
      of that first statement by Shawn.  We all know that the statement was admissible
      to prove -- was not admissible to prove the truth of its contents since
      it wasn’t adopted by Shawn but rather is admissible only for the jurors
      to take into account in assessing his credibility.</i>  This case is a
      little bit different because you’re alleging in effect that there was a
      common enterprise by the two brothers to fabricate evidence against your
      client.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>So I’m wondering whether or not what you invited
      them to do, as I understood your submission, requires them to use Shawn’s
      first statement as if it was admissible to prove the truth of its contents,
      as opposed to the fact that a statement of that nature was made.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Can you help me on that?</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>My instinct is that that first statement of Shawn
    is not admissible as an item of evidence that might confirm the truthfulness
    of your client’s version of the events. [Emphasis added.]<i> </i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Faced
    with this inquiry by the trial judge, defence counsel expressly disavowed
    any intention to invite the jury’s use of Shawn’s Original Statement as proof
    of the truth of its contents – that is, as evidence that the appellant was
    not the shooter or as evidence otherwise enhancing the appellant’s credibility.  Instead,
    defence counsel’s submissions focused on the jury’s assessment of Shawn’s
    credibility.  This telling exchange with the trial judge took place:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      No, I -- I -- </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:      You didn’t specifically cast the
    sub-mission in that spirit, but I don’t want some juror to go off on the
    tangent of saying look, Shawn’s first statement is exactly the same as the
    defendant’s version and therefore I’m inclined to have a reasonable doubt
    on this case.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      I appreciate that, your honour.  <i>And</i> <i>it
      certainly wasn’t intentional.  I didn’t mean to suggest that that statement
      - - that they can accept it as the truth of its contents.  And obviously
      your honour will instruct them on that</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>But they can use that statement, in my submission,
      to assess Shawn’s credibility on the remaining statements that he gives
      and also on the evidence that he gives this court.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:      I certainly agree with that latter
    observation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in his reply to the trial judge, defence counsel conceded the limited permissible
    uses of the evidence of Shawn’s Original Statement by the jury.  In ensuing
    dialogue with the trial judge, defence counsel again stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[THE COURT:]    Now, is this case any different
    because you’re alleging a common enterprise by the brothers to fabricate
    evidence implicating your client as the shooter.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      I would respectfully submit that
    that is something they’re entitled to take into account -- </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:      On the issue of collaboration, yes,
    which in turn may undermine the credibility of both of them.  I understand
    that.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      <i>But it still doesn’t bring that
      statement to the level of proof of contents, I quite agree with that</i>.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the light of these concessions by the defence, the trial judge invited submissions
    from counsel on whether a clarifying instruction should be included in the
    jury charge to address the comments made by defence counsel.  Defence counsel
    replied as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. CREWE:      <i>Obviously you have to tell them
      that they can’t accept that statement for the truth of its contents because
      he did not adopt it.  But they have to be told that the statement reflects
      upon his credibility in the sense that he gives subsequent inconsistent
      statements and does so after, in my submission, speaking with his brother.</i>  And
      that’s all I was intending to point out.  And I’m sorry if I treaded further
      than I should have.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, these remarks by defence counsel were centred on the jury’s assessment
    of Shawn’s credibility and the related issue of the defence assertion of
    collusion between Shawn and Dave.  Defence counsel did not address Dave’s
    Original Statements nor did he suggest that the fact of any of the Original
    Statements could be used by the jury to enhance the appellant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown, in turn, argued that the jury should be told that it could not use
    the suggested similarities between Shawn’s Original Statement and the appellant’s
    trial testimony to support the conclusion that both were true.  To do so,
    the Crown argued, would be an improper use of the evidence of Shawn’s Original
    Statement.  The trial judge agreed with the Crown as, apparently, did defence
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    sought and received the submissions of counsel, the trial judge instructed
    the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Regrettably, I feel it is my obligation to comment
    on the address by Mr. Crewe.  Near the end of his submissions, Mr. Crewe
    made an observation that the first statement given by Shawn Ganeshram to
    the police is more or less the same version of the events at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    80 Barbados Boulevard on December 20, 2003 as given by the defendant under
    oath at trial.  To use the first statement of Shawn Ganeshram as evidence
    tending to confirm the defendant’s version of events would require you to
    use the first statement as evidence of the truth of its contents.  That is
    an impermissible use of the first statement because Shawn Ganeshram did not
    adopt it as the truth when he testified at trial.  <i>The only permissible
    uses of the first statement are as a prior inconsistent statement by Shawn
    Ganeshram, to assess his credibility, and, further, as some circumstantial
    evidence of the defence theory that Shawn Ganeshram and David Ganeshram collaborated
    with one another to falsely implicate the defendant as the person who shot
    Shawn Ganeshram on December 20, 2003.</i>  Recall my instructions to you
    concerning the use of prior inconsistent statements of a witness and the
    examples I gave you in that part of my charge.  I am satisfied that Mr. Crewe
    did not intend to urge upon you an impermissible use of this evidence.  However,
    it is my obligation to instruct you to disregard this part of his submission.
    [Emphasis added.]   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, it is unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal to determine
    whether the Original Statements were admissible for their substantive use.  Given
    the manner in which this trial unfolded, including the positions taken by
    the defence at trial, I conclude that the trial judge did not misdirect the
    jury on the permissible uses of the evidence of the Original Statements.  I
    say this for four main reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    and importantly, the position advanced by the appellant on appeal regarding
    the permissible uses of this evidence is completely at odds with the position
    taken by the defence at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    his submissions and concessions at trial, described above, defence counsel
    recognized that Shawn’s Original Statement could not be used by the jury
    in a manner that treated its contents as true.  He also expressly acknowledged
    that his comments on this issue in his closing address warranted a clarifying
    jury instruction and that the instruction given should stress the use of
    Shawn’s Original Statement for only two purposes: to assess <i>Shawn’s credibility</i> and
    to support the defence claim of collusion by the Ganeshram brothers to implicate
    the appellant as the shooter.  In the end, there was no suggestion by defence
    counsel that either the contents or the fact of Shawn’s Original Statement
    could be used to assess the appellant’s credibility or to test the veracity
    of his version of events.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have mentioned, at trial the appellant invoked none of the well-established
    means for securing the admission of any of the Original Statements as proof
    of the truth of their contents.  It was clearly open to the appellant to
    seek such a ruling had he concluded, through counsel, that this would assist
    his defence.  Before this court, the appellant makes no assertion of the
    ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Accordingly, it must be assumed
    that the defence failure to request the admission of the Original Statements
    for substantive use was a strategic decision.  I make no criticism of this
    decision.  However, like any other trial tactic, it can bear consequences
    on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact is that the defence neither sought the admission of any of the Original
    Statements for the proof of the truth of their contents, nor invited a comparison
    by the jury of Dave’s Original Statements with the appellant’s trial testimony.  Nor
    did the defence submissions at trial concern the appellant’s statement to
    the police on arrest.  In his comments to the jury, defence counsel proposed
    only a limited use of the evidence of Shawn’s Original Statement: a comparison
    of that evidence with the appellant’s trial testimony.  Then, upon questioning
    by the trial judge, defence counsel expressly conceded the limited permissible
    uses of the evidence of Shawn’s Original Statement.  In that context, the
    defence cannot complain now that the jury instruction provided by the trial
    judge, which warned against a broader use by the jury of the evidence of
    Shawn’s Original Statement, resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  See for
    example, <i>R. v. Young,</i> [2007] O.J. No. 3974 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) at paras. 18 and 19.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
    before this court, the appellant urges an even broader use of the evidence
    of the Original Statements than was initially sought by the defence at trial.  He
    argues that a comparison by the jury of both Shawn <i>and</i> Dave’s Original
    Statements with the trial testimony of the appellant <i>and</i> with his
    statement to the police on arrest was permissible.  This recast approach
    to the proper uses of the evidence of the Original Statements was never advanced
    or urged by the defence at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the appellant cannot successfully contend now for a more expansive
    consideration of the evidence of the Original Statements than was sought
    at trial.  To hold otherwise would be to endorse multiple uses of this evidence
    by the jury in circumstances where, because of the tactical decisions of
    the defence at trial, no opportunity arose for the trial judge to evaluate
    either (1) the reliability of the Original Statements and the necessity (if
    any) for their admission at trial as proof of the truth of their contents,
    or (2) the merits of the exercise by him of his residual discretion to exclude
    the Original Statements, if warranted.  Moreover, no opportunity arose at
    trial for the Crown to challenge the broad use of the evidence of the Original
    Statements, or to respond to the assertion – advanced by the appellant for
    the first time on appeal – that the fact of the Original Statements, regardless
    of the truth of their contents, was capable of providing a circumstantial
    guarantee of the trustworthiness of the appellant’s version of events.  This
    issue simply never arose at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and significantly, the impugned jury instruction was responsive to the form
    of instruction that the defence suggested should be provided to the jury.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>   No doubt for this reason, defence counsel did
    not object to the instruction at any time at trial.  Although the failure
    to object to the instruction provided is, of course, not fatal to the appellant’s
    position on appeal, it is a relevant factor to be considered in assessing
    what prejudice, if any, the appellant suffered as a result of the instruction.  See <i>R.
    v. Nguyen</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 2129 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the trial judge raised the issue of the need for a correcting instruction
    with counsel before he delivered his charge to the jury.  The defence agreed
    that an instruction was justified and suggested the preferred contents of
    the instruction to be given.  Once the instruction was provided, the defence
    made no objection to its contents.  Nor did it seek a recharge on the matter,
    although it requested a recharge on other issues. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, defence counsel did not merely fail to object in this case.  He
    expressly agreed that an instruction was warranted, of the type in material
    part ultimately provided by the trial judge.  He made no complaint in the
    face of the instruction.  In this context, the observation of this court
    in <i>R. v. Pecoskie</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 4056 at para. 13 is apposite: “As
    a general rule, it should be a very rare case indeed in which an appellate
    court would decide that a trial judge has committed a reversible error on
    a matter which was expressly considered and agreed to by both counsel and
    the trial judge.”  See also <i>R. v. Ferguson</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 346 (C.A.)
    at para. 92 <i>per</i> Laskin J.A. (in dissent, aff’d [2001] 1 S.C.R. 281); <i>R.

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 14 and 15.  In my opinion, this case does not come within that
    narrow category of cases requiring appellate intervention notwithstanding
    the defence position at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    read as a whole, the charge was thorough and fair, both to the defence theory
    of the case and the defence position – as eventually reframed by defence
    counsel – on the permissible uses by the jury of the evidence of Shawn’s
    Original Statement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence theory was simple.  The appellant maintained that although he struck
    Shawn, he was not in possession of a gun, did not rob him at gunpoint and
    did not shoot him.  Rather, in respect of these offences, “Ram” was Shawn’s
    assailant.  In his charge, the trial judge directed the jury to scrutinize
    the circumstantial evidence tending to identify the appellant as the shooter
    with the “greatest of care”.  He emphasized that no eyewitness saw the appellant
    shoot Shawn and instructed the jury to “closely examine” the Ganeshram brothers’ testimony
    identifying the appellant as the shooter.  He specifically told the jury
    that the evidence of Shawn’s Original Statement could be used to assess Shawn’s
    credibility and, further, as some support for the defence claim that Shawn
    and Dave colluded to implicate the appellant as the shooter.  He provided
    several examples to the jury of the numerous inconsistencies in Shawn’s and
    Dave’s evidence, including in their out-of-court statements regarding the
    identity of the shooter.  Finally, <i>at the request of the defence</i>,
    he provided a strong ‘<i>Vetrovec’</i> warning to the jury regarding the
    dangers of accepting Dave’s evidence: <i>R. v. Vetrovec, </i>[1982] 1 S.C.R.
    811<i>.</i>  In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the
    jury understood the defence theory, the evidence that supported it, and the
    frailties of the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    for completeness sake, I add that I do not accept the appellant’s submission
    that the impugned instruction by the trial judge prejudiced the appellant
    by improperly criticizing defence counsel for making the jury submission
    in question.  The trial judge was careful to tell the jury that his comments
    on defence counsel’s closing address were not intended “to impugn his credibility
    or capability as a lawyer”, that his remarks were not to be taken as a comment
    by him on the strength of either the Crown or defence case, and that he was
    satisfied that defence counsel did not intend to invite an impermissible
    use of the evidence by the jury.  These comments were designed to remove
    any possible ‘sting’ in the minds of the jurors arising from the trial judge’s
    remarks about defence counsel’s submission, and to make clear – as defence
    counsel himself had indicated to the trial judge – that any overreaching
    in the submission was inadvertent.  I think that the jury would have understood
    the instruction for what it was – a direction from the trial judge to correct
    an unintentionally expansive submission by counsel.  The trial judge’s comments
    were not so denigrating of counsel as to deprive the appellant of a fair
    trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in light of the manner and purpose for which the evidence of the Ganeshram
    brothers’ Original Statements was introduced at trial, the position ultimately
    taken by the defence at trial on the permissible uses of the evidence of
    Shawn’s Original Statement, the input of defence counsel on the instruction
    to be furnished to the jury on this issue, the responsive nature of that
    instruction to the defence position, the absence of any defence objection
    to the instruction provided, and the overall fairness of the charge, I conclude
    that this ground of appeal must fail.</p>

    appellant also argues that the trial judge’s review for the jury of the evidence
    of what the appellant said to the police on his arrest was inaccurate and
    unfair.  He submits that there are important differences between his testimony
    as to what he told the police and the testimony of the involved police officers
    on this issue.  While the trial judge identified most of these differences
    in his charge, the appellant maintains that he erred by suggesting to the
    jury that the discrepancies in issue were denied by the involved police officers
    on cross-examination.  According to the appellant, this error was exacer-bated
    by the trial judge’s refusal to recharge the jury on this matter, notwithstanding
    defence counsel’s objection to the trial judge’s portrayal of the officers’ testimony.  For
    the reasons that follow, we did not call upon the Crown to respond to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge clearly told the jury that, on the appellant’s testimony, there
    were several “points of difference” between what the appellant claimed to
    have said to the police and what the police officers testified that the appellant
    had said.  The trial judge noted the appellant’s assertion that parts of
    his conversation with the police as recorded by one of the police officers
    in his notes were “incorrect” and reminded the jury that English is not the
    appellant’s first language.  The effect of this instruction was to bring
    home to the jury that the actual words spoken by the appellant in his police
    statement were contested and that the appellant may have misspoken or been
    misunderstood.  This warning benefited the defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also told the jury early in his charge that it was not bound
    by his review of the evidence or by any opinions that he might express concerning
    the evidence.  He quite properly directed the jurors that they could disagree
    with his understanding of the evidence, which he said might be incorrect,
    and stressed that the jurors were to be guided by their own recollections
    and assessment of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    instructions by the trial judge must be understood in the context of the
    closing addresses of counsel.  In his final argument to the jury, Crown counsel
    submitted that the police made no mistake in writing down the appellant’s
    words because what was recorded was “exactly what was said”.  The trial judge’s
    review of the evidence of the appellant’s statement on arrest and his cautionary
    words to the jury about the disputed evidence left open the possibility that,
    contrary to the Crown’s submission, the involved police officer may have
    erred in his recording of the appellant’s words in his notebook.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in his closing address, defence counsel also reminded the jury
    that English is not the appellant’s “mother language”.  He also drew the
    jury’s attention to certain of the differences between the appellant’s testimony
    on the contents of his statement and that of the police officers.  Importantly,
    defence counsel outlined for the jury the concessions made by the involved
    police officer regarding the accuracy of his notes and stressed the fact
    that the second officer on the scene had no notes of the matters in dispute.  Defence
    counsel told the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>And in fairness, Detective McGrath acknowledged
    he [the appellant] may have said it the way that [the appellant] says he
    did.  It could be, he said.  He also candidly admitted that it was sometime
    after he got back to the station that he made the notes.  And incidentally,
    Detective Constable Love has no note of that particular part of the conversation. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The appellant] says they were drinking.  And he
    did not describe them as his friends.  Once again, I’d ask you to bear in
    mind that Detective Constable Love has no note of that conversation and apparently
    no recollection of it.</p>

    any event, based on the transcript of the involved police officers’ testimony,
    it is unclear whether the trial judge misstated the evidence when he said
    that the differences between the appellant’s and the officers’ testimony
    were denied by the officers under cross-examination.  For example, while
    Officer McGrath, who recorded the appellant’s statement on arrest, acknowledged
    that it was possible that what the appellant claimed to have said was what
    in fact he did say, he also testified, “I just remember from what he said,
    I wrote it down immediately when I got to the station.  And as far as I’m
    concerned, what I wrote down is what he had told me.”  The trial judge interpreted
    the officer’s evidence, in effect, as an acknowledgement by him that “anything’s
    possible”.  This is a reasonable interpretation of the relevant exchange
    with the officer on cross-examination.</p>

    assuming that the trial judge was not entirely accurate or complete in his
    description of the police officers’
    evidence regarding the appellant’s statement on arrest, I am not persuaded
    that this defect in the charge impaired trial fairness or caused a miscarriage
    of justice.  In the end, the jury charge clearly stated the appellant’s version
    of events, his consistent claim to the police and at trial that “Ram” was
    the shooter, and the fact that there were differences between the police
    witnesses and the appellant on some aspects of the exact utterances of the
    appellant when he was arrested.  In these circumstances, the jury cannot
    have been misled.  I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>IV.       Sentence Appeal</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons for sentence, the trial judge observed that it was difficult
    to determine the factual implications of the jury’s verdicts because the
    Crown’s theory of the case embraced the possibility of the appellant’s culpability
    as a principal offender or as an aider or abettor.  Accordingly, some of
    the jurors may have returned verdicts of guilty on either basis.  In this
    context, the trial judge found that the appellant aided and abetted the other
    perpetrators of the robbery and the shooting.  He held that the common purpose
    of the appellant and his companions was “to shoot Shawn…with the sawed-off
    shotgun in retaliation for his payment of $200 in counterfeit money for their
    stolen property”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against
    this backdrop, the appellant appeals his sentence on two grounds.  First,
    he argues that his overall sentence of seven years was unreasonable.  He
    emphasizes that, on the trial judge’s findings, his role in the shooting
    was limited, he was not the actual gunman, he was not holding a gun, and
    he did not direct the shooting.  Second, he maintains that the trial judge
    erred by failing to take into account his rehabilitative pros-pects and by
    overemphasizing general deterrence and media reports of the use of firearms
    in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    crimes involved the brutal shooting of an unarmed man, resulting in serious
    and long-term injuries to the victim and adverse financial and emotional
    consequences for members of his family.  The victim gave no indication that
    he had a gun or any other weapon, nor was he the aggressor at any point.  The
    trial judge found that the appellant knowingly and purposely assisted his
    companion “Ram” in the intentional shooting of the victim with a loaded sawed-off
    shotgun for the sole purpose of exacting revenge over a dispute concerning
    payment of $200 in counterfeit money for stolen property.  As the trial judge
    commented, “This was crime to facilitate crime.”  Moreover, the appellant
    has a lengthy criminal record that includes convictions for violent offences
    and breaches of recognizance and probation.  At the time of these offences,
    he was subject to an order prohibiting his possession of firearms.  In my
    view, the sentence imposed was entirely fit.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also reject the appellant’s contention that the trial judge erred in
    his consideration of the appellant’s rehabilitative prospects or by overemphasizing
    general deterrence and the incidence of firearms use in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    sentencing reasons that I regard as exemplary, the trial judge addressed,
    among other matters, the appellant’s background, including his laudatory
    behaviour in jail pending trial, his educational history, his family circumstances,
    his approach to the preparation of his pre-sentence report and the sentencing
    hearing, and his expressed hope to resume a peaceful life upon release from
    custody.  These were all factors bearing directly on the appellant’s prospects
    for rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also explicitly considered the applicable principles of sentencing
    under s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In so doing, he neither overemphasized
    nor attached undue weight to general deterrence.  His consideration of general
    and specific deterrence was properly tied to the requirement that regard
    be had to the appellant’s rehabilitative interests.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I agree with the Crown’s submission before this court that the trial judge’s
    comments regarding the incidence of the use of firearms in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto were measured.  There was no suggestion at the sentencing hearing
    that consideration of this factor was inappropriate.  On the contrary, defence
    counsel acknowledged, responsibly in my opinion, the relevance on sentencing
    of unchallenged reports of the increasingly frequent use of firearms in the
    community.</p>
