    this case the appellant attacks the sentence he received for two convictions
    for importing cocaine that was imposed following the acceptance of a joint
    submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March of 2002, the appellant was arrested after importing some six kilograms
    of cocaine and granted judicial interim release.  He pleaded guilty almost
    three years later on January 24, 2005.  Some fifteen days later, in February
    2005, the appellant imported 466 grams of cocaine.  Again he pleaded guilty.  He
    was sentenced for both convictions at the same time.  The parties jointly
    submitted to the sentencing judge that he should receive thirty months imprisonment
    for the first offence and forty months consecutive for the second offence,
    in addition to pre-trial detention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge observed that the sentencing range for the first offence would
    be six to eight years and, given the aggravating circumstance that the second
    offence was committed while on release, the second count could well warrant
    a five-year sentence in and of itself.  He noted that the joint submission
    was for a sentence effectively in the neighbourhood of six years, considerably
    less than would otherwise be a fit sentence.  However, he accepted the joint
    submission because of the exceptional circumstances of the case.  On the
    first count, the appellant had acted under fear of another drug dealer and
    had assisted the authorities in prosecuting him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant now attacks the sentence primarily on the basis that the joint
    submission did not sufficiently reflect his cooperation with the authorities
    during the three year period that he was on judicial interim release on the
    first offence.  Accepting the value of his cooperation to the authorities,
    all the circumstances were known at the time the parties reached agreement
    on the joint submission, and the court had the information the parties agreed
    to place before it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that his counsel and the Crown mistakenly premised
    their negotiations on the range of sentence for the second offence being
    three to five years, whereas the applicable range is actually two to five
    years.  This argument cannot succeed as the lower end of the range did not
    apply to the facts of the second offence.  As noted, the trial judge remarked
    that it deserved a sentence at the upper end of the range, and the parties
    agreed that forty months was appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the sentence imposed improperly treated each of
    the two offences as an aggravating factor on the other.  We disagree.  The
    commission of the second offence while on release was an extremely aggravating
    factor.  In our view, the Crown was entitled to revisit its position on the
    joint submission in light of the appellant’s second offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to remember that appellant’s counsel joined with the Crown in
    advancing the joint submission. There is no suggestion of ineffectual assistance
    of counsel.  This court will not lightly interfere with a sentence imposed
    based on the acceptance of a joint submission.  We see no basis to interfere
    with the sentence in this case.  The sentence imposed was well within the
    appropriate range in the circumstances of the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave
    to appeal sentence is granted, but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
