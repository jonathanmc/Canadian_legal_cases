line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    by failing to find the respondent liable for damages for negligent
    misrepresentation and intentional interference with economic relations.  As well, the appellant raises for the first
    time the argument that the respondent is liable for breaches of fiduciary
    duty.  Each of these three causes of action
    is discussed below.</p>
  <h4>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant did not include a claim for breach
    of fiduciary duty in the statement of claim, seek leave to file an amended statement
    of claim, or otherwise advance this claim at trial.  In the result, the evidentiary record remains
    incomplete on both sides of the issue.  We are not persuaded that this is a case in which we should depart from
    the usual rule not to entertain submissions with respect to a cause of action raised
    for the first time on appeal.</p>
  <h4>Negligent Misrepresentation</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A representor is liable for damages on negligent
    misrepresentation where:  (1) there exists
    a duty of care based on a “special relationship” between the representor and
    the representee;  (2) the representation
    in question is untrue, inaccurate or misleading;  (3) the representor acted negligently in
    making the representation;  (4) the
    representee relied, in a reasonable manner, on the negligent
    misrepresentation;  and (5) the reliance
    was detrimental to the representee in the sense that damages resulted. See <i>Queen v. Cognos Inc.</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87
    at 110.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The requirements set out in <i>Cognos</i> are cumulative, meaning that a party must establish each of
    them to succeed in a claim of negligent misrepresentation.  We find it necessary to deal only with the
    fourth requirement in order to dispose of this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in finding the appellant had not established the requirement of reasonable
    reliance on the alleged misrepresentations.  Specifically, the appellant argues that it would not have entered into
    either the 1996 Memorandum of Agreement (the “MOA”), the first Overlapping
    Licence Agreement, or the second Overlapping Licence Agreement for the period
    of 1999-2004 (the “Agreement”) without the representations made by the
    respondent.  These representations
    include certain oral statements as well as statements found in Mr. Cutter’s
    letter of August 14, 1995, in the respondent’s business proposal in support of
    its application for a Sustainable Forest Licence, and in the Sustainable Forest
    Licence issued by the Minister of Natural Resources to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In general terms, the alleged representations were
    to the effect that the appellant would have access to its traditional lands for
    harvesting wood and would also receive sufficient allocations to continue its
    operations.  The appellant contends that
    without the MOA, the respondent would not have been granted the Sustainable
    Forest Licence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to these representations, the appellant
    argues that it was not allocated a fair share of the timber resources under its
    Overlapping Licence Agreement for the 1999-2004 period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Agreement allocated the appellant a fixed
    percentage of the total allocation of the harvest for the entire management
    area.  The Agreement did not give the
    appellant assurances that it could harvest in traditional areas, nor that it
    would receive allocations in excess of those fixed in the Agreement to continue
    operations.  The appellant does not argue
    that the respondent has breached the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant accepts that the trial judge made
    a finding that the appellant did not rely upon the respondent’s representations.  However, the appellant argues that this
    finding was confined to the oral statements and that the trial judge did not
    make a finding of no reliance with respect to the other statements referred to
    above.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We disagree.  The trial judge did make a finding of no reliance with respect to the
    oral statements.  As well, later in his
    reasons, after reviewing other evidence, including the respondent’s business
    proposal, the trial judge concluded that the appellant did not rely on the
    other statements.  Specifically, at para.
    19, the trial judge held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the end, I am
    not satisfied that there is any evidence that the defendant or its lawful
    representatives did anything to mislead the plaintiff <i>or to induce it to enter into the agreement</i> or that the
    representatives of the plaintiffs were in fact misled.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this passage, the trial judge speaks of
    inducement rather than reliance.  Leaving
    aside whether there is any material difference in the words in the context of
    this fact situation, it is clear that, when read as a whole, the trial judge’s
    reasons show that he found that the respondent did not make representations upon
    which the appellant reasonably relied when it entered into the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, there was ample evidence to support
    the trial judge’s conclusion. To start, the appellant’s representative did not
    testify that the appellant would not have entered into the Agreement except for
    the alleged misrepresentations.  Moreover, the appellant did not seek to have the respondent’s “assurances”
    included in the Agreement, despite the fact the appellant now argues that it
    relied upon these assurances when signing the Agreement.  On the contrary, it entered into the Agreement
    which contained an entire agreement clause.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the alleged assurances were sufficiently important
    for the appellant to rely on them in deciding to enter into the Agreement, it
    would have been reasonable for it to have raised them in negotiations and ask
    that they be included in the Agreement or otherwise addressed.  The appellant did not do that.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also did not explain how the
    statements could be misrepresentations with respect to the Agreement when the
    appellant had already operated under a previous Overlapping Licence Agreement
    for the 1996-1999 period.  As the trial
    judge states at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In order to
    establish misrepresentation, this Court would have to believe that, after
    operating under the 1996 agreement for three years, the plaintiff was somehow
    misled when it entered into the second agreement in 1999.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1999, when the appellant says it was told by
    the respondent that it must take the Agreement in the form presented or leave
    it, it did not seek to invoke the dispute resolution process set out in s.
    38(2) of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <i>Crown</i><i>
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Forest</i><i> Sustainability Act, 1994</i>, S.O. 1994 c. 25.  Again, if the alleged misrepresentations had
    the significance that the appellant now urges, it would have been reasonable
    for it to have sought the assistance of the Minister in addressing any
    concerns.  Instead, the appellant signed
    the Agreement which did not include provisions about harvesting in traditional
    areas or receiving allocations above the percentage set out in the Agreement.  Again, the appellant’s failure to take such
    steps is evidence supporting the trial judge’s conclusion of no reliance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to the business proposal, the trial judge
    noted that this was “nothing but a proposal to be weighed by the Minister in
    determining whether to grant a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sustainable
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Forest license to the
    [respondent].”  This characterization is
    fair.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, we note that Mr. Cutter’s letter of
    August 14, 1995 was not written by or on behalf of the respondent
    corporation.  At that time, the author
    was acting on behalf of the independent operators, including the
    appellant.  As such, that letter could
    not form the basis of a claim for negligent misrepresentation against the
    respondent.</p>
  <h4>Intentional Interference with Economic Relations</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Intentional interference with economic relations
    occurs where: (1) the defendant intends to injure the plaintiff;  (2) the defendant interferes with the
    plaintiff’s business by illegal or unlawful means; and (3) as a result of the
    interference, the plaintiff suffers economic loss.  See <i>Reach
    M.D. Inc. v. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Canada</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 30
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge dismissed the appellant’s claim
    based on a failure to establish the first element set out in <i>Reach</i>.  At para. 20, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In order to establish
    such a claim the plaintiff is first required to prove an intention on the part
    of the defendant to so injure the plaintiff.  Other than Mr. Groulx’s suspicions there is simply no evidence to
    support such a claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of his conclusion, the trial judge specifically
    accepted
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Mr. Street’s
    evidence (the representative of the respondent) that the respondent attempted
    to be fair in allocating timber rights to the appellant. The trial judge correctly
    pointed out that there was evidence showing that efforts had been made to
    involve the appellant’s representatives in the planning process over a period
    of two-and-a-half years and there was also evidence that the respondent, on
    several occasions, attempted to find timber for the appellant when it had used
    up its allocation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, it was open to the trial judge to
    accept
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Mr. Street’s
    evidence.  On that evidence, he found
    that the appellant had failed to show that the respondent had an intention to

    claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, we dismiss the appeal.  If the parties are not able to agree to costs
    with respect to the appeal, they should do the following.  The respondent shall submit its bill of costs
