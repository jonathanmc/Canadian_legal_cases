  <h2>I.          Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Marjorie Leudy (formerly Marjorie
    Riley), appeals from the judgment of Festeryga J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated October 20, 2005, whereby she was held jointly and severally
    liable with her former husband, Robert Gordon Riley, to pay general damages in
    the amount of $100,000 plus prejudgment interest to the respondent, Marcia
    Lorene Hockley, for historical sexual assaults committed by Mr. Riley against
    the respondent.  The trial judge also
    awarded the respondent exemplary damages against the appellant, in the sum of
    $20,000 plus pre-judgment interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant advances four grounds of
    appeal.  She argues that the trial judge
    erred: (1) by finding that she was in a fiduciary and trust relationship with
    the respondent at the time of the assaultive incidents; (2) by finding that she
    was present when those incidents took place; (3) by imposing joint and several
    liability for damages based on the criminal acts of Mr. Riley; and (4) by awarding
    exemplary damages as against the appellant.  The appellant seeks an order setting aside the trial judgment and
    dismissing the respondent’s action against her, with costs.  In the alternative, she seeks a reduction in
    the amount of general damages and the elimination of or a reduction in the
    award of exemplary damages payable by her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We called on the respondent’s counsel to address
    only the last ground of appeal.  For the
    following reasons, I would allow the appeal, in part, by setting aside the award
    of exemplary damages.  In all other
    respects, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the mid 1980s, the respondent resided,
    together with her parents, next door to the appellant and her husband.  The two families socialized over the
    years.  In 1999, when the respondent became
    pregnant with her own child, she told her mother that she had been abused as a
    child by Mr. Riley while he and the appellant were babysitting her.  She alleged that Mr. Riley regularly
    masturbated in her presence and touched her genital and breast areas on
    numerous occasions.  Following this
    disclosure, the respondent’s mother reported the matter to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Riley pleaded guilty to the ensuing assault
    and indecent exposure charges brought against him.  His guilty pleas at his criminal trial were
    based on an agreed statement of facts in which he admitted the abuse alleged by
    the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Riley did not defend the civil action for
    damages commenced by the respondent and was noted in default.  As a result, pursuant to r. 19.02(1)(a) of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, he was deemed to admit the truth of all allegations of fact made
    in the respondent’s statement of claim.  These allegations included the assertions that most of the sexual
    assaults perpetrated against the respondent by Mr. Riley occurred in the
    presence of the appellant and that the appellant had failed to intervene and
    protect the respondent from these assaultive acts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant did defend the action.  She acknowledged that she was aware of a
    propensity by her husband to abuse young girls and that she knew of his criminal
    record for sexually inappropriate behaviour towards young girls.  The appellant claimed, however, that the
    abusive incidents involving the respondent to which her husband had admitted
    did not take place in her presence and that she was unaware of them.  </p>
  <h2>III.       Discussion</h2>
  <h2> (1)       Challenge to the Trial Judge’s Findings</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant challenges the trial judge’s
    findings that she was in a fiduciary and trust relationship with the respondent
    at the material times and, further, that she was present when her husband
    abused the respondent.  At the outset, I
    observe that these findings by the trial judge attract considerable deference
    from this court.  The scope for appellate
    intervention with them is significantly constrained. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For several reasons, I am not persuaded that the
    trial judge’s impugned findings are tainted by reversible error.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the trial judge, as he was entitled to
    do, rejected the appellant’s evidence that the abuse in question had not
    occurred in her presence.  He found that
    she knew of the abusive acts or was wilfully blind to them, that the acts in issue
    took place when she was present, and that – although positioned to do so – she did
    nothing to prevent them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the course of oral argument before this
    court, counsel for the appellant acknowledged that these findings by the trial
    judge were supported by the evidence of the respondent’s testimony at trial,
    which the trial judge accepted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, counsel for the appellant also acknowledged
    before this court – responsibly in my opinion – that there was evidence at
    trial that supported the trial judge’s holdings that a relationship of trust
    existed between the appellant and the res-pondent, that the appellant owed a
    fiduciary duty to the respondent, and that this duty was breached by the
    appellant.  The trial judge found that
    the respondent’s parents left her in the care of the appellant from time to
    time, notwithstanding their apparent knowledge of Mr. Riley’s propensity to
    masturbate in front of young girls, because they relied on the appellant to
    “keep an eye” on and protect the respondent.  Importantly, during her testimony at trial, the appellant conceded that
    when the respondent was with her and her husband, she had a responsibility to
    ensure that no harm befell the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, the trial judge addressed the applicable
    principles governing the creation of a fiduciary relationship as set out in <i>Frame v. Smith</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, and
    concluded that the necessary prerequisites for such a relationship were
    satisfied in this case.  As I have said,
    the appellant’s counsel acknowledged during oral argument that the evidence at
    trial supported that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In all these circumstances, I agree that a
    relationship of trust existed between the appellant and the respondent and that
    the appellant owed a fiduciary duty to the respondent.  On the findings of the trial judge, that duty
    was repeatedly breached by virtue of the appellant’s deliberate failure to take
    any steps to prevent her husband’s abusive acts in relation to the respondent.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Joint and Several
    Liability</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would also reject the appellant’s challenge to
    the imposition of joint and several liability in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the appellant was
    negligent because she had actual knowledge of her husband’s improper conduct
    towards the respondent or, in the alternative, she was wilfully blind to the
    fact that he was sexually abusing the respondent, and she failed to take proper
    steps to prevent the abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also found that, at the relevant
    times, the appellant and her husband were both able to exercise some discretion
    or power in relation to the respondent, that they could each unilaterally
    exercise that power or discretion to affect the respondent, and that the
    respondent was vulnerable to the actions of the appellant as well as to those
    of her husband.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the findings of the trial judge, therefore,
    the appellant engaged in tortious conduct against the respondent distinct from
    that of her husband and acquiesced in or furthered her husband’s wrongful
    conduct.  These findings are sufficient
    to fix the appellant with liability on a joint and several basis, rendering her
    fully liable to the respondent for the damages awarded by the trial judge.  Her actions, as found by the trial judge,
    were those of a joint or an independent concurrent tortfeasor.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Exemplary/Punitive
    Damages</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reach a different conclusion, however,
    concerning the trial judge’s award of exemplary or punitive damages.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the trial judge explained that
    his award of general damages took into account the aggravating features of the
    case, including the fact that the assaults on the respondent were humiliating
    and undignified, that they began when the respondent was a young child, and
    that they persisted over many years.  He
    then stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>67.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to general damages I consider how
    the conduct affected the plaintiff.  I
    accept her evidence as stated in the reasons above.  I am satisfied that she was detri-mentally
    affected personally and in her relationship with her friends, parents and
    husband.  She will require assistance in
    the future.  I also must keep in mind
    that the post-traumatic stress disorder falls into the mild to moderate range
    in terms of frequency of symptoms and into the moderate range in terms of
    intensity of symptoms.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>68.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I assess general damages after taking into
    account any aggravating features and therefore include aggravated damages in
    this figure of $100,000.00 total against both defendants for which they will be
    jointly and severally responsible. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>69.       A
    breach of trust flows from a fiduciary obligation in equity.  Such a breach of trust may attract an
    independent damage award, but this award must be made under equity and not <i>tort</i>.  The Supreme Court of Canada has addressed this specific issue in <i>M. (K.) v. M. (H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6
    (S.C.C.) where it was held by the majority that the same policy objectives
    underlie awards of damages for sexual assault and for breach of fiduciary duty
    mainly, to compensate the victim and to punish the wrongdoer.  In my award of general damages I have
    included a figure for breach of fiduciary duty so that that one figure is all
    encompassing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s comments in the first two
    paragraphs, set out above, concern his assessment of general damages.  This is apparent from the introductory
    language of these paragraphs, which expressly refers to general damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is less clear, however, whether the trial
    judge’s remarks in the third quoted paragraph relate to various types of
    damages, or to general damages only.  In
    particular, in relying on the decision in <i>M.
    (K.) v. M. (H.)</i>, <i>supra</i> the trial
    judge referenced the policy objectives that “underlie awards of damages” for
    sexual assault and breach of fiduciary duty, commenting that these objectives
    are “to compensate the victim and to punish the wrongdoer”.  He then concluded this paragraph by again
    adverting to his assessment of general damages, indicating that his award of
    general damages included a figure for breach of fiduciary duty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To the extent that these remarks were intended
    to refer to the policy objectives underlying remedies for sexual assault and
    breach of fiduciary duty, they are unob-jectionable and consistent with the
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>M.(K.)
    v. M.(H.)</i>.  However, if, as I
    conclude, they are to be understood as reflecting the policy objectives of
    damages at large, that is, of general damages as distinct from punitive or
    exemplary damages, it is my view that the trial judge misspoke.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>General damages are compensatory damages.  They are awarded primarily to compensate a
    plaintiff for pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses suffered as a result of a
    defendant’s conduct.  Punishment is not a
    principal aim of general damages.  In
    contrast, punitive or exemplary damages are designed to punish the defendant
    and to deter both the defendant and other potential wrongdoers by addressing
    the objectives of retribution, deterrence and denunciation.  See <i>Fidler
    v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 61 and <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</i>, [2002] 1
    S.C.R. 595, at para. 43.  As Binnie J.
    put it in <i>Whiten</i> at para. 36,
    “Because their objective is to punish the defendant rather than compensate a
    plaintiff (whose just compensation will already have been assessed), punitive
    damages straddle the frontier between civil law (compensation) and criminal law
    (punishment).”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Whiten</i>,
    at para. 69, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    emphasized that punitive
    damages should be resorted to only in exceptional cases and with
    restraint.  Further, and importantly in
    the context of this case, the Supreme Court indicated at para. 67 that the
    mechanism in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for controlling awards of punitive damages “lies…in rationally determining
    circumstances that warrant the addition of punishment to compensation in a
    civil action”.  In explaining the court’s
    conclusion on the prerequisite of rationality for an award of punitive damages,
    Binnie J. indicated at para. 129 in the context of the jury’s punitive damages award
    in <i>Whiten</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   <i>The
    jury followed the “if, but only if” model, i.e., punitive damages should be
    awarded “if, but only if” the compen-satory award is insufficient</i>.  The form and order of the questions put to
    the jury required them first of all to deal with compensation for the loss of
    the plaintiff’s house (replace-ment or cash value), its contents, and any
    increase in her living and moving expenses.  <i>Only after those matters had been
    dealt with was the jury instructed to turn their minds to a final question on
    punitive damages.  They were clearly
    aware that compensatory damages might well be sufficient punishment to avoid a
    repetition of the offence and a deterrent to others</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the trial judge explained the
    basis for his additional award of exemplary or punitive damages against the
    appellant in one brief paragraph that followed immediately after the three
    paragraphs from his reasons quoted above.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With respect to [the
    appellant], I must consider the claim for exemplary damages which may be
    deserving of punishment because of its harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and
    malicious nature.  I must keep deterrence
    in mind.  I am of the view that such
    conduct should not be condoned but should be punished and deterred.  I find her conduct reprehensible and
    therefore award exemplary damages against her in the amount of $20,000.00.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, the trial judge reasoned that an award of
    exemplary damages was necessary to punish and deter conduct by the appellant
    that he found to be reprehensible.  However, the trial judge’s reasons contain no indication that, in so
    concluding, he related the facts of this case to the underlying purposes of
    exemplary or punitive damages and considered how, in particular, an award of
    exemplary or punitive damages would further one or other of the objectives of
    the law not already met by his award of general damages.  This was especially necessary in this case
    because, as I have said, the trial judge’s reasons suggest that his general
    damages award contained a punitive element.  This defect in the trial judge’s reasoning was an error.  See <i>Whiten</i> at para. 71.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the particular circumstances of this case, I
    cannot be satisfied that the trial judge undertook the necessary evaluation of
    whether an award of exemplary or punitive damages was necessary or rationally
    required, in addition to the sizeable award of general damages made by him, to
    achieve the stated objectives of deterrence and punishment.  Stated somewhat differently, the trial
    judge’s reasons contain no analysis of whether the general damages that he awarded
    were insufficient in all the circumstances and whether this case fell within
    that category of exceptional cases warranting an additional award of exemplary
    or punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The proper approach, in my opinion, was for the
    trial judge to award general damages for compensatory purposes.  A separate evaluation of the respondent’s
    exemplary damages claim should then have been undertaken, in light of the facts
    of this case, to determine whether one or more of the objectives of the law was
    not met by the award of general damages such that exemplary or punitive damages
    were required to achieve punishment of the appellant’s conduct and
    deterrence.  This did not occur in this
    case.  As a result, I conclude that the
    award of exemplary damages cannot stand.</p>
  <h2>III.       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would
    allow the appeal, in part, by setting aside the award of exemplary damages,
    together with associated prejudgment interest.  In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal.  Because success has been divided, I would
    make no award of costs for the appeal.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have read the reasons of my colleague and
    agree with her disposition of this appeal, apart from that in respect of
    exemplary damages.  As I will explain, I
    see no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of
    discretion in the award of exemplary damages.  He made no error in his articulation of the relevant legal principles
    and his findings amply support such an award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that it was not reasonable
    to award exemplary damages against her.  After all, as she points out, she did not actually commit the offences
    yet, as a result of the exemplary damages award, she is made to bear a greater
    financial responsibility than Riley.  Moreover, because Riley is judgment proof, she will end up being
    responsible for all of the damages.  A second
    argument, raised at the hearing, was to the effect that the trial judge awarded
    exemplary damages to punish the appellant but also gave punishment as a reason for
    the quantum of general damages that he assessed.  Consequently, it was argued, no special
    purpose was served by the award of exemplary damages.  I will deal with each of these arguments in
    turn. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is accurate to say that, as a result of the
    exemplary damages award, the appellant faces a greater financial responsibility
    than does Riley.  However, some years
    before the trial of this action, Riley was convicted of criminal charges
    arising from his abuse of the plaintiff.  After pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and gross indecency,
    Riley was sentenced to nine months incarceration and probation for twelve
    months.  To consider the damage award in
    isolation is to ignore the totality of punishment that the justice system has
    meted out to Riley.  The trial judge is
    clear: it was because of Riley’s conviction that he made no award of exemplary
    damages against him.  The role of
    exemplary damages is to make an example of the wrongdoer in order to deter
    others from committing the same tort (see <i>Norberg
    v. Wynrib</i>,<i> </i>[1992] 2 S.C.R. 226);
    Riley’s conviction and sentence had already served the purposes of punishment
    and deterrence.  Thus, the fact that the
    appellant would face a larger financial responsibility than Riley is no
    obstacle to the imposition of exemplary damages against her. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In order to respond to the argument that the
    trial judge erred because he used both general and exemplary damages to punish
    the appellant, it is necessary to consider the full reasons of the trial judge
    on the assessment of damages rather than to focus solely on the paragraph in
    which he concludes that exemplary damages are warranted. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relevant part of the reasons for judgment is
    entitled “Assessment of Damages”.  In
    this part, the trial judge begins by setting out that the plaintiff claimed
    general, aggravated and exemplary damages as against each of Riley and the
    appellant.  He notes that the plaintiff
    also sought compensation for breach of fiduciary duty by the appellant because
    of the appellant’s role “as caregiver, to care for and to administer to a
    child”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next, the trial judge considered <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>, <i>supra</i>, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on damages for
    sexual assault.  He quoted the following
    from para. 54 of <i>Norberg </i>expressly
    because LaForest J. indicates in the quoted passage when and how aggravated and
    punitive or exemplary damages are to be awarded.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5[4]. …aggravated
    damages may be awarded if the battery has occurred in humiliating or
    undignified circumstances.  These damages
    are not awarded in addition to general damages.  Rather, general damages are assessed “taking into account any
    aggravating features of the case and to that extent increasing the amount awarded”:
    see <i>N. (J.L.) v. L. (A.M.)</i> (1998), 47
    C.C.L.T. 65 (
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Manitoba
    Queen’s Bench) at p. 71 per Lockwood J.  These must be distinguished from punitive or exemplary damages.  The latter are awarded to punish the
    defendant and to make an example of him or her in order to deter others from
    committing the same tort; see
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Linden, <i>Canadian Tort Law</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ed.) 1998 at pp. 54-55.  In <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia</i>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1085, at pps. 1107-9, McIntyre J. thus set forth the
    circumstances where the defendant’s conduct would merit punishment:…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Punitive damages may
    only be awarded in respect of conduct which is of such nature as to be
    deserving of punishment because of its harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and
    malicious nature.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the guidance provided by <i>Norberg</i>, the trial judge refused to
    award aggravated damages in addition to general damages.  Instead, he took the aggravating features of
    the assaults into consideration when he assessed general damages.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge set out some of the many
    aggravating features in this case including that the repeated assaults and
    indecent exposure continued over a long period of time beginning when the
    plaintiff was a very young child.  He
    also considered the detrimental effects of the abuse on the plaintiff and all
    of her personal relationships.  He found
    that the plaintiff will require assistance in the future and that she suffers
    from mild to moderate post-traumatic stress disorder.  He then assessed general damages of $100,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter, the trial judge considered that a
    breach of trust may attract an independent damage award.  He referred to the decision of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>M. (K.) v. M. (H.)</i>,
    [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 which addresses this issue and noted the majority view that
    the same policy objectives underlie awards of damages for sexual assault and
    for breach of fiduciary duty, which objectives are to compensate the victim and
    to punish the wrongdoer.  He stated that
    he had included a figure for breach of fiduciary duty in his assessment of
    general damages.  By this last statement,
    I understand the trial judge to be refusing to award additional compensation
    for the appellant’s repeated breaches of fiduciary obligation because he had
    already given due consideration to that factor when he assessed general
    damages.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then considered the claim for
    exemplary damages as against the appellant.  Although he had already quoted the test for exemplary damages as
    articulated in <i>Norberg</i>, he reiterated
    that test, stating that exemplary damages may be awarded where the conduct is
    of such a nature that it is deserving of punishment because of its “harsh,
    vindictive, reprehensible and malicious nature”.  He found that the appellant’s conduct was reprehensible
    and ought to be punished and deterred.  He therefore awarded exemplary damages of $20,000 as against the
    appellant.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it would have been preferable had the
    trial judge reiterated the findings on which he concluded that the appellant’s
    behaviour was reprehensible, a reading of his reasons as a whole reveals that
    he made the necessary findings.  Those
    findings include the following.  Despite
    the fact that Riley pleaded guilty to the offences against the plaintiff well
    in advance of the trial, the appellant continued to maintain at trial that
    Riley was not capable of such misconduct.  The plaintiff’s parents left the plaintiff in the care of the appellant
    and relied on the appellant to keep their daughter safe when they were not
    present.  The appellant breached that
    position of trust on countless occasions.  The appellant knew of Riley’s problems and prior convictions for sexual
    offences but permitted the plaintiff to regularly be in Riley’s presence
    without other adult supervision.  The appellant
    had actual notice of Riley’s misconduct towards the plaintiff or else was
    wilfully blind that he was sexually abusing her.  The appellant was present with Riley and the
    plaintiff when Riley watched pornographic movies and would expose himself and
    masturbate.  The appellant did nothing to
    protect the plaintiff or to prevent the masturbation and touching to take place
    even while professing to love the plaintiff.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On these findings, which are amply supported in
    the record, it was open to the trial judge to find, as he did, that exemplary
    damages were warranted in order to punish the appellant and to deter others
    from committing the same egregious breach of trust.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see nothing in the reasons to suggest that the
    trial judge confused the objectives that underlie awards of general and exemplary
    damages.  He made explicit the need for a
    finding of reprehensible behaviour that warranted punishment and deterrence
    and, when the reasons are read as a whole, he made the requisite findings.  Consequently, in my view, there is no basis
    on which to interfere with the exercise of his discretion to award exemplary
    damages.  </p>
