line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the trial judge erred:
    (1) in finding that the respondent was wrongfully dismissed; (2) in valuing the
    respondent’s common shares as of September 30, 2005 as opposed to an earlier
    date; and (3) in requiring the appellants to pay bonuses to the respondent up
    to September 30, 2005. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4>Wrongful Dismissal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants submit that the trial judge erred
    when he found that the respondent’s payment of additional compensation and
    accelerated rent were not grounds for dismissal. We disagree. There was
    evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that neither ground gave the
    corporate appellant cause to terminate the respondent’s employment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, although the trial judge did not find
    that there was a binding agreement authorizing the respondent to pay additional
    compensation to himself and his wife (by way of income splitting), he did find
    that two of the four shareholders, including the respondent, believed that
    there was one.  Moreover, the respondent
    did not attempt to conceal the payments.  He entered them into the books and records of the company, and he
    answered honestly when asked about them.  The effect of the trial judge’s finding is that the respondent
    mistakenly, not fraudulently, made the additional compensation payments to
    himself and his wife. On this evidence, it was open to the trial judge to find
    that the respondent’s conduct did not constitute cause for termination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the trial judge also found that the
    alleged accelerated rent payments to the respondent’s brother were not
    sufficient cause for termination.  Again,
    the record supported this conclusion. In the end, there was no evidence that
    the corporate appellant was owed any money by the landlord.  Moreover, the accelerated rent problem was one
    that was created by all four shareholders, not just the respondent.  As the trial judge said,  “no one should have been taken by surprise by
    the accelerated rent issue”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no basis upon which to interfere with the
    trial judge’s conclusion that the corporate appellant did not have cause to
    terminate.</p>
  <h4>Valuation Date</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By way of statement of claim dated July 17,
    2002, the respondent sought a declaration that the appellants acted in an
    oppressive manner contrary to s. 248 of the <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16.  As relief, the respondent sought an order valuing his common shares and
    requiring the appellants to pay the value of those shares to him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On being served with the statement of claim, the
    appellants did not admit oppression, nor did they offer to buy the respondent’s
    shares at the then fair market value.  Instead, the appellants defended the action and counterclaimed.  On May 30, 2006, after a lengthy trial, the
    trial judge found that the appellants’ conduct had been oppressive, and he
    ordered that the appellants buy the respondent’s common shares valued as of
    September 30, 2005 (the most recent financial year end of the corporate
    appellant).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the conduct of the individual
    appellants towards the respondent after his employment was terminated was
    oppressive, unfairly prejudicial, and unfairly disregarded the interests of the
    respondent as a shareholder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the individual appellants
    were not justified in excluding the respondent from the management of the
    corporation.  In addition, the trial
    judge concluded that the individual appellants did not call formal shareholders
    meetings, did not declare dividends (to ensure that the respondent would not
    receive income from the corporate appellant), and paid bonuses to themselves. In
    addition, two shareholders used corporate funds to prosecute the litigation
    with the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants do not challenge the trial
    judge’s finding of oppression.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue only that the trial judge
    erred in selecting September 30, 2005 as the valuation date for the common
    shares.  They argue he should have used
    the date of the respondent’s termination in December 2001 or the date the
    respondent commenced his action, July 17, 2002.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In determining the valuation date for valuing
    shares in cases like this, the court should select the fairest date based on
    the particular facts.  There is no rigid
    rule or formula.  Rather, all of the
    circumstances of the case must be considered in making the decision.  See<i> Chiaramonte
    v. World Wide Importing Inc.</i> (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 641 at 656. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded his discussion of the
    valuation date saying, “after having found that Booth [the respondent] was
    wrongly terminated, I find that a fair valuation date would be September 30,
    2005”.  Booth, if not terminated, would
    have shared in the growth of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Alliance
    as was anticipated on incorporation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the trial judge
    impermissibly linked the selection of the valuation date to the termination of
    the respondent’s employment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not agree.  To start, it is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that he was aware
    that the valuation date was being selected in connection with the oppression he
    found as set out in para. 9 above.  The
    termination of the respondent’s employment triggered the oppression of the
    respondent as a shareholder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, a fair reading of the record discloses
    that the respondent reasonably expected a long-term relationship with the
    appellants, including receiving benefits from the client business he brought to
    the enterprise and from the accounting and computer systems that he
    installed.  Even after the respondent was
    wrongfully terminated, the business continued to benefit from the systems he had
    introduced and from the substantial client base that he left behind.  These benefits continued to accrue to the
    appellants up to the time that the trial judge ordered the appellants to
    purchase the respondent’s shares.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, when the respondent started the action
    in July 2002, the appellants could have agreed to the remedy he sought – namely,
    a purchase of his common shares. Instead, they continued with what the trial
    judge found to be oppressive conduct by excluding the respondent from any
    participation in the company.  In this
    way, they attempted to appropriate the company’s growth, rather than allow it
    to accrue to all the common shareholders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the
    trial judge’s selection of September 30, 2005 as the valuation date for the
    respondent’s common shares was reasonable.  We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4>Bonus </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge directed that the appellants pay
    the respondent fifty percent of the bonuses he would have received as a
    shareholder up to September 30, 2005.  The appellants argued that the period for payment of bonuses should have
    ended either on the termination of the respondent’s employment or on the date
    the respondent brought this action.  For
    the reasons set out above, with respect to the valuation date for the common
    shares, we agree with the trial judge that the appellants should pay the
    respondent bonuses for the period up to September 30, 2005.</p>
  <h4>Disposition</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs are awarded to the respondent and are
    fixed in the amount of $8,000, inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements. </p>
