style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 10, 2006, the appellant was found not
    criminally responsible (NCR) on account of mental disorder on a charge of
    criminal harassment.  She appeals from a
    subsequent disposition of the Ontario Review Board dated June 13, 2006, whereby
    she was ordered detained in a minimum secure facility at Whitby Mental Health
    Centre (WMHC) subject to various privileges, including the right to live in the
    community in accommodation approved by the person in charge of WMHC.  The appellant also appeals the disposition of
    the Board dated May 11, 2007, which continued her detention at the minimum secure
    forensic unit of WMHC subject to the same conditions imposed under the Board’s
    June 13, 2006 disposition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As acknowledged by the appellant’s counsel
    during oral argument, the appellant’s appeal from the June 13, 2006 disposition
    of the Board is moot.  The appellant is
    now detained under the Board’s May 11, 2007 disposition.  Accordingly, argument proceeded before this
    court in respect of the appellant’s appeal from the latter disposition only.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As framed by the appellant’s counsel during oral
    argument before us, the main issue on appeal is whether the Board erred by
    failing to consider whether the appellant could be conditionally discharged
    subject to the condition that she continue the medi-cation regime that she
    recently commenced at WMHC.  The appellant
    argues that when a conditional discharge subject to continued treatment is a
    live option for an NCR accused – as the appellant contends was the case here –
    it is incumbent on the Board, when considering possible dispositions, to
    inquire of the NCR accused whether he or she is prepared to consent to the
    proposed course of treatment, as contemplated by s. 672.55(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Anything less, the appellant submits,
    constitutes a failure by the Board to properly exercise its inquisitorial
    functions in fashioning the least onerous and least restrictive disposition for
    the NCR accused.  Because this inquiry
    was not made by the Board in this case, and the evidence before the Board
    allegedly otherwise supported a conditional discharge, the appellant maintains
    that the Board’s assessment of a proper disposition was imbalanced and contrary
    to the requirements of s.&nbsp;672.54 of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree with the appellant that where an NCR
    accused seeks a conditional discharge from a mental health facility and such a
    disposition is a potentially realistic option based on the evidence adduced
    before the Board, the Board should consider whether the NCR accused might consent
    to any treatment conditions thought by the Board to be reasonable and necessary
    in the interests of the NCR accused.  This type of inquiry would position the Board to impose treatment
    conditions, where appropriate, as provided for under s. 672.55(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  It would also further the Board’s full consideration of the least
    onerous and least restrictive disposition for the NCR accused, as mandated by
    s. 672.54 of the <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, for two reasons, we do not agree that
    this type of inquiry was appropriate or necessary in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, by the time of her annual review hearing
    in May 2007, the appellant had been found incapable of consenting to treatment
    and that determination had been upheld by order of the Consent and Capacity
    Board.  As a result, by May 2007, the
    appellant’s sister had been appointed as her substitute decision-maker.  In these circumstances, a direct inquiry of
    the appellant as to her willingness to consent to ongoing treatment, as the
    appellant submits was required, would have served little purpose.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, and importantly, in our opinion the
    conditional discharge of the appellant on the consensual condition that she
    continue to take her medication was not a realistic option on the evidence
    before the Board.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was the uncontroverted psychiatric evidence
    before the Board at the May 2007 hearing that the appellant lacks insight into
    the gravity of the index offence and its effect on the original complainant and
    his family, her own illness, and the need to treat that illness with
    anti-psychotic medication.  Moreover,
    although the appellant began to take such medication during her detention at
    the WMHC in the winter of 2007, she initially refused to accept the medication
    and actively engaged in activities designed to avoid it.  It was the uncontradicted opinion of Dr.
    Johnston, the appellant’s treating psychiatrist, that unless the appellant was
    subject to further detention and required to adhere to a prescribed medication
    regime, she would likely cease taking her medication.  According to Dr. Johnston, this, in turn,
    could trigger a reversion by the appellant to her previous psychotic state,
    giving rise to significant public safety concerns.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, on the evidence available to the Board in
    May 2007, the appellant was not receptive to or understanding of her need for
    medication.  Nor was there any basis on
    which to conclude that she would voluntarily comply with a recommended
    medication regime.  Indeed, her past
    behaviours and her lack of insight suggested that she would not voluntarily
    comply.  In addition, the appellant’s
    substitute decision-maker at the time (her sister) was unwilling or unable to
    assume responsibility for ensuring that the appellant would take her
    medication, if she was conditionally discharged to live with her sister.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We recognize, based on this record, that the
    appellant made considerable rehabilitative progress while at WMHC following her
    receipt of medication.  In addition, on
    consent of the parties, we were told that the appellant is now living in the
    community with her sister pursuant to the conditions imposed by the Board’s May
    11, 2007 disposition.  We were also
    informed that she is taking her medication and complying with her reporting
    obligations to the WMHC at present.  These commendable efforts may well support an application by the
    appellant for an accelerated 2008 annual review hearing by the Board.  However, they do not displace or detract from
    the evidence before the Board in May 2007 upon which the challenged disposition
    was grounded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In oral argument, the appellant did not pursue
    the other grounds of appeal advanced in her factum.  For completeness sake, however, we observe
    that we are satisfied that, in fashioning its May 11, 2007 disposition, the
    Board was alive to and properly applied the requisite legal test under s.
    672.54 of the <i>Code</i> and, based on the
    totality of the information before it, that the Board’s disposition was not
    unreasonable.  Finally, in our opinion,
    the Board’s disposition and the conditions imposed were crafted with a view to
    and took proper account of the appellant’s liberty interests.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeals
    are dismissed.  We commend both counsel
    for their able arguments and assistance to the court.</p>
