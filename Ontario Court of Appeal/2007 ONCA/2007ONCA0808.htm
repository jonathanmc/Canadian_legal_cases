style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals from his conviction for
    sexual assault on three grounds.  He
    argues that the trial judge erred: (1) by finding that the complainant was
    drugged by the appellant; (2) by failing to engage in a fair and balanced assessment
    of the appellant’s evidence; and (3) by failing to consider the defence of
    honest but mistaken belief in consent.  We reject these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s finding that the appellant
    drugged the complainant was amply supported by the complainant’s evidence at
    trial.  The complainant testified that
    she accepted an invitation from the appellant to have dinner with him at his
    apartment.  After they dined and drank
    some beer, the complainant went to the washroom.  She said that when she returned from the
    washroom she saw the appellant, who had his back to her, pouring something into
    her glass, which she assumed was beer.  She stated that she began to drink what the appellant had poured for her
    but very quickly began to feel immobilized, disoriented and sick.  In addition, her vision became blurry and
    distorted, the appellant’s voice sounded far away, and she felt limp – like a
    rag doll or a dead person – although she was conscious.  The complainant indicated that although she
    had a high tolerance for alcohol, she had never felt anything like this before
    and that it was not an alcoholic high.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the Crown argues, this testimony painted a
    picture of “a rapid and over-whelming deterioration” in the complainant’s
    ability to function, the onset of which occurred almost immediately after she
    began to consume the last drink poured for her by the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on this evidence, which the trial judge
    accepted, it was open to the trial judge to find that the complainant was
    drugged by the appellant.  See the recent
    decisions of this court of <i>R. v. Bell</i> (2007), 223 O.A.C. 243, at paras. 30-37, leave to appeal to the S.C.C.
    dismissed [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 351; and <i>R.
    v. L.G.</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 3611, at paras. 5, 10 and 80.  No evidence corroborating the complainant’s
    version of events was required to support this key factual finding, which
    attracts considerable deference from this court.  We see no basis for appellate interference
    with it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also reject the appellant’s claim that the
    trial judge’s assessment of his evidence was unfair or inadequate.  The only issue at trial was consent to the
    sexual activity in question.  The
    appellant did not testify.  His
    videotaped statement to the police, in which he recounted his version of events
    including his assertion of consensual sex, was tendered at trial as part of the
    Crown’s case without objection by the defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that
    he took the contents of the appellant’s statement into account in assessing the
    totality of the evidence before him.  The
    trial judge indicated that he rejected the appellant’s version of events
    because it did not have the ring of truth, it defied logic, and the appellant’s
    manner of responding to questions posed to him during his police interview
    revealed what the trial judge regarded as an attempt by the appellant to
    structure his responses to the police so as to avoid incriminating
    himself.  These comments by the trial
    judge demonstrate that he considered and rejected the appellant’s account of
    events and his assertion of consent as being implausible and contrived.  This conclusion was also open to the trial
    judge on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the appellant’s contention that the
    trial judge erred by failing to consider the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief in consent is unsustainable.  The appellant’s
    counsel acknowledged before this court, properly in our view, that once the
    trial judge found as a fact, as he did, that the appellant drugged the
    complainant without her knowledge as a precursor to sexual activity, this
    defence had no air of reality and was foreclosed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We note that the appellant’s assertion that the
    trial judge further erred by reversing the burden of proof was not pursued by
    the appellant in oral argument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
