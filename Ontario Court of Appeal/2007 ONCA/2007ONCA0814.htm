    appeal involves a claim to rights of aboriginal self-government.  The issue

    legal right to enact its own code of labour law to govern collective bargaining
    in relation to a commercial undertaking that operates on reserve lands.</p>

    Great Blue Heron Casino (the “Casino”) operates on the small reserve belonging
    to and occupied by the appellant.  Approximately one thousand employees work
    at the Casino, less than one percent of whom are members of the appellant
    First Nation.  A few months after the Ontario Labour Relations Board (“OLRB”)
    certified the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General
    Workers Union of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (CAW-Canada) (“CAW”) as the Casino employees’ bargaining agent under the

    the appellant’s Band Council enacted its own <i>Labour Relations Code</i> (the “<i>Code</i>”).  The
    appellant’s <i>Code</i> is closely modelled on the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 with certain significant exceptions.  The appellant asserts
    that it has the right to enact the <i>Code </i>and displace the <i>LRA</i> under
    its aboriginal and treaty rights, as recognized and affirmed by s.&nbsp;35
    of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>, being Schedule B to the <i>Canada Act

    OLRB rejected those claims and found that there was no ancestral practice,
    custom or tradition capable of supporting the right, properly characterized
    as the right to regulate labour relations on the reserve.  The OLRB also
    found that no treaty right was established that would lead to any right to
    regulate labour relations or, more broadly, a right to self-government.  The
    OLRB concluded that the <i>LRA </i>applied to the Casino and its employees.  The

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga tribe or nation, a branch of the Ojibway, and its members identify
    themselves as part of the Anishnaabeg.  The appellant occupies a small reserve
    near Port Perry,

    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Casino, owned by the appellant and operated by the Great Blue Heron Gaming
    Company (the “GBHGC”), a multinational conglomerate, is a Las Vegas style
    gaming facility with over fifty table games (black jack, roulette, poker
    etc.) and 450 slot machines.  GBHGC operates the day-to-day business of the
    Casino. </p>

    Band receives substantial revenues from the Casino which employs approximately
    one thousand workers (less than one per cent of whom are Band members) and
    operates seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.  The Casino is the only

    Casino opened in 1996 and CAW began its efforts to organize the workers shortly
    thereafter.  Casino workers voted to unionize, and in December 2002, CAW
    applied for certification under the <i>LRA</i>.  Although the appellant had
    publicly opposed unionization, it did not intervene in the <i>LRA</i> certification
    proceedings nor did it make known its intention to enact its own <i>Code</i>.  The
    OLRB certified the CAW under the <i>LRA</i> as the workers’ bargaining agent
    in January 2003.  CAW served GBHGC with a notice to bargain although bargaining
    could not commence until May 29, 2003 when the union was registered under
    the <i>Gaming Control Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 24. </p>

line-height:normal'> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant enacted its own <i>Code </i>on June 6, 2003.  The <i>Code</i> was
    passed at an informal Band meeting of the Band Chief and two Band Councillors.  There
    was no public notice of the meeting and no minutes were kept.  The appellant
    did not notify the OLRB, the GBHGC, the CAW or either the federal or provincial
    governments of its intention to enact the <i>Code</i>. </p>

line-height:normal'> [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant’s <i>Code</i> is a comprehensive modern-day labour relations code,
    closely modelled on the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>, but displaying some significant
    differences: strikes and lockouts are banned; a union must pay a fee of $3000
    and obtain permission from the Dbaaknigewin, the labour relations tribunal
    established by the <i>Code</i>, to speak to workers on the reserve; and workers
    must pay a fee of $12,000 to file an unfair labour practice complaint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When
    GBHGC refused to meet CAW to bargain in the face of the appellant’s <i>Code</i>,
    CAW asked the Minister of Labour to appoint a conciliation officer pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>LRA</i>.  GBHGC objected to that request, alleging
    that it was unclear whether or not the <i>LRA</i> applied.  The appellant
    informed the Minister of its position that the <i>LRA</i> did not apply and
    that the Casino’s labour relations were governed by the <i>Code</i>.  CAW
    then filed an unfair labour practice complaint with the OLRB alleging that
    the employer was not bargaining in good faith.  The Minister referred the
    issue of whether the Minister had the authority to appoint a conciliation
    officer to the OLRB, pursuant to s. 115 of the <i>LRA</i>.  CAW sought an
    expedited hearing on the ground that it risked decertification if no collective
    agreement was in place by the first anniversary of certification and a conciliation
    officer was not appointed.  The appellant intervened before the OLRB and
    served notices of constitutional questions on the Attorneys General of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:place

    on ancestral customs and practices of decision-making relating to “work-related

    contention that this evidence was capable of supporting the enactment of
    the appellant’s <i>Code </i>as the exercise of an aboriginal or treaty right.  </p>

      Act, 1982</i>, s. 35 recognizes and affirms existing aboriginal and treaty
      rights of aboriginal peoples.  Existing aboriginal rights include common
      law rights that recognize and give legal effect to the inherent right of
      aboriginal peoples to maintain the distinctive traditional and customary
      practices of pre-contact aboriginal societies that are not inconsistent
      with Crown sovereignty or basic common law principles and do not strain
      Canada’s constitutional structure.  Treaty rights are consensual in nature
      and arise from agreements reached between the Crown and aboriginal peoples. </p>

line-height:normal'> [16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While
    the jurisprudence of aboriginal and treaty rights is well-developed, relatively
    few cases deal with claims to aboriginal rights of self-government.  Before
    turning to that body of case law, I note that there is an established legal
    framework that determines the application of provincial laws of general application
    to aboriginal persons and aboriginal lands.  Pursuant to the <i>Constitution
    Act</i>, <i>1867</i>, (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.K. </st1:country-region>
    ), 30 &amp; 31 Vict., c. 3, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 5, s.
    91(24) and the <i>Indian Act</i>, s. 88, provincial laws of general application
    apply <i>ex proprio vigore</i> to aboriginal persons, provided they do not
    touch on the “core of Indianness” and provided they do not violate an existing

    when one looks to the <i>Code</i>, it is apparent that its subject is labour
    relations, not the regulation of work activities or controlling access to
    aboriginal lands.  It is common ground that the <i>Code</i> is essentially
    modelled on the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>.  The <i>Code</i> establishes a
    detailed regulatory framework to govern labour relations and to resolve disputes
    arising between employers and workers in relation to the collective bargaining
    process.  Neither the <i>Canada Labour Code</i> nor the appellant’s <i>Code</i> regulate
    work activities: under both regimes, that is left for negotiation and contract
    between the union and the workers pursuant to the collective bargaining process.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Nor
    can the <i>Code</i> fairly be characterized as controlling access to aboriginal
    lands. The sole provision relating to access to aboriginal lands, s. 50,
    only deals with access where any person wants “to enter on to the Reserve
    for the purposes of soliciting or seeking to solicit employees to join a
    union”.  The essential character of this provision of the <i>Code</i> is
    plainly the same as that of the <i>Code</i> as a whole: it deals with the
    regulation of labour relations and collective bargaining.  To the extent
    that it deals with access to reserve lands, it does so in a purely incidental
    fashion.  It would, with respect, be a gross distortion to characterize the <i>Code</i> as
    regulating access to reserve lands on the basis of a single provision that
    regulates access to reserve lands <i>only</i> where the party entering the
    land does so to solicit union members.</p>

    the provisions of the <i>LRA</i> with which the claim conflicts have nothing
    to do with access to the reserve or with the regulation of work activities.  The <i>LRA</i>,
    like the <i>Code</i>, is a modern labour code to regulate the regime of collective
    bargaining.  Sections 17, 18, 70 and 96 of the <i>LRA</i> were identified
    before the OLRB as being in conflict with the <i>Code</i>.  All of these
    provisions address the regulation of collective bargaining: s. 17 deals with
    the obligation to bargain; s. 18 deals with the appointment of conciliation
    officers; s. 70 deals with interference by employers; and s. 96 deals with
    the appointment of a labour relations officer to investigate a complaint.  All
    of these conflicting provisions point to the regulation of labour relations
    as the true character of the <i>Code</i>.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellants
    themselves would have this Court characterize their claim as to “a broad

    must be looked at in light of the specific circumstances of each case and,
    in particular, in light of the specific history and culture of the aboriginal
    group claiming the right.  The factors laid out in <i>Van der Peet</i>, and
    applied, <i>supra</i>, allow the Court to consider the appellants’ claim

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    on a pre-contact practice which was integral to the distinctive culture of
    the particular aboriginal community.  It is critically important that the
    Court be able to identify a <i>practice</i> that helps to define the distinctive
    way of life of the community as an aboriginal community.  The importance
    of leading evidence about the pre-contact practice upon which the claimed
    right is based should not be understated.  In the absence of such evidence,
    courts will find it difficult to relate the claim right to the pre-contact
    way of life of the specific aboriginal people, so as to trigger s. 35 protection.

    structure and its consensual and non-adversarial dispute resolution process.  These
    defining features are fundamentally at odds with the appellant’s <i>Code</i> which
    is market-based, is hierarchical in structure and establishes an adversarial

    an aboriginal practice, custom or tradition is to be found in para. 19 of
    the Walters affidavit.  Given its importance to the resolution of this appeal,
    I set out that paragraph in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The chiefs and
    elders of each extended family unit, or local clan segment, within an Anishinaabe
    village met in council to decide upon the issues that confronted the community.  In
    the absence of coercive state institutions, negotiation and consensus between
    these family or clan leaders was the only method of coordinating social and
    political action, or of settling disputes.  At these councils decisions were
    made about which families would use which planting fields, or fisheries,
    or hunting areas, or trade routes at any given time.  Family rights of access
    to the band’s fisheries and hunting territories may have been re-allocated
    annually, or in some cases more permanent resource rights may have been acknowledged.  In
    general, the village councils were intimately involved in the organization
    of work-related activities within the village – including the organization
    of planting and hunting, and preparation of festivals and ceremonial or recreational
    gatherings.  The village council would also decide upon whether to grant
    permission to members of other clan-villages, or other nations, to travel
    through or hunt or fish within their territories.  Through the reciprocal
    exchange of gifts, which often had more spiritual than material value, agreements
    were reached permitting one clan-village to enter and/or use another band’s
    territory or trade routes.</p>

line-height:normal'> [38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    entirely agree with and adopt the OLRB’s conclusion on this aspect of the
    case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidence
    also established conclusively, that the regulation and management of labour
    relations as we understand that term, was in no way part of the traditional
    culture or practices of the First Nation.  There can be no doubt that there
    were no employees or employers and certainly no groups or organizations analogous
    to trade unions that purported to represent the interests of either employers
    or employees within the society.  There was no labour market, nor anything
    resembling a wage-labour relationship where labour would be sold in exchange
    for some form of compensation.  There is no evidence at all to suggest that
    the First Nation had a traditional practice whereby a decision making council
    (like the Dbaaknigewin) dealt in a hierarchical and coercive (terms used
    in the evidence) way with the regulation of relationships between what we
    might think of as employers, employees and groups of employees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Even if one were to recast the notion of “labour relations” at a much higher
    level of generality, there is nothing in the evidence and information provided
    by the First Nation to suggest that there was a practice of organized relationships
    delineating responsibilities and obligations as between those who would perform
    labour, and those who would have labour performed.  Moreover, (and this goes
    to the second branch of the test) it can certainly not be said that any such
    relationships formed an integral or defining part of First Nation’s society.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    the Board to conclude that the first branch of the test has been met.  There
    is no basis for concluding that there is an ancestral practice, custom or
    tradition which could support the claimed right - that being the regulation
    of labour relations on the territory of the First Nation.  Paras. 79-81.</p>

    even if we were to accept the appellant’s characterization of the right as
    an aboriginal practice to regulate work activities and access to aboriginal
    lands, such a practice could not be said to be integral to the distinctive
    culture of the appellant.  In <i>Van der Peet, </i>at para. 56, the Supreme
    Court rejected “aspects of the aboriginal society that are true of every
    human society (e.g., eating to survive)” as practices capable of supporting
    an aboriginal right and insisted that the focus be “on the aspects of the
    aboriginal society that make that society distinctive”.  The evidence led
    as to the traditional regulation of work activity bears no relation to modern
    collective bargaining. The appellant cannot escape this deficiency by relying
    on the fact that the aboriginal society organized the work activities of
    its members: the organization of work at that level of generality is a feature
    of every human society.</p>

    the appellants have failed to establish reasonable continuity between the
    pre-contact practice, custom or tradition and the contemporary claim.  While
    aboriginal rights are rooted in the past, they are not frozen, but are capable
    of evolving into modern form provided there is continuity linking the present
    exercise of the aboriginal claim to the distinctive character and nature
    of the right in its original form.</p>

    inspired by values of family, clan and connection to the land.  The <i>Code</i> is
    market-based, adversarial and inspired by the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>.  Its
    roots are entirely post-contact and derived from modern law dealing with
    contractual relationships between employers and employees in a post-industrialist

    custom or tradition was followed when the <i>Code</i> was enacted.  The <i>Code</i>,
    in the words of <i>Van der Peet</i>, at para. 73, “arose solely as a response

    to ownership, management and use of First Nations lands can somehow be converted
    into a plenary power to legislate in relation to all manner of activities
    that take place on First Nations lands.  As stated in its preamble, the Act

    efforts to amend the Constitution to include a right of aboriginal self-government
    and aims to make litigation “a last resort” by implementing self-government
    through specific “practical and workable agreements”.  When describing the
    areas in which the federal government indicates its willingness to negotiate
    self-government agreements, “labour/training” is identified as going “beyond
    matters that are integral to Aboriginal culture or that are strictly internal

    areas, “primary law-making authority would remain with the federal or provincial
    governments, as the case may be, and their laws would prevail in the event
    of a conflict with Aboriginal laws.”  I fail to see how this policy document,

    the appellant referred us to the <i>United Nations Draft Declaration on the
    Rights of Indigenous People (1993/4) </i>(since adopted by the United Nations
    General Assembly).  This convention, which
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada </st1:country-region>
    voted against and has not ratified, recognizes the right of indigenous peoples
    to “self-determination”, to govern their own lands and to have their own
    distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions.  While
    international law often is of assistance in the interpretation of domestic
    legal and constitutional norms, the general language of the <i>Draft Declaration</i> does
    not, in my view, provide any meaningful assistance to the resolution of the
    specific issue of Canadian constitutional law presented here. </p>

    the final analysis, the appellant’s claim is cast at a level of such generality
    that it amounts to an assertion that First Nations should be accorded a virtually
    unconstrained right of self-government in relation to any activity that takes
    place on aboriginal lands.  That submission is at odds with the governing
    jurisprudence, in particular, the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Pamajewon</i>. </p>

    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    appellant also relies on treaty rights in support of its claim.  The appellant
    asserts treaty rights under the Covenant Chain relationship, confirmed by
    the Treaty of Niagara of 1764.  Neither the Covenant Chain nor the Treaty
    of Niagara is the subject of a specific instrument or agreement.  The Covenant
    Chain, in the words of the appellant’s expert, Prof. Walters, consists of
    various “oral engagements and rituals at ‘council fires’ that were modeled
    upon Aboriginal legal forms and customs” and came “to embrace an entire set
    of constitutional assumptions about the relationship between the Crown and
    Indian nations”.  The Covenant Chain “secured peace, friendship, and military
    alliance between the parties; it also provided a ‘council fire’ at which
    issues of common concern could be discussed and resolved”.  Professor Walters
    describes the records of the Treaty of Niagara as being “relatively brief” and
    consisting of “speeches…
    given in the style and tradition of Covenant Chain protocol”.  The OLRB characterized
    the Covenant Chain, at para. 90, as “a set of documents and corresponding
    related historical events…[that] illustrates the development of the relationship
    between First Nations parties and European powers.”</p>

line-height:normal'> [50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For
    the purposes of this appeal, I do not find it necessary to delve into the
    history of the Covenant Chain and the Treaty of Niagara or to determine their
    precise legal nature and status.  Put at its highest, the appellant’s treaty
    claim, like its aboriginal rights claim, is general in nature and amounts
    to this: the aboriginal people were promised that they could live as they
    had lived before contact and that their customs and customary law would be
    protected.  There is no evidence arising from the records and conversations
    that comprise the Covenant Chain and the Treaty of Niagara of any specific
    term or promise that goes beyond a general understanding that, in the words
    of Prof. Walters, “provided the foundational terms for the Crown’s claims
    to sovereignty over Canada – and those terms were understood by native and
    non-native delegates alike to include the right of self-determination within
    native communities and lands.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    agree with and adopt the OLRB’s assessment of the treaty claim, at paras.
    92-93:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>It is undisputed that the Covenant Chain does not touch in any way upon
    the organization of the performance of labour. Rather, the First Nation argues
    that the Covenant Chain continues the aboriginal right of self-government
    that predated first European contact and has, since then, not been surrendered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The practices
    which are protected under the Covenant Chain, according to the First Nation,
    are cast at the same level of generality as those asserted as inherent rights.  It
    is clear even from the evidence relied upon by the First Nation that rights
    which might have been continued from this ‘treaty’
    have nothing to do with and do not speak in any way to the regulation of
    activity as between employers and employees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Covenant Chain and the Treaty of Niagara, at best, reflect the general nature
    of the relationship between the Crown and First Nations at the time and confirm
    the basic common law doctrine of inherent aboriginal rights.  As with the
    argument based upon inherent aboriginal rights, to accept the treaty argument
    would be to accept an aboriginal right of self-government on reserve lands
    of virtually unlimited breath and amplitude and exceeding anything seen to
    date in the jurisprudence of aboriginal treaty rights. Accordingly, I see
    no reason to disturb the judgment of the

    I would not interfere with the finding that the appellant failed to make
    out an aboriginal or treaty right to enact a labour relations code to apply
    to activities on aboriginal lands, it is unnecessary to decide whether the
    Crown has justified the <i>LRA</i> as a legitimate limitation on such a right. </p>

    appellant contends that the Crown breached its duty to consult and accommodate
    the aboriginal claim.  This argument, based upon the decision of the Supreme
    Court in <i>Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests),</i> [2004]
    3 S.C.R. 511 [<i>Haida Nation</i>], was not advanced before the OLRB as <i>Haida
    Nation</i> had not been decided, but it was argued before the Divisional
    Court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Haida
      Nation</i> holds, at para. 35, that the duty to consult “arises when the
      Crown has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential existence of
      the Aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely
      affect it”.  The scope of the duty is, at para. 39, “proportionate to a
      preliminary assessment of the strength of the case supporting the existence
      of the right or title, and to the seriousness of the potentially adverse
      effect upon the right or title claimed”.  Where the claim is weak, the
      duty of the Crown may be limited to giving notice of its intended action,
      disclosing information and discussing issues raised in response to the
      notice.  Where there is a strong case for the claim, the opportunity to
      make submissions, formal participation in the decision-making process and
      provision of written reasons may be required.  There is no fixed or mandatory
      standard that applies to every case, and it is open to the Crown “to adopt
      dispute resolution procedures like mediation or administrative regimes
      with impartial decision-makers in complex or difficult cases”: para. 44.  The
      court added, at para. 45, “The controlling question in all situations is
      what is required to maintain the honour of the Crown and to effect reconciliation
      between the Crown and the Aboriginal peoples with respect to the interests
      at stake.” </p>

    appellant submits that the Crown breached its duty to consult and accommodate
    when the Minister of Labour referred to the OLRB the question of whether
    the <i>LRA</i> or the appellant’s <i>Code </i>applied to collective bargaining
    between GBHGC and its employees.  I am unable to accept this submission for
    the following reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Haida
      Nation</i> establishes that three elements are required: (i) a credible
      claim for aboriginal right or title, whether or not established; (ii) actual
      or constructive government knowledge; and (iii) conduct that would infringe
      or interfere with the claimed right.  In my view, none of these elements
      is made out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> First,
    for reasons I have already explained, it is my view that the aboriginal claim
    asserted by the appellants was dubious from the start and therefore not sufficiently
    credible to call for consultation.  In any event, as I will explain further
    below, given the nature of the claim, it was reasonable in the circumstances
    for the government to refer the claim to the OLRB for resolution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second,
    the first time the government knew or ought to have known of the claim was
    when the appellant enacted its <i>Code</i>.  The appellants failed to make
    known any claim or right during the unionization drive and certification
    proceedings.  The government was faced with the appellant’s peremptory act
    late in the day and after the CAW and the GBHGC were fully engaged in the
    process<i> </i>mandated by<i> LRA</i>.  It is not clear to me what meaningful
    consultation could have taken place by the time the government had knowledge
    of the claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span
style='color:#3A3A3A;'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> This
    is closely related to the third element and the need for conduct that would
    infringe or interfere with the claimed right.  Ontario enacted the <i>LRA</i> more
    than fifty years ago, before the province knew or ought to have known of
    the existence of any claimed aboriginal right.  In <i>Haida Nation</i>, it
    was the government that proposed to take some action that could interfere
    with or violate aboriginal rights.  In <i>Mikisew Cree First Nation v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Canadian Heritage</i>), [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, another duty to
    consult case, the action triggering the duty was described at para. 49 as “unilateral
    Crown action”.<span style='color:#3A3A3A;'>  </span>Where the government
    knows or ought to know that its proposed action will have an effect on a
    claimed aboriginal right, it is precluded from blindly proceeding without
    first consulting with the First Nation community whose rights are or might
    be affected.  Here, however, it was the appellant, not the Crown, that took
    peremptory and unilateral action that initiated the dispute or conflict implicating
    a claim of aboriginal rights. <span style='color:#3A3A3A;

line-height:normal'> [61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    if I am wrong and a duty to consult did arise, the scope of any duty was
    minimal.  The duty to consult does not preclude the Crown from disputing
    an aboriginal claim that is asserted by a First Nation and litigating its
    existence before an impartial tribunal.  In the circumstances of this case,
    faced with the urgent need to resolve the dispute between GBHGC and CAW,
    the Crown acted appropriately in referring the matter to the OLRB: the OLRB
    is an impartial decision-maker with expertise in the area of dispute and
    the process gave the appellant a full opportunity to present its case.  Moreover,
    the appellant did participate in the OLRB proceedings, but did not refer
    to the duty to consult until after the OLRB decided the case against the
    appellant. </p>
