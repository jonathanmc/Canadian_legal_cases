  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted by a judge sitting without a jury on a charge of
    possessing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The
    pornography consisted of several videos found on the hard drive of a computer
    kept in the home occupied by the appellant, his girlfriend and her two children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence acknowledged that several videos found on the computer fell within
    the definition of child pornography set out in s. 163.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  The appellant also admitted in a statement to the police that
    he had been aware for several months that at least some of these videos were
    on the hard drive.  He did not testify.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial turned on whether the Crown had proved that the appellant
    had a sufficient measure of control over the videos to put him in possession
    of those videos within the meaning of possession as set out in s. 4(3) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial judge held that the Crown had met its
    burden.  Counsel on appeal argues that the trial judge’s conclusion is unreasonable
    and that this court should enter an acquittal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  The trial judge found that the appellant exercised
    sufficient control over the videos when he instructed his girlfriend to delete
    those videos, which he knew had been on the computer he used for several
    months, so that they would not be discovered by the authorities who were
    about to access his computer.  That finding was open on the evidence and
    provided a factual basis for the legal conclusion that the appellant was
    in possession of those videos within the meaning of s. 4(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h4>The Facts </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant lived with his girlfriend, Shirley Lewis, her fourteen year old
    daughter and her son who was in grade seven.  Ms. Lewis purchased a new computer
    in April 2002.  The computer was kept in the living room and all four occupants
    used the computer.  The appellant, Ms. Lewis and her daughter had personal
    files on the computer and downloaded material from the internet into those
    files.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 23, 2002, the appellant was arrested on an unrelated matter involving
    an allegation made by Ms. Lewis’ daughter.  That night while in custody,
    the appellant spoke to Ms. Lewis over the telephone.  She told him that the
    Children’s Aid Society would be investigating the family because of the charges.  The
    appellant urged her to delete his files from the computer before the authorities
    had an opportunity to look at them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Lewis was curious as to why the appellant wanted his files deleted.  She
    looked into the appellant’s folder on the hard drive and found a number of
    pornographic images involving children.  The next day, she showed these images
    to a police officer who attended at the home in connection with the charges
    involving Ms. Lewis’s daughter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    police seized the computer on August 7<sup>th</sup> and ultimately found
    sixteen videos on the hard drive that contained child pornography.  The videos
    were found in a program called “Morpheus” and in a sub directory called “Movies”.  There
    were 256 movies in the directory.  In addition to the child pornography,
    there were videos containing adult pornography.  Morpheus is a peer-to-peer
    sharing service, which allows anyone in the Morpheus network to download
    material from other computers in the network once that material has been
    made available to users in the network.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Lewis testified that she was aware that the appellant downloaded adult pornography
    on to the computer and that she sometimes watched it with him.  She did not
    know that there was child pornography on the computer until she looked into
    the appellant’s file after he told her to delete it.  Ms. Lewis never saw
    the appellant download child pornography and never saw the appellant looking
    at child pornography on their computer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Lewis’ son testified that he rarely used the computer.  He recalled walking
    by the appellant when he was downloading videos from Morpheus.  He saw pictures
    of naked people on the computer screen, but he could not tell their ages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Lewis’ daughter testified that she saw the appellant downloading pictures
    of naked people.  She also recalled seeing the appellant late at night watching
    pornography on the computer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant gave a videotaped statement to the police when he was arrested
    on this charge.  That statement was admitted into evidence.  In the statement,
    he told the police that he was aware, apparently from the titles of some
    of the videos, that there was child pornography on the computer.  He knew
    this for four or five months before he was arrested.  The appellant insisted
    that he did not know how the child pornography got on the hard drive and
    that he had never intentionally downloaded child pornography on to the computer.  He
    told the police that he had no interest in child pornography.  The appellant
    acknowledged downloading and watching adult pornography sometimes alone and
    sometimes with Ms. Lewis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his statement, the appellant indicated that he did not attempt to delete
    the child pornography when he became aware that it was on the computer.  At
    one point in the interview, he said that he did not think it was “his place” to
    delete those videos.  In another part of the interview, he said that “they
    should’ve been deleted” and that he had no reason for not doing so.  He admitted
    that he told Ms. Lewis to delete the material after his arrest because he
    knew “the computer would be investigated” by the authorities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Forensic
    examination of the computer revealed that the videos containing the child
    pornography had been downloaded on to the hard drive of the computer between
    May 9, 2002 and July 1, 2002.  Those videos had been accessed on various
    dates between May 9 and August 7 when the police seized the computer.  There
    was no way of knowing who had accessed the videos.  Five of the videos were
    accessed by individuals other than the police in early August 2002.  The
    appellant did not have access to the computer at that time.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h4>The Trial Judge’s Findings</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that while there was some uncertainty as to the name of
    the file or files the appellant asked Ms. Lewis to delete from the computer,
    there was no doubt, based on the appellant’s own statement that he had asked
    Ms. Lewis to delete files which he knew contained child pornography and that
    she had accessed those files and found some of the child pornography.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not find that the appellant downloaded the child pornography
    on to the hard drive, or that he accessed the child pornography for the purpose
    of watching the videos.  The basis upon which he convicted the appellant
    is set out in the following passage:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… [T]he accused
    knew what was on the videos and knew the videos were on the computer.  He
    exercised or attempted to exercise control over them by having them deleted.  His
    purpose, in my view, was not to delete them or to have them deleted simply
    because he did not want pornography on the computer, but rather, he did not
    want the authorities to find them.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</h2>
  <h4>Analysis </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    4(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> contains a definition of possession.  Section
    4(3)(a)(ii) contains the relevant part of that definition for present purposes: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>a person has
    anything in possession when he … knowingly</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(ii)  has it
    in any place … for the use or benefit of himself or another person;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Possession
    requires knowledge of the criminal character of the item in issue.  In this
    case, the Crown had to prove that the appellant had knowledge of the contents
    of the videos in issue.  It was, of course, irrelevant whether the appellant
    knew the contents constituted child pornography:  see <i>Beaver v. The Queen</i> (1957),
    118 C.C.C. 129 at 140 (S.C.C.);  <i>Rex v. Hess (No. 1)</i> (1948), 94 C.C.C.
    48 at 51-52 (B.C.C.A.).  The appellant’s knowledge of the nature of the videos
    was established by his statements to the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Knowledge
    alone will not establish possession.  The Crown must also prove that an accused
    with the requisite knowledge had a measure of control over the item in issue.  Control
    refers to power or authority over the item whether exercised or not:  <i>R.
    v. Mohamad</i> (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at paras. 60-61 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Daniels</i> (2004), 191 C.C.C. (3d) 393 at para. 12 (Nfld. C.A.), a
      case which also involved a charge of possession of child pornography in
      the form of material located on a computer hard drive, Welch J.A. explained
      the concept of control in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>To be in possession
    of child pornography, it is not necessary for the individual to have viewed
    the material.  For example, a person may obtain pornographic material in
    an envelope, but without viewing it, either place it in a drawer or dispose
    of it in the garbage.  <u>It is the element of control, including deciding
    what will be done with the material, that is essential to possession.</u>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her submissions, Ms. LeRoy argued first that the evidence did not support
    a finding that the appellant knew that the files contained child pornography.  This
    submission cannot succeed in the face of the appellant’s own admission in
    his statement to the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    LeRoy also submitted that the appellant’s direction to Ms. Lewis to delete
    the files containing the child pornography could not constitute an act of
    control for the purposes of fixing the appellant with possession of the pornography.  She
    submitted that the appellant’s instructions demonstrated an intention to
    destroy rather than possess the material.  She analogized the appellant’s
    position to that of a person who possesses drugs strictly for the purpose
    of destroying them by flushing them down the toilet.  Ms. LeRoy stressed
    that the trial judge did not find that the appellant played any role in downloading
    the pornography on to the computer or that he used the computer to view the
    pornography.  She contended that the finding of control was based solely
    on the instruction to delete and that this instruction was inconsistent with
    an intention to possess.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a line of authority supporting the proposition that exercising control
    over contraband with the requisite knowledge, but solely with the intent
    of destroying the contraband or otherwise permanently removing it from one’s
    control does not constitute criminal possession:  see <i>R. v. Glushek</i> (1978),
    41 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Alta. S.C. App. Div.);  <i>R. v. Christie</i> (1978),
    41 C.C.C. (2d) 282 (N.B. S.C. App. Div.);  <i>R. v. York</i> (2005), 193
    C.C.C. (3d) 331 (B.C.C.A.).  In <i>Christie</i>, <i>supra</i>, Chief Justice
    Hughes, in referring to what I would call “innocent possession”, said at
    p. 287:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>In my opinion,
    there can be circumstances which do not constitute possession even where
    there is a right of control with knowledge of the presence and character
    of the thing alleged to be possessed, where guilt should not be inferred,
    as where it appears there is no intent to exercise control over it.  An example
    of this situation is where a person finds a package on his doorstep and upon
    opening it discovers it contains narcotics.  Assuming he does nothing further
    to indicate an intention to exercise control over it, he had not, in my opinion,
    the possession contemplated by the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Nor do I think
    that a person who manually handles it for the sole purpose of destroying
    or reporting it to the police has committed the offence of possession. …</p>

    possession” line of authorities was helpfully examined by Green J. in <i>R.
    v. Loukas</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2405 (Ont. C.J.).  Green J. points out that
    some of the “innocent possession” cases recognize a public duty defence as
    for example where an accused takes possession of contraband to deliver it
    to the authorities.  In other cases, “innocent possession” is said to arise
    from the absence of an intention to exercise control beyond that needed to
    destroy the contraband or otherwise put it permanently beyond one’s control.  Green
    J. observes that in all of these cases there is, despite the existence of
    possession in the strict sense, an absence of a blameworthy state of mind
    or blameworthy conduct.  Convictions for criminal possession by a technical
    application of the concepts of knowledge and control in these circumstances
    would overreach the purpose underlying the criminal prohibition against possession.  </p>

    agree with the analysis described above.  There are cases where an individual
    has the requisite control and knowledge, but cannot be said to be in possession
    for the purpose of imposing criminal liability.  These cases will include
    cases in which a person takes control of contraband exclusively for the purpose
    of immediately destroying the contraband or otherwise placing it permanently
    beyond that person’s ability to exercise any control over the contraband.  In
    such cases, the intention is solely to divest oneself of control rather than
    to possess.  Like the other appellate courts whose discussions are referred
    to above, I do not think that criminal liability should attach to that kind
    of brief, “innocent” possession:  see e.g. <i>R. v. Glushek</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R.
    v. York</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

    am also satisfied, however, that this line of authority has no application
    to the findings of the trial judge.  His findings negate any suggestion of
    “innocent possession”.  On the trial judge’s findings, the appellant did
    not have possession of the child pornography strictly for the purposes of
    destroying that pornography.  He knew that the pornography was on the computer’s
    hard drive for several months.  During that time, he regularly used the computer
    and had control over the pornography in the sense that he could have deleted
    it from the computer at any time had he chosen to do so.  On his own admission,
    he ultimately decided to delete the pornography because he feared that the
    police would discover it when they examined his computer.  In those circumstances,
    the appellant’s instruction to delete the material was a manifestation of
    his longstanding power or authority over the material.  That control had
    existed for several months and was not merely incidental to an innocent purpose.  </p>
