  <h3>A. <u>OVERVIEW</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant, Richard Hayes, seeks an extension of time within which to appeal
    sentence.  He received a lenient sentence, based on a joint submission, for
    three criminal offences.  The sentence was demonstrably fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the conviction and sentence provoked an unusual and serious consequence.  Shortly
    after the sentence was imposed, the band council on the reserve where the
    applicant lived and worked, passed a resolution banishing him from the community.  The
    applicant departed and has not returned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant has challenged the validity of the band council resolution in the
    Federal Court of Canada.  However, he has also decided that he wants to appeal
    his sentence in the hope that if it is reduced to a conditional discharge,
    the band council might reconsider its banishment order.  When the applicant
    reached this decision, the 30-day period for appeal had lapsed – by four
    days.  Hence the applicant brings this application for an extension of time.</p>
  <h3>B.<u> FACTS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard
    Hayes, a non-First Nations person, has lived with his common law spouse,
    Donna Shilling, a First Nations woman, on the Curve Lake First Nation Indian
    Reserve for almost five years.  Ms. Shilling, a long-time band member, owns,
    and she and the applicant manage, Charlie’s Bay Convenience and Marina.  With
    some seasonal fluctuation, the business employs about eight people.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 26, 2007, the applicant, who had no previous criminal record, pleaded
    guilty to three charges: possession of a controlled substance for the purpose
    of trafficking (marijuana, 600 g) contrary to s. 5(2) of the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>, possession of property obtained by crime (about
    $300 in cash) contrary to s. 354(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and possession
    of a weapon for a dangerous purpose (a telescoping baton) contrary to s.
    88 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The marijuana and baton were found in the
    couple’s residence.  The money was found on the applicant’s person.  Ms.
    Shilling was also charged; the charges against her were withdrawn immediately
    after the applicant was convicted and sentenced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a joint submission which he accepted, the trial judge, Morgan J., imposed
    a sentence of a $1000 fine and a $150 victim fine surcharge for the drug
    offence and a suspended sentence with one year’s non-reporting probation
    and a forfeiture order for the <i>Criminal Code</i> offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    weeks later, on October 11, 2007, the Chief of Curve <span lang=EN-GB>Lake’s</span> Anishinabek
    Police came to the convenience store and delivered band council Resolution
    Number 479/2007-2008-17, which provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THAT Rick Hayes is an undesirable due to his criminal
    record, which includes Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking, Possession
    of Marijuana, and Possession of a Prohibited Weapon.  His presence being
    reported to Chief and Council by the Anishinabek Police Service;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>AND WHEREAS Rick Hayes is not a Status Indian or
    a member of Curve Lake First Nation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>AND WHEREAS Rick Hayes does not have a leasehold
    interest on Curve Lake Indian Reserve No. 35 and 35A;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THEREFORE, he has been deemed undesirable and no
    longer welcome on Curve Lake Indian Reserve No. 35 and 35A.  Therefore Rick
    Hayes is no longer allowed to reside or set foot on Curve Lake Indian Reserve
    No. 35 and 35A without prior written permission of Chief and Council.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Rick Hayes
    has 12 hours from receipt of this First Nation Council Resolution to remove
    himself and his personal belongings from Curve Lake Indian Reserve No. 35
    and 35 A.</p>
  <p>The resolution was signed by the chief and seven of the eight band councillors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant and Ms. Shilling left the reserve and took up residence in a log
    cabin with no central heating or running water on a friend’s property about
    a forty-five minute drive from the reserve.  Ms. Shilling drove back daily
    to work at the store.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the reserve, which was a population of less than 1000, almost immediately
    about 160 people signed a petition titled “Help Keep Rick”.  At a well-attended
    meeting on October 22, 2007, the band council refused to reconsider its resolution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
    the applicant and Ms. Shilling began to explore their legal options.  On
    October 19, while Ms. Shilling was attending court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Peterborough as a witness on another matter, she spoke to an unnamed lawyer
    who recommended that she contact Clayton Ruby.  A friend contacted Mr. Ruby’s
    office on October 24 and an appointment was made for October 30 – the earliest
    time slot Mr. Ruby had available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the October 30 meeting, the applicant instructed Mr. Ruby to proceed on two
    fronts – a direct challenge to the band council’s resolution in the Federal
    Court (an application was filed on November 8), and an appeal from the criminal
    sentence.  The reason for the sentence appeal route is the hope that if the
    sentence appeal were successful and the sentence were reduced to a conditional
    discharge, the applicant would have no criminal record.  This in turn might
    encourage the band council to reconsider its resolution since the stated
    foundation of that resolution was that “Rick Hayes is an undesirable due
    to his criminal record”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time the applicant gave instructions to appeal his sentence, the 30-day
    appeal period had lapsed by four days.  Accordingly, this application for
    an extension of time was brought.</p>
  <h3>C.<u> ISSUE</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue on this appeal is whether an extension of time should be granted
    to the applicant to appeal his sentence.</p>
  <h3>D.<u> ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for granting an extension of time is well-known and undisputed.  As
    expressed by the court in <i>R. v. Menear</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 233
    at paras. 20 and 21 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no absolute rule to be applied in the
    exercise of the discretion whether or not to grant an extension of time.  The
    court will, however, usually consider the following three factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    the applicant has shown a <i>bona fide</i> intention to appeal within the
    appeal period;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    the applicant has accounted for or explained the delay; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    there is merit to the proposed appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>In the end, the main consideration is whether the applicant has demonstrated
    that justice requires that the extension of time be granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent does not contest the applicant’s establishment of the first two
    factors in <i>Menear</i>.  Although the respondent could have taken the position
    that the applicant did not show an intention to appeal the sentence until
    October 30, 2007, four days outside the 30-day appeal period, in light of
    the unusual circumstances in this case and the fact that the applicant was
    clearly exploring his legal options almost immediately after receiving the
    resolution, the respondent, fairly, does not advance this argument.  Moreover,
    the applicant’s explanation for the delay – no knowledge of the resolution
    until the day he received it, followed by about two weeks before he met Mr.
    Ruby – is manifestly a reasonable explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent opposes the application solely on the basis of the third factor
    in <i>Menear</i>.  As set out succinctly in the first paragraph of its factum,
    the respondent’s position is:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown opposes this Application on one basis:
    the proposed appeal has no prospect of success.  The trial judge imposed
    a <u>lenient</u> sentence in accordance with a <u>joint submission</u> for
    commercial drug dealing at the pound-level.  There is no ground of appeal
    and no chance of success.  While sympathetic, the Applicant’s case finds
    its remedy in the civil courts, not in a criminal appeal.                                                                                                   [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s argument in support of this position encompasses the following
    propositions.  First, the standard of review on sentencing generally is highly
    deferential: see <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 195 at para.
    48 (S.C.C.).  Second, it was entirely appropriate for the trial judge to
    accept the joint submission regarding sentence: see <i>R. v. Cerasuolo</i> (2001),
    151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 at para. 8 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Third, the sentence imposed for commercial drug trafficking was, if anything,
    very lenient: see Simon Armstrong <i>et al.</i>, <i>Sentencing Drug Offenders</i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2007), at 4-15.  Fourth, collateral impacts, such
    as the subsequent banishment of the applicant in this case, do not justify
    altering a fit sentence and imposing a sentence that would be demonstrably
    unfit: see <i>R. v. Spencer</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 181 at para. 45 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Fifth, the better route for the applicant to attack his banishment is
    by challenging the band council’s resolution as he has done in his recently
    filed application to the Federal Court of Canada.  Sixth, even if the applicant’s
    sentence were reduced to a conditional discharge, thus removing his criminal
    record, this would not likely affect the band council’s decision because
    that decision was based on the fact that the applicant was commercially dealing
    drugs in the community.  Thus, as the respondent puts it in its factum, “[t]he
    legal niceties of the difference between a discharge and a fine are of the
    barest of relevance to his situation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with a substantial portion of the respondent’s arguments.  In my view,
    the sentence was almost certainly fit when it was imposed; it would be nearly
    impossible to dislodge it in a straightforward sentence appeal.  I also think
    that the more direct route to challenge the band council resolution is the
    judicial review application already launched by the applicant in the Federal
    Court of Canada.  Finally, although the respondent’s proposition that the
    band council would not alter its resolution in the face of a new sentence
    of a conditional sentence is in the realm of speculation, it strikes me as
    more likely right than wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    although this is a close case, I conclude that, in the language of <i>Menear</i>,
    “justice requires that the extension of time be granted.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a narrow category of cases in which an extension of time has been granted
    where the consequences of a conviction and/or sentence, not known at the
    time the conviction and/or sentence was handed down, are profoundly disproportionate
    to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Hetsberger</i> (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 154 (Ont. C.A.), Weatherston J.A.
      granted an extension of time to appeal a minor conviction that resulted
      in a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $400, because a later consequence – possible
      deportation –
    was “out of all proportion to the penalty imposed” (p. 155).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly
    in <i>R. v. Gaudreault</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 188 (Que.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Fish J.A., citing <i>Hetsberger</i>, permitted an extension to appeal
    a conviction by a lawyer.  He explained, at p. 191:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Though the delays for appeal have long expired,
    it is relatively recently that Gaudreault learned of a serious and unexpected
    consequence of his guilty pleas.  He became aware only in February of this
    year that the Bar of Quebec had suspended him from the practise of law for
    three months plus one day, beginning January 13, 1992 <i>on the particular
    grounds of his convictions in this case</i>.                                                                           [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that both <i>Hetsberger</i> and <i>Gaudreault</i> involved proposed
    conviction appeals and that the chambers judges found that there was at least
    an arguable ground of appeal against conviction.  The present case is a proposed
    sentence appeal and, in my view, there would be no merit to the appeal if
    it is viewed through the lens of a straightforward appeal.  However, I am
    not persuaded that these differences should control the result in this application.  Both
    Weatherston J.A. and Fish J.A. were clearly moved by what they regarded as
    a “consequence …
    out of all proportion to the penalty imposed” (<i>Hetsberger</i> at 155)
    and “the drastic and unanticipated result of the conviction” (<i>Gaudreault</i> at
    191).  That is the analogy I would draw between these cases and this application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there is a third case directly on point that I find persuasive.  In <i>R.
    v. Litvinov</i>, [1996] A.J. No. 1110 (Alta. Q.B.), Veit J. granted an extension
    of time to appeal a sentence of a fine of $300, a victim surcharge of $125
    and six months’ probation, as well as to seek a conditional discharge because
    the criminal conviction might serve as a bar to the applicant becoming a
    landed immigrant.  Veit J. stated, at para. 3, that “Mr. Litvinov pleaded
    guilty to that offence without consideration for the serious immigration
    effects of entering the verdict; immigration effects may be disproportionate
    to Mr. Litvinov’s culpability.”  She explained the applicant’s situation
    in the following fashion, at paras. 16 and 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not a situation in which the appellant
    contends that the sentence imposed was wrong; manifestly on the basis of
    the arguments before it, it is not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Rather, this is a case where the offender says
    there is a point that I did not mention during the sentence hearing.  I didn’t
    raise it because I did not realize that it was important.  It would be unfair
    if I were not allowed to raise it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    strikes me that the applicant is in a similar position to Mr. Litvinov.  A
    particularly serious consequence of the conviction of the applicant – his
    banishment from his home, business and community – has arisen.  He wants
    an opportunity to persuade this court that, in light of this consequence
    alone (I observe that this is analogous to a fresh evidence application),
    he should receive a different sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that granting an extension of time to appeal a conviction or sentence
    comes at a cost and that such an order “should be made only in exceptional
    circumstances where there is real concern that an injustice may have occurred”:
    see <i>R. v. Closs</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 172 at para. 8 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In my view, this is such a case.  The very short missing of the appeal
    period (four days) coupled with the unexpected and drastic consequences flowing
    from the applicant’s first criminal conviction lead me to conclude, in the
    language from <i>Menear</i>, that the applicant has demonstrated that justice
    requires that the extension of time be granted.</p>
  <h3>E.<u> DISPOSITION</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal is granted.  The
    applicant may file a notice of appeal within seven days of the release of
    this judgment.</p>
