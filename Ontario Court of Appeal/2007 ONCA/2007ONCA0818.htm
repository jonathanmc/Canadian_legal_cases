      our view, in addition to the specific language of Endorsement No. 4, this
      is made clear by the “Follow Form” heading to Endorsement No. 4 and by
      the nature of insurance that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Liberty was providing. As was observed by the trial judge, it makes sense
    that the

    see no merit in the appellant’s assertion that Condition 9 of the policy
    (Maintenance of Underlying Insurance) affects the interpretation of Endorsement
    No. 4. Condition 9 imposes an obligation on the Insured to maintain the insurance
    specified in the Schedule of Underlying Insurances and, in addition, stipulates
    that while failure to comply will not invalidate the policy, the insurer
    will only be liable to the extent it would have been had the policy(s) been
    maintained. In our view, Condition 9 does not alter the coverage provided
    by the policy and therefore does not affect the interpretation of Endorsement
    No. 4.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s interpretation of Endorsement
    No. 4 gives rise to the possibility of a gap in coverage that would be detrimental
    to the insured. In our view, the evidence at trial did not establish the
    policy period of the underlying StopGap insurance. Moreover, even if the
    policy period of the StopGap insurance referred to in the Schedule of Underlying
    Insurance was January 1, 1997 to January 1, 1998, the Schedule referred to
    coverage for the period May 1, 1997 to May 1, 1998—accordingly, there could
    only be a gap in coverage if the Insured failed to renew the specified underlying
    coverage. </p>
