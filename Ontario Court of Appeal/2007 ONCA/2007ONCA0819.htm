  <h4>The Issues</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    issues arise on this appeal.  The appellant submits that the motion judge
    erred in directing the trustee in bankruptcy to convey to Perry Murphy, the
    respondent, a discharged bankrupt, the trustee’s interest in a joint venture
    agreement entered into by Murphy prior to his bankruptcy and the trustee’s
    interest in an action commenced by Murphy to assert his right in the joint
    venture agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also submits that if the motion judge did not err in directing
    the trustee to convey those interests to Murphy, he erred in law in purporting
    to make the order conveying the interest in the lawsuit to Murphy effective
    from the date Murphy commenced that claim even though Murphy was an undischarged
    bankrupt at the time he commenced the action.  The appellant submits that
    the order could not be made retroactive to a date before Murphy’s discharge
    as prior to his discharge he did not have the legal capacity to sue anyone
    in his own name.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h4>The Facts</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent made an assignment in bankruptcy in May 2002.  The bankruptcy
    proceeded by summary administration without the appointment of inspectors.  Murphy’s
    Statement of Affairs made no reference to any joint venture agreement.  He
    indicated that he had an interest in a numbered company, but that his interest
    had been turned over to his business partner, the appellant, Philip Stefaniak
    (“Stefaniak”).  Stefaniak was also a creditor in the bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    before the first meeting of the creditors, Murphy told the trustee that he
    had maintained an interest in the joint venture agreement.  He provided the
    trustee with a copy of that agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    May 2003, the respondent received a suspended and conditional discharge from
    bankruptcy.  The discharge was conditional upon Murphy paying the trustee
    $1,118.00 and the discharge was suspended for five months.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trustee does not appear to have made any inquiries about the joint venture
    agreement until the summer of 2003 when he wrote to counsel for Stefaniak.  In
    September, Stefaniak’s lawyer responded indicating that Murphy had no interest
    in the joint venture or in the corporations referred to in the joint venture
    agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    November 2003, Murphy wrote to the trustee summarizing his efforts to get
    the trustee to address the joint venture contract and its potential as an
    asset in the bankruptcy.  Murphy concluded the letter by asking:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Can someone please
    tell me what is to be the resolve/disposition of this matter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early December 2003, the trustee’s solicitor wrote back to Murphy indicating:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>We reviewed the
    matter of the land development contract with the trustee.  The trustee does
    not wish to pursue any potential claims under that agreement.  It would appear
    that litigation with your partners in the project would be required for any
    recovery.  <u>This would not appear to prejudice your rights to pursue claims
    under this agreement if you wished.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    solicitor’s comments to Murphy indicate that the trustee had determined that
    any costs associated with the pursuit of litigation in connection with any
    rights Murphy had under the joint venture agreement were not worth the potential
    gain to the bankruptcy.  In effect, the trustee decided that any claims arising
    out of the agreement had no realizable value in the bankruptcy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    meaning of the last sentence in the solicitor’s letter is less clear.  Murphy
    was still an undischarged bankrupt in December 2003 and could not at that
    time pursue any claims in his own right.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Murphy
    made the required payment to the trustee in September 2004.  Under the terms
    of the earlier order, he became entitled to a discharge five months later,
    that is in January 2005.  In April 2005 Murphy contacted the bankruptcy court
    office to determine the status of his file. He was advised that order for
    his discharge from bankruptcy had been prepared and that it would be issued
    shortly as soon as the court staff had time to advert to it.  All that remained
    was for the order to be “stamped and issued”. In his affidavit filed on the
    motion, Murphy swears that when he commenced the April 5, 2005 action against
    Stefaniak and numbered companies claiming among other things, fifty percent
    of the profits earned in the alleged joint venture, “I had every reason to
    believe I was absolutely discharged…”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    formal order absolutely discharging Murphy from bankruptcy was issued some
    ten weeks later on June 17, 2005.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stefaniak
    defended the claim by denying that Murphy, as an undischarged bankrupt, had
    the capacity to institute the application.  In correspondence, the trustee
    confirmed that no property or rights in property had been transferred by
    the trustee back to Murphy.  Stefaniak commenced a motion to dismiss Murphy’s
    application claiming that he was without legal capacity to commence that
    action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    Stefaniak’s request, the trustee called a meeting of the creditors in December
    2006.  Only Stefaniak attended.  He attended in his personal capacity as
    a creditor and as proxy for a second creditor.  He asked the trustee to tender
    Murphy’s interest in the joint venture and the lawsuit for sale to the creditors
    subject to court approval.  Had the trustee tendered the asset for sale,
    Stefaniak, the defendant in the action commenced by Murphy, would no doubt
    have attempted to purchase Murphy’s interest in the joint venture and the
    lawsuit, thereby placing himself in control of a lawsuit in which he was
    a defendant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trustee sought the direction of the court.  Murphy brought a cross-motion
    asking the court to direct the trustee to return Murphy’s interest in the
    joint venture to Murphy.  Murphy also asked the court to rectify retroactively
    his commencement of the action at a time when he was an undischarged bankrupt.  </p>

  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge made the impugned order under s. 40(2) of the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”).  That section
    must be read with s. 40(1).  Together they provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>40.(1)  With
    the permission of the inspectors, any property of a bankrupt found incapable
    of realization shall be returned to the bankrupt prior to the trustee’s application
    for discharge.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>     (2)  Where
    a trustee is unable to dispose of any property as provided in this section,
    the court may make such order as it may consider necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    40 is designed to permit a trustee to complete the administration of the
    bankrupt’s estate.  The trustee may do so by returning property to the bankrupt
    where that property is of little or no realizable value to the estate.  If
    the trustee fails to act under s. 40(1), the court may, on motion, order
    the property returned to the bankrupt pursuant to s. 40(2):  <i>Petro Canada
    Inc. v. 490300 Ontario Inc.</i> (1989), 74 C.B.R. (N.S.) 33 (Ont. Sup.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ct.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    return of property to the bankrupt pursuant to s. 40(1) turns on whether
    the property is “incapable of realization”.  Where the asset in issue is
    a cause of action, realization will require the commencement of a lawsuit.  Lawsuits
    cost money and their outcome is almost always a matter of speculation.  If
    a trustee determines that it is inappropriate to commence a lawsuit given
    the potential cost and the potential benefits, the cause of action is an
    asset that is “incapable of realization”:  see <i>Office of the Superintendent
    of Bankruptcy Canada:  Directive Number 22 (Pre-1992) Guidelines</i> at para.
    2(d).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the trustee determined in 2003 that any claims under the joint
    venture would be realized only through litigation and that it was not commercially
    sensible to pursue that litigation.  Nothing occurred between 2003 and the
    creditors meeting in December 2006 which called for any reassessment of the
    decision not to pursue litigation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the December meeting, Stefaniak took the position that the cause of action
    commenced by Murphy could generate some funds for the estate if it was put
    up for auction.  There were two potential bidders, Stefaniak, the defendant
    in the action, and Murphy, the plaintiff in the action.  There was nothing
    in the material before the motion judge to indicate what, if anything, Stefaniak
    was prepared to bid to secure control of the plaintiff’s side of a lawsuit.  There
    was also nothing to indicate whether Murphy had the means to make a bid.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the motion judge recognized at para. 26, s. 40(1) of the <i>BIA</i> gave
    him a discretion to direct that the asset be returned to Murphy:  see <i>Re
    Shelson</i> (2004), 4 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 76 at paras. 29-30 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In exercising his discretion in favour of returning the asset to Murphy,
    the motion judge relied on the following:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    representation made to Murphy by the solicitor for the trustee in 2003 that  Murphy’s
    personal rights to pursue any claims under the joint venture agreement would
    not be prejudiced by the trustee’s decision not to pursue those claims in
    the bankruptcy;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    absence of any evidence that any cause of action arising out of the agreement
    had any significant monetary and realizable value in the bankruptcy.  The
    only evidence available to the trustee came from Stefaniak who insisted that
    Murphy had no interest in the agreement;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    finding that Stefaniak’s request that the asset be sold at auction was designed
    to assist Stefaniak in his capacity as a defendant in that action rather
    than to further the interests of the unsecured creditors, including Stefaniak,
    in the bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    factors identified and considered by the motion judge were all relevant to
    the exercise of his discretion under s. 40(2).  Discretion-driven decisions
    are not reviewable on a correctness standard.  Indeed, it is implicit in
    the recognition of a decision as discretionary one that, in most cases, one
    decision cannot be characterized as correct to the exclusion of all other
    decisions.  A discretionary order will stand on appeal unless it is predicated
    on a misapprehension of material evidence, represents a failure to apply
    the applicable principles guiding the exercise of the discretion, or is unreasonable
    in all of the circumstances.</p>

    motion judge had to consider competing interests.  Murphy, as a discharged
    bankrupt, reasonably expected, based on earlier correspondence with the trustee,
    that any claim he had against Stefaniak would be returned to him post-bankruptcy
    so that he might pursue that claim.  Certainly, prior to his discharge, none
    of the creditors, including Stefaniak, suggested that the trustee should
    pursue any rights under the joint venture agreement.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stefaniak,
    as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy, also had a legitimate interest.  If
    the cause of action was tendered for sale, there was a possibility that both
    Stefaniak and Murphy would bid on securing the right to pursue that claim.  These
    competing bids could generate some money for distribution among the unsecured
    creditors.  There is no evidence as to what amount, if any, could reasonably
    have been expected to have been generated through this process.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the motion judge was obliged to consider Stefaniak’s interests as an unsecured
    creditor, he correctly observed that Stefaniak’s interest as a defendant
    in the outstanding action brought by Murphy could play no role in the exercise
    of his discretion under s. 40(2) of the <i>BIA</i>.  It was no part of the
    motion judge’s exercise of his discretion to seek to advantage either Murphy
    or Stefaniak in the litigation commenced by Murphy.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge made no reversible error in the exercise of his discretion.  Another
    judge may have exercised his or her discretion differently and ordered that
    the action be tendered for sale among the creditors.  The mere fact that
    the discretion could properly have been exercised differently is no basis
    upon which to find that it was exercised improperly. </p>

    now turn to the second issue: did the motion judge err by making the order
    conveying the interest in the lawsuit to Murphy effective from the date Murphy
    commenced that claim even though Murphy was an undischarged bankrupt at the
    time he commenced the action?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the appellant that this aspect of the order is not supported by
    the authority cited by the motion judge, <i>Thompson v. Coulombe</i> (1984),
    54 C.B.R. (N.S.) 254 (Qc. C.A.). That case did not involve an action brought
    by a discharged bankrupt who had failed to obtain an assignment of interest
    prior to commencing the action. Indeed, <i>Thompson</i> and several other
    cases stand for the proposition that an action commenced by an undischarged
    bankrupt is a nullity: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>Long v. Brisson</i> (1992), 3 Alta.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, however, the result reached by the motion judge can, in the particular
    circumstances of this case, be justified by varying the order of discharge
    by dating it April 4, 2005, pursuant to s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>: “Every
    court may review, rescind or vary any order made by it under its bankruptcy
    jurisdiction.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is undisputed that before he commenced the application on April 5, Murphy
    had satisfied all the conditions of the conditional order.  We do not accept
    the submission that a conditionally-discharged bankrupt is absolutely discharged
    as soon as he or she fulfills the conditions of the discharge.  However, the
    conditional order provided that “upon the Registrar being satisfied [that
    the conditions have been met] an Absolute Order of Discharge <u>shall</u><i> </i>issue.” [Emphasis
    added]. It follows that from the point at which he had satisfied the conditions
    in January 2005, Murphy was legally entitled to an absolute discharge within
    a reasonable period of time. On Murphy’s uncontradicted evidence, in early
    April, 2005, the only thing that stood between him and an absolute discharge
    was administrative delay and backlog in the bankruptcy court office. The
    order had been prepared, indicating that the Registrar was satisfied that
    the conditions for the absolute discharge had been met, and all that remained
    was for the order to be “stamped and issued”.  In good faith, Murphy had
    commenced the application having “every reason to believe” that he had been
    discharged from bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    undischarged bankrupt should, of course, wait until he or she obtains an
    order of absolute discharge before commencing proceedings and failure to
    do so will ordinarily be fatal. However, in the unusual circumstances of
    the present case, it is our view that varying the absolute order of discharge
    to show the date of April 4, 2005 is consistent with the interests of justice
    and does not undermine the general principle that an undischarged bankrupt
    lacks capacity to commence legal proceedings with respect to property vested
    in the trustee. </p>

    the motion judge, Murphy argued that the letter amounted to an assignment
    of the interest to him by the trustee.  The motion judge correctly held that
    as an undischarged bankrupt, Murphy did not have the capacity to take an
    assignment and that in any event the letter did not constitute an assignment.</p>
