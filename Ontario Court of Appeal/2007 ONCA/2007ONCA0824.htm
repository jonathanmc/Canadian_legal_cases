  <p>FELDMAN J.A.:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was intoxicated at a Christmas party. Although he was offered a
    ride, he insisted on driving himself home. On the way, he hit two pedestrians
    who were walking on the shoulder of the highway, causing one of them very
    serious injuries. He left the scene and drove the short distance to his home,
    where he was arrested by the police less than two hours later. During the
    course of the arrest, the police found two long guns and ammunition that
    were improperly stored. The accused was acquitted of operating a motor vehicle
    with a concentration of alcohol in his blood in excess of 80 mg. per 100
    mL. of blood and of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. He was convicted
    of impaired driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing bodily
    harm, failing to remain at the scene of an accident, and careless storage
    of firearms. He received a total sentence of three years, six months for
    the driving offences, plus sixty days for the careless storage charge after
    receiving two-for-one credit for fifty-five days of pre-trial custody. The
    appellant appeals his convictions and sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal against conviction on the
    charge of careless storage of firearms, but otherwise dismiss the appeal
    from conviction. I would reduce the sentence to three years and I would set
    aside the DNA order that the trial judge made without giving reasons.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>FACTS</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant, his wife Danielle, and his thirteen-year-old son were guests of
    Bertha and Denis Cormier at their Christmas dinner party on December 25,
    2003. Mrs. Van Puyenbroek drove the three of them over during the late afternoon
    or early evening in their Ford F-150 truck, which the appellant’s son describes
    as silver with a dark blue bottom line. Both Mr. and Mrs. Cormier, as well
    as several other guests at the dinner, observed that the appellant acted
    intoxicated. He was wearing a yellow shirt, red blazer, and cowboy boots.
    He was loud and rude to his wife. When urged to eat, he refused. One witness
    reported that the appellant said that he does not eat and drink at the same
    time. Another witness testified that the appellant said he did not wish to
    eat because he did not want to ruin his buzz. The appellant also began to
    doze off at the table. Because of her husband’s behaviour, Mrs.&nbsp;Van
    Puyenbroek asked one of the guests to drive her and her son home at about
    7:00 p.m. The Cormier and Van Puyenbroek residences are both located in the
    community of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Elk
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake, less than three kilometres apart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      When
    he learned his wife had left, the appellant decided to leave as well. People
    at the dinner observed that he appeared and acted drunk at this point. He
    had difficulty descending the stairs and putting on his boots. He was offered
    a ride home, but he emphatically refused. He left sometime between 7:20 and
    7:40 p.m. When he backed his truck out of the Cormier’s driveway, he backed
    into and through a ditch. A few inches of snow had fallen during the day.
    The appellant drove through town and turned onto the highway towards his
    home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    the meantime, the two victims, Bruce Martin and his spouse, Joanne Langlois,
    who lived in a house on the side of the highway, were out for a walk along
    the highway after their Christmas dinner. It was a clear night. The highway
    was snow-covered but sanded. Mr. Martin walked on the highway proper, while
    Ms. Langlois walked on the highway’s south shoulder, within two or three
    feet of the snow bank. When Mr. Martin realized that a vehicle was approaching
    them from behind, he suggested crossing the highway, but Ms. Langlois thought
    they could stay on the same side because she was wearing a retro-reflective
    construction vest. Mr. Martin agreed but moved directly in front of Ms. Langlois,
    who had moved closer to the snow bank. As a result, they were walking single
    file, hugging the snow bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr.
    Martin described hearing the vehicle making a howling noise as it approached.
    Moments after Mr. Martin stepped in front of Ms. Langlois, he heard a thump
    and he was thrown into the snow bank onto his knees. After first seeing Ms.
    Langlois spinning in the air, he then saw only her snowsuit sticking out
    of the snow bank. He observed the truck up the road. Its brake lights came
    on, then the reverse lights. The truck backed up towards him, then the brake
    lights came on again, the reverse lights went off and the vehicle drove away.
    The truck came close enough to Mr.&nbsp;Martin that he could see a flash
    of yellow in the clothing of the driver. In the meantime, Mr. Martin was
    yelling for help and was yelling Joanne’s name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr.
    Martin was able to get back to his house and Joanne Langlois’ niece called
    emergency services. He and others then went out to assist Ms. Langlois, whom
    they found head-first in the snow in the ditch. She was eventually air-lifted
    to Sunnybrook hospital in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto where she underwent brain and bowel surgery and received further
    treatment until the middle of March, at which point she was transferred to
    a rehabilitation centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Constable
    Colquhoun of the Englehart O.P.P.—the detachment nearest to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Elk
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake—received a call to attend the accident at 7:23 p.m. He was 55 kilometres
    away at the time and arrived at the accident scene by 8:10 p.m. Mr. Martin
    told the officer that a blue Dodge truck struck him, then drove off in an
    easterly direction. Ms. Langlois’ brother told the officer that the appellant’s
    truck made the howling 4-by-4 noise that Mr.&nbsp;Martin had heard. Also,
    the appellant’s son had come over to the accident scene to check what was
    going on, but had left before Constable Colquhoun arrived. The officer found
    a large black plastic housing for the side-view mirror of a pick-up truck.
    After spending 20–25 minutes investigating the scene, the officer drove east
    to the appellant’s house about one-half kilometre away. He went there based
    on suspicion arising from the information he had obtained at the accident
    scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    officer arrived in uniform at the appellant’s house at around 8:35 p.m. He
    observed fresh tire tracks in the snow of the driveway leading to a Ford
    F150 pick-up truck and footprints from the truck leading into the house.
    The officer pulled his own truck in behind the appellant’s truck. He observed
    damage to the right front side of the Ford as well as to the side view mirror,
    consistent with the piece of plastic he found at the scene of the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer then called the OPP communication centre to advise that he had located
    a vehicle with damage that matched the debris at the accident scene. Shortly
    thereafter, Mrs. Van Puyenbroek came out of the door of her house and asked
    Constable Colquhoun what he was doing there. In response, Constable Colquhoun
    asked her who had been operating the truck, and she responded that it was
    her husband and that he had just arrived home. Another officer, Sergeant
    King, then arrived and after briefly conferring, the two officers approached
    the front door of the appellant’s home and knocked.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Mrs. Van Puyenbroek returned to the door, Constable Colquhoun asked her where
    her husband was. She told the officer her husband was in bed. Constable Colquhoun
    said he would like to speak to her husband. According to the officer, Mrs.
    Van Puyenbroek backed off from the front door and gestured that he was in
    the bedroom. Constable Colquhoun assumed this was an invitation to enter
    the house and to follow her to the bedroom, which the officers did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the bedroom, they found the appellant either sleeping or pretending to sleep.
    He had very red, watery eyes, a strong odour of alcohol on his breath and
    a slight slurring of his speech. The officers asked him to dress, placed
    him under arrest and handcuffed him. He refused to put on his boots. The
    appellant was then taken to the police car with no footwear on and read his
    rights. The officers also took possession of a rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun,
    and ammunition, which they found improperly secured in the bedroom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for judgment, the trial judge made the following conclusions
    of law and findings beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the appellant’s truck
    was involved in the incident; (2) the appellant was driving at the time;
    (3) the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; (4) his driving
    was dangerous in accordance with the test in <i>R. v. Hundal</i>, [1993]
    1 S.C.R. 867; (5) his careless driving did not amount to criminal negligence;
    (6) the bodily harm to Mr. Martin and Ms. Langlois was caused by the appellant’s
    impaired driving; (7) the bodily harm caused to the two victims was caused
    by the appellant’s dangerous driving; (8) the trial judge had a reasonable
    doubt on the issue of wanton and reckless disregard for the lives and safety
    of others necessary for a conviction on the charge of criminal negligence
    causing bodily harm; (9) the appellant knew he was involved in an accident
    and left the scene; and (10) the appellant was also guilty of careless storage
    of firearms; (11) the trial judge stayed the two counts of impaired driving
    causing bodily harm based on the principle in <i>Kienapple v. The Queen</i> [1975]
    1 S.C.R. 729.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to three years for the dangerous driving charges
    after giving a credit of 110 days for pre-trial custody, six months consecutive
    for leaving the scene of an accident, and sixty days consecutive for the
    careless storage of firearms. He was also prohibited from driving for five
    years, from possessing a firearm for ten years, and ordered to provide a
    DNA sample.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ISSUES</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the appellant appeals both conviction and sentence. He raises
    the following issues:</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge should have excluded the evidence of the firearms found in the
    appellant’s bedroom as a breach of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right
    against unreasonable search and seizure. The trial judge erred in finding
    that the police were entitled to enter the appellant’s home and bedroom without
    a warrant based on the doctrine of hot pursuit or, alternatively, the consent
    of Mrs. Van Puyenbroek</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the defence expert on accident
    reconstruction and therefore improperly rejected his evidence.</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    verdicts on dangerous driving and impaired driving causing bodily harm were
    unreasonable. There was no evidence that the appellant’s impairment caused
    the accident, nor was there evidence of faulty driving. In the absence of
    evidence of faulty driving, the trial judge improperly shifted the burden
    of proof to the appellant to disprove it.</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge misapprehended the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for the charge
    of failure to remain at the scene.</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence for dangerous and impaired driving causing bodily harm is beyond
    the range for these offences; the sentence imposed for failing to remain
    should not be consecutive; and the trial judge failed to give reasons for
    making a DNA order, as he was required to do under s. 487.051(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ANALYSIS</span></h3>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Issue 1: Was the warrantless
      entry justified based on either “hot pursuit” or consent?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant sought a stay of the proceedings or in the alternative
    exclusion of the evidence of the firearms and the police observations of
    the appellant’s impairment. On this appeal, the appellant seeks only to exclude
    from the evidence the firearms the police found when they entered the appellant’s

      v. Feeney</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 129, the Supreme Court of Canada
      set out the general rule that under the <i>Charter</i>, a warrant is required
      both for arrest in a dwelling house and to legally search a dwelling house,
      in order to prevent unreasonable intrusions on an individual’s right to
      privacy in the home. However, the court confirmed the common law exception
      where the police were engaged in “hot pursuit.” In such cases, “the privacy
      interest must give way to the interest of society in ensuring adequate
      police protection”: <i>id.</i> at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Feeney</i>,
    the court approved its earlier decision in <i>R. v. Macooh </i>(1993), 82
    C.C.C. (3d) 481, on the issue of the hot pursuit exception. In <i>Macooh</i>,
    after having observed the accused go through a stop sign, a police officer
    activated his lights and siren and began pursuit. The officer saw the accused
    accelerate, run two more stop signs, park his car, and enter an apartment
    building. The officer called for the accused to stop but the accused did
    not comply. The officer went to the back door of the apartment and called
    the accused by name. After receiving no answer, he identified himself as
    an RCMP officer, then entered the apartment and the accused’s bedroom, where
    he arrested the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court approved the common law power of officers to enter private premises
    to make an arrest in hot pursuit as a well-recognized exception to the principle
    of sanctity of the home. And for the first time, the court defined the concept
    of hot pursuit by adopting the definition from R.E. Salhaney, <i>Canadian
    Criminal Procedure</i>, 5<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span> ed. (Aurora:
    Canada Law Book, 1989) at 44:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Generally, the essence of fresh pursuit is that it must
    be continuous pursuit conducted with reasonable diligence, so that pursuit
    and capture along with the commission of the offence may be considered as
    forming part of a single transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court also discussed the justifications for this exception to the important
    principle that protects the sanctity of a private home. First, where an offender
    is a fugitive who has gone to his home while fleeing for the sole purpose
    of escaping arrest, when the police come, they are not unexpected or intruding
    on the person’s “domestic tranquility”. Second, from a practical point of
    view, offenders should not be encouraged to run or drive for home to seek
    refuge from the police, creating dangerous situations for members of the
    public. In <i>Macooh</i>, it was fortunate that the accused did not hit anyone
    while he sped to the apartment. Third, the police officer may have personal
    knowledge of the commission of an offence justifying arrest, thereby greatly
    reducing the risk of error. Fourth, flight usually indicates awareness of
    guilt. Fifth, in some circumstances it may be difficult to identify the offender
    without arresting him on the spot. Sixth, evidence of the offence may be
    lost, such as evidence of impairment. Seventh, the offender may again flee
    or continue the offence while the police are waiting for him to emerge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course, the power to enter private premises without a warrant to make an
    arrest is only available where the police already have the power and grounds
    to arrest without a warrant: <i>Macooh</i>, <i>supra</i> at 493–94.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge used the hot pursuit doctrine as a secondary justification
    for the police officers’ entry onto the appellant’s property—which is not
    a ground of appeal—and, as this decision considers further, the officers’ entry
    inside his home and bedroom. The trial judge acknowledged that the hot pursuit
    exception requires a close temporal connection between the accident and the
    police entry, but stated that the time focus should begin at the point when
    the police first arrive on the accident scene. He concluded that in this
    case, “the investigation and pursuit was continuous, diligent, and led in
    a short period of time, about one half hour or slightly more, to arrest.” He
    also found that before they entered the house, the police had reasonable
    and probable grounds, both subjectively and objectively, to arrest the appellant
    for the offence of leaving the scene of an accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes the position that the circumstances of this case do not amount
    to a continuous pursuit, nor do they amount to a single transaction. He also
    says that the police were entering for further investigation and did not
    have reasonable and probable grounds for arrest before they entered the appellant’s
    house. Counsel argued that once Constable Colquhoun spoke to Mrs. Van Puyenbroek,
    he needed a <i>Feeney</i> warrant under s. 529 or s. 529.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> to enter the home and conduct a search. The officer never said that
    he was in hot pursuit, that there were exigent circumstances, or that he
    had any safety concerns. Furthermore, he said he wanted to enter the home
    to speak with the appellant, not that he already had reasonable and probable
    grounds to arrest him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing this ground of appeal, the trial judge was alive to the legal issue
    and articulated the test correctly. There are two issues for this appeal:
    the first is whether the trial judge erred in his application of the law
    to the circumstances in this case. The second is whether the trial judge
    erred in making the necessary finding that the officer possessed both subjective
    and objective grounds to arrest the appellant before he entered the house
    without a warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a case where the officer did not observe the offence himself; instead,
    he had to come from a distance in order to reach the accident scene, and
    he took some time at the scene before heading to the appellant’s home. The
    Crown relies on the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R.
    v. Haglof</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 248, which held that it was possible
    for the police to be in hot pursuit without actually observing the events
    that gave rise to the offence. Although personal knowledge by the police
    was adopted by the Supreme Court in <i>Macooh</i> as one of the grounds justifying
    the hot pursuit exception, the <i>Haglof </i>court noted that in <i>Macooh</i>,
    Lamer C.J.C. also said in <i>obiter</i>, at <i>supra </i>492, that personal
    knowledge was not necessary if the police saw the offender fleeing or continued
    a pursuit already begun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In <i>Haglof</i>,
    the police arrived on the accident scene shortly after the accident. Based
    on information they obtained including a description of the car, they went
    to the home of the car’s owner within 15 minutes. They then spent 29 minutes
    outside the home obtaining further information, which gave them reasonable
    and probable grounds to arrest, and then entered the home, where they found
    a marijuana grow-op. The court held that the events were sufficiently proximate
    to form a single transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the time between the accident and the arrest was about one-and-a-half
    hours, including the time it took the officer to travel to the accident scene,
    which was some 55 kilometres distant. The trial judge chose to exclude that
    travel time from his consideration of the total circumstances in order to
    reach the conclusion that the commission of the offence, the pursuit, and
    the capture of the appellant formed a single transaction, and therefore fit
    within the definition of “hot pursuit.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so doing, the trial judge effectively extended the hot pursuit exception
    to a situation where the officer arrived at the scene long after the offence
    was completed and the perpetrator had left; the officer conducted an investigation
    at the scene; he developed a “suspicion” that the perpetrator of the offence
    was the appellant and for that reason went to the appellant’s home; there
    he conducted a further investigation by observing the truck and speaking
    with the appellant’s wife from whom he learned that the appellant was inside
    the house and had been driving the truck; he entered the home to speak to
    the appellant, and after observing evidence of inebriation, he arrested the
    appellant for impaired driving causing bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other words, the trial judge extended the hot pursuit exception to a situation
    where the officer had no personal knowledge of the facts of the offence or
    the identity of the perpetrator because he neither observed the offence nor
    began or took up any pursuit of that perpetrator. He also extended the exception
    to a situation where the time that had lapsed between the commission of the
    offence and the arrest was one-and-a-half hours. I recognize that part of
    this time was the necessary travel time by the police officer in a northern
    community. However, the effect in this case was that the officer neither
    had any personal information about the offence or the offender, nor did he
    begin or take up a chase or pursuit in the classical sense because the appellant
    was already at home by the time the officer arrived on the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    extension of the hot pursuit exception must be examined in light of the amendments
    to the <i>Criminal Code</i> that now specifically provide for a warrant for
    arrest inside a dwelling house and set out the circumstances when an officer
    may enter a dwelling house without a warrant. Section 529.3 provides:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(1) Without limiting or
    restricting any power a peace officer may have to enter a dwelling-house
    under this or any other Act or law, the peace officer may enter the dwelling-house
    for the purpose of arresting or apprehending a person, without a warrant
    referred to in section 529 or 529.1 authorizing the entry, if the peace officer
    has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is present in the dwelling-house,
    and the conditions for obtaining a warrant under section 529.1 exist but
    by reason of exigent circumstances it would be impracticable to obtain a
    warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(2) For the purposes of
    subsection (1), exigent circumstances include circumstances in which the
    peace officer</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(a) has reasonable grounds
    to suspect that entry into the dwelling-house is necessary to prevent imminent
    bodily harm or death to any person; or</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b) has reasonable grounds
    to believe that evidence relating to the commission of an indictable offence
    is present in the dwelling-house and that entry into the dwelling-house is
    necessary to prevent the imminent loss or imminent destruction of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    opening words of this subsection appear to leave open the common law hot
    pursuit exception to the rule requiring a warrant before an officer can enter
    a dwelling house. Having said that, the section only expressly provides a
    peace officer with the authority to enter a dwelling house without a warrant
    in situations where there exist exigent circumstances. This legislative provision
    is consistent with the Supreme Court’s approach in <i>Feeney</i>, which stated
    that the law provides but a very narrow range of circumstances when an officer
    may enter a dwelling house without a warrant.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no reason, based on the intent of Parliament as expressed in the amendments
    to the <i>Criminal Code</i> following <i>Feeney</i>, to extend the interpretation
    or application of the hot pursuit exception beyond its ambit as described
    by the court in <i>Feeney</i>. It is a necessarily narrow exception. Normally,
    once an officer has reasonable and probable grounds to arrest a person in
    a dwelling place, the officer can proceed to obtain a warrant, including
    a telewarrant if necessary, before entering the home. However, if there are
    exigent circumstances, the officer may proceed without a warrant. If there
    are no exigent circumstances, it is difficult to imagine why an officer could
    not proceed to obtain the warrant, outside of a
    “classic” situation of hot pursuit, in which the officer is literally at
    the heels of a suspect at the moment the suspect enters a dwelling-house: <i>Macooh</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    491.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there appeared to be no justifiable reason Constable Colquhoun
    could not have obtained a warrant to arrest the appellant if he had reasonable

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the officers had “reasonable and probable grounds
    subjectively and objectively to arrest the accused for failing to remain
    at the scene of the accident and were justified in entering the house and
    effecting the arrest, when his condition was noted for impairment causing
    bodily harm.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the trial judge, although there were objective grounds to arrest
    the appellant for leaving the scene, there is nothing in the evidence of
    the officers that suggests that they intended to enter the house to arrest
    the appellant for leaving the scene. The evidence was that Constable Colquhoun,
    the officer who spoke French and dealt directly with the appellant and with
    Mrs. Van Puyenbroek, intended to enter the home in order to speak with the
    appellant, which is what he told Sergeant King and Mrs. Van Puyenbroek. Furthermore,
    once the officers observed the appellant’s apparent impairment, they arrested
    him for impaired driving causing bodily harm. It is unclear whether they
    arrested him for leaving the scene at that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that the reason the officers did not try to obtain a warrant was because
    they were not yet satisfied that they had the grounds to arrest the appellant
    until they spoke to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, based on the evidence of the officers, that the trial judge erred
    in his finding that the officers subjectively believed that they had reasonable
    and probable grounds to arrest the appellant and in his conclusion that they
    were entitled to enter the dwelling-house without a warrant on the basis
    of hot pursuit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also found that the officers were entitled to enter the home
    to arrest the appellant and conduct a search because they entered with the
    informed consent of Mrs.&nbsp;Van Puyenbroek. His analysis is contained in
    paras. 66 and 67 of his ruling on the <i>voir dire</i>:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Also, on the facts as I find them, the officers were
    invited into the house by Mrs. Van Puyenbroek. I decline to accept her evidence
    in this regard and accept instead the evidence of Cst. Colquhoun that she
    by gesture invited them into the house and led them to the room where her
    husband was resting. I accept the evidence of Bertha Cormier as to Mrs. Van
    Puyenbroek’s call to her confirming her knowledge that the accused had hit
    something on his way home and further Mrs. Van Puyenbroek says the officer
    showed her the damage to the truck before they entered the house. It cannot
    in fairness be said therefore that she did not fully appreciate the facts
    and the implications when she allowed the officers in.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Further she at no time told them to leave or stay outside.
    In summation, in my view, the officers were in hot pursuit and therefore
    justified to be on the property and in arresting the accused. In the alternative
    they were invited on the property and a waiver by Mrs. Van Puyenbroek was
    a fully informed one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this analysis, the trial judge appears to accept the principle that in order
    for Mrs. Van Puyenbroek’s consent to have been valid, it must have been fully
    informed consent. As this court stated in <i>R. v. Wills</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C.
    (3d) 529 at 546, in order to be fully informed, the person giving the consent
    must be aware of her right to refuse. See also <i>R. v. Lewis</i> (1998),
    122 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 488 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). There was no evidence or suggestion that Mrs. Van Puyenbroek was so informed
    and no finding by the trial judge on that aspect of the issue. In my view,
    the trial judge’s conclusion on this issue therefore cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding of no <i>Charter</i> breach made it unnecessary for
    him to consider s. 24(2). On this appeal, the appellant seeks to exclude
    the evidence of the firearms the police found when they entered the appellant’s
    bedroom in breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. These were two long guns,
    at least one of which was trigger-locked, but which were improperly secured
    and left near loose ammunition. The appellant concedes that under s. 24(2),
    because the impugned evidence is real evidence, there is no trial fairness
    issue. The issue to be balanced is whether admission or exclusion of the
    evidence would tend more to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
    Although there appeared to be no bad faith by the officers, entry into a
    dwelling-house without a warrant is a very serious <i>Charter </i>breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Feeney</i>,
    where the offence was murder, the court excluded evidence that was non-conscriptive,
    crucial to the Crown’s case, and would not affect trial fairness. The majority
    decision of Sopinka J. emphasized that the unlawful warrantless entry into
    the appellant’s dwelling-house by the police was “a very serious intrusion
    of the appellant’s privacy rights”: <i>id.</i> at para. 81. <i>Feeney</i> thereby
    affirmed the conclusion of Cory J. in <i>R. v. Silveira</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R.
    297 at para. 152, which stated that “to enter a dwelling-house without a
    warrant … constitutes such a serious breach of <i>Charter</i> rights that
    it will likely lead to a ruling that the evidence seized is inadmissible.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the impugned evidence is two long guns and ammunition, which were
    neither illegally owned, nor being brandished. Although any firearms offence
    is serious, the relative seriousness of the careless storage offence in this
    case does not outweigh the need to exclude the evidence so that the administration
    of justice in promoting the sanctity of the home will not be brought into
    disrepute. This court has emphasized that trial courts must give appropriate
    weight to the seriousness of the <i>Charter </i>breach at issue when considering
    the effect on the administration of justice under s. 24(2) of admitting or
    excluding evidence: see <i>R. v. Calderon </i>(2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 481
    at paras. 87–94. In the same vein, this court held in <i>R. v. Sutherland </i>(2000),
    52 O.R. (3d) 27 at paras. 1, 28–34, that an unlawful night-time search of
    a dwelling-house was serious enough to exclude evidence of handguns. As with
    s. 24(2) cases involving illegal arrests and searches of defendants found
    in possession of relatively small quantities of illegal narcotics or monies
    obtained from crime, in the present case, the relative magnitude of the careless
    storage of firearms offence is outweighed by the harm to individual liberty
    and to the administration of justice that would result from admitting the
    evidence obtained from a warrantless search of a dwelling house: see <i>R.
    v. Law</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 39; <i>R. v. Lam </i>(2003), 178
    C.C.C. (3d) 59 at paras. 55–69 (Alta.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Vigneault </i>(2003), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 422 at paras. 57–62 (Q.C.A.).
    I would therefore exclude the evidence of the rifle, shotgun, and ammunition.</p>

    the Crown and defence called expert testimony on accident reconstruction  to
    help the court understand the circumstances of the accident and draw the
    appropriate conclusions on the appellant’s driving. This evidence was necessary
    as there was little direct evidence of the appellant’s driving. He testified
    that he had no memory of the accident.</p>

    he found the evidence given by the defence expert, Mr. Garcia, “so greatly
    lacking as to have little usefulness.” The trial judge then undertook a detailed
    recitation of the problems with this evidence and why he found it so unhelpful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Mr. Garcia premised his findings on tire tracks at the scene that had no
    relationship to the accident. Second, in his reconstruction, he allowed the
    field of view to be contaminated by light emanating from a vehicle parked
    on the north shoulder of the highway facing west with its headlights and
    hazard lights on, whereas there was no evidence of any westbound vehicles
    at the time of the incident. Third, Mr. Garcia’s test vehicle was a mid-sized
    passenger car, with headlights that were lower than those mounted on a truck.
    Fourth, in calculating vision distances, Mr. Garcia did not consider that
    both the truck and the pedestrians were moving in the same direction. Fifth,
    he used statistics derived from a previous test that used a pedestrian wearing
    a white top instead of a retro-reflective vest, and his reconstruction used
    a pedestrian wearing a reflective but not a retro-reflective vest like the
    one worn by Ms. Langlois.</p>

    addition to these discrepancies, the trial judge criticized Mr. Garcia’s
    methodology because it made no reference to the co-efficient of friction
    on a snow-packed roadway or the type of tires on the appellant’s truck, and
    whether either of these factors would have made a difference. He concluded
    that:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>All in all, it was understandable this witness, in cross-examination,
    exhibited nervousness, shaking hands, and a continual rolling of pen over

    of Mr. Garcia’s evidence was not to present an alternative reconstruction,
    but rather to show that any reconstruction cannot be relied upon to demonstrate
    visibility distances, in view of unknown variables such as expectancy and
    vehicle speed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    did not call on the Crown to respond to this ground of appeal in oral argument.
    It is the province of the trial judge to decide what weight to give to every
    piece of evidence. He decided, for cogent reasons that he clearly articulated,
    that he was not prepared to rely on the opinion evidence of this expert for
    any purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, the trial judge gave full reasons for accepting the opinion of
    the Crown expert and for concluding that the appellant had clear visibility
    and ample time and distance to avoid the pedestrians without having to take
    any evasive action. The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred
    by preferring the evidence of the Crown expert and not properly applying
    the principles in <i>R. v. W.D.</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), to
    this evidence. I disagree. In rejecting the defence expert, the trial judge
    concluded that his evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt. There is no
    basis to attack the trial judge’s findings on this evidence.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Issue 3: Were the findings
      of dangerous driving causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing bodily
      harm unreasonable? </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that there was no evidence of faulty driving and no evidence
    that the appellant’s impairment caused the injuries. As a result, the convictions
    on these two counts are unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Andrew</i> (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 120, the British Columbia Court
      of Appeal stated that s. 253 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requires a causal
      connection between the impaired driving and the bodily injury; otherwise,
      Parliament could simply have increased the penalty for impaired driving
      where injury or death ensues. The court described the type of conduct that
      would imply a causal connection as certain driving conduct, a failure to
      react, or a failure to make a certain judgment that contributed in more
      than a <i>de minimis</i> way to the injury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that the appellant had both clear visibility and time to react, the
    trial judge observed that there was no evidence of any reason why the appellant
    would have been unable to stay on the travelled portion of the road. Even
    if there was a fleeting distraction, there was ample time to avoid the pedestrians.
    In assessing whether the accused’s driving amounted to a marked departure
    from the standard of care of a reasonable person in the accused’s situation,
    as required by <i>R. v. Hundal</i>, the trial judge then turned to the known
    facts: the appellant was impaired by alcohol, if not intoxicated, when he
    refused offers of a ride and insisted on driving himself home from the party;
    on his way out, he backed one rear wheel off the side of the driveway and
    into the adjoining ditch, but kept going; nearly 500 metres from the accident,
    he entered a straight stretch of roadway; the weather and road conditions
    were normal for winter, it was not snowing and visibility was good; the pedestrians
    were walking off the roadway proper near the snow bank and Ms. Langlois was
    wearing a retro-reflective vest; the pedestrians were hit with considerable
    force.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these findings, the trial judge concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant’s driving represented a marked departure and went well beyond
    a momentary lack of attention. The trial judge specifically excluded from
    his consideration the evidence of two young men who had observed the appellant
    driving through town on the wrong side of the road, as this evidence suffered
    from certain frailties regarding the date of their observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that he may have had legitimate reasons for driving close
    to the edge of the road inconsistent with dangerous driving, such as to give
    oncoming vehicles more room on a snowy night or in anticipation of reaching
    his driveway. Although there is no onus on an accused, the trial judge was
    entitled to rely on the facts that he did, where there was no other evidence
    from which to draw another conclusion or to raise a reasonable doubt, to
    prove dangerous driving causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing
    bodily harm beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Issue 4: Did the trial judge
      misunderstand the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for the charge of failing
      to remain?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that in convicting him of failing to remain, the trial judge
    was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the appellant
    knew he had been involved in an accident, that he hit something, and that
    he left the scene, but also that he failed to stop with intent “to evade
    civil or criminal liability.” The appellant points to the evidence that Mrs.
    Van Puyenbroek had called Mrs. Cormier and told her that her husband knew
    he had hit something but was unsure what.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. Besides the evidence that
    the appellant stopped and reversed his truck before driving away and that
    Mr. Martin was yelling at him for help, there was more evidence of the appellant’s
    intent and knowledge from his subsequent conduct. The evidence was that the
    appellant drove home and immediately drank more alcohol. It is reasonable
    to infer that the reason he may have done that was to influence any breathalyser
    reading he might have had to undergo. He and his wife had given evidence
    about a toothache he was suffering from, but it was unclear whether he drank
    or avoided alcohol to deal with the pain. In any event, the trial judge rejected
    the evidence of the appellant and of Mrs. Van Puyenbroek as he was entitled
    to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not specifically refer to this section, the Crown also
    relies on s. 252(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>which is applicable
    and provides:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>In proceedings [under this section], evidence that an
    accused failed to stop his vehicle, vessel or, where possible, his aircraft,
    as the case may be, offer assistance where any person has been injured or
    appears to require assistance and give his name and address is, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, proof of an intent to escape civil or criminal
    liability.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Issue 5: The sentence appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues with respect to the sentence: first, that the
    three year concurrent sentences for the dangerous driving causing bodily
    harm convictions following credit for 110 days of pre-trial custody are well
    outside the range for these offences; second, that the trial judge erred
    in imposing a consecutive sentence of six months for the fail to remain charge,
    as the conduct was the same as that involved in the impaired and dangerous
    driving charges; and third, that the trial judge erred by failing to give
    reasons for the DNA order as required by s.487.051(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sentencing the appellant to three years concurrent on top of pre-sentence
    custody on the two major driving offences, the trial judge stated that the
    range suggested by the Crown of three to five years was within the appropriate
    range. However, the case law brought to the attention of this court does
    not bear out that observation. A chart attached as Schedule A to this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Goudreault</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 19, suggests
    that the range runs from conditional sentences to two years less a day in
    prison in circumstances comparable to those in this case in terms of aggravating
    factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel relied on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Barnes </i>(1999), 117
    O.A.C. 371, to support the three-year sentence. However, in that case, the
    charge was dangerous driving causing death and bodily harm. On appeal, the
    court reduced the sentence from three years to two years less a day because
    the trial judge erred in factoring in that the offence was alcohol-related
    when the jury had acquitted the appellant of impaired driving causing death
    and bodily harm. The court stated that in light of the appellant’s prior
    record, he deserved a substantial prison term for the offence of dangerous
    operation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it appears that the trial judge was in error in his understanding of the
    range of sentence that courts have historically been imposing for dangerous
    and impaired driving causing bodily harm, the issue before us on this appeal
    is whether the trial judge erred in the sentence he imposed on the appellant
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s decision on sentencing is one that is accorded the highest
    degree of deference by this court. The trial judge is familiar with the community
    and what is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. The trial judge
    did not err in finding that  a sentence of significant incarceration was
    warranted in light of the circumstances of the offence, including the degree
    of impairment, the nature of the accident and the very serious injuries and
    suffering of Ms. Langlois. Although the sentence of three years may be somewhat
    beyond the range historically imposed in similar cases, I see no error in
    the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also do not accept the appellant’s position that the trial judge erred in
    law by imposing a consecutive sentence for leaving the scene. I agree with
    the trial judge that this offence involved separate conduct for which the
    trial judge was entitled to impose a consecutive sentence. The trial judge
    did not include this conduct when he discussed the reasons for imposing the
    three-year sentence for the major driving offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not err in law in his reasoning, a court is also required
    to review the full sentence imposed and determine whether, in its totality,
    it exceeds the sentence required to meet the sentencing objectives in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. The trial judge noted that the appellant had a previous conviction
    for drinking and driving in 1990, which he said did not have a great deal
    to do with the current sentence, although he considered it. He also referred
    to the appellant’s expression of remorse to a doctor he spoke to in jail.
    In this case, the appellant served 55 days in pre-trial custody. A further
    3 years, 6 months was imposed for the driving offences, for a total—counting
    the pre-trial custody credited on a 2-for-1 basis—of 3 years, 9 and 1/2 months.
    In my view, applying the totality principle, the total sentence should be
    reduced to 3 years after credit for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also asked in his factum that the DNA order the trial judge imposed
    should be set aside because he failed to give reasons as required by s. 487.051(3)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The Crown did not respond on this ground. As
    the section is clear and no basis was argued for doing otherwise, I would
    set aside the DNA order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would reduce the sentence to three years and I would set aside
    the DNA order.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>CONCLUSION</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would allow the appeal against conviction only in respect of
    the careless firearms convictions and set aside the 60 day consecutive sentence
    for those offences, but otherwise dismiss the conviction appeal. I would
    grant leave to appeal sentence and reduce the sentence to three years.  I
    would also set aside the DNA order.</p>
