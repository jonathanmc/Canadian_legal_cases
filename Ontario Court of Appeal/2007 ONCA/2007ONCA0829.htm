line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claimed against Mr. Monforton for professional negligence in effecting
    a settlement on her behalf following an automobile accident.  It was alleged,
    essentially, that he settled the case too soon and for too little.  Her action
    was dismissed by Rady J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is factually driven and we would not interfere with the decision of
    the trial judge, whose findings were amply supported by the evidence.  She
    found that the appellant was motivated to settle early and that Mr. Monforton
    did not fall below the standard of care required of a reasonably competent
    lawyer in settling the case then, and on the terms that he did.  A critical
    consideration with respect to settlement was the potential deductibility
    of disability benefits the appellant was receiving from any award she might
    obtain.  In this respect, and with respect to the standard generally, the
    trial judge preferred and accepted the evidence of the respondent’s experts
    over that of the appellant’s expert, which it was open for her to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Matlack submits that the trial judge erred in qualifying Mr. Torrie as an
    expert on behalf of the respondent.  We disagree.  Mr. Torrie is a lawyer
    who practised litigation for five years but who had concentrated on practising
    as a mediator for ten years before the trial.  He had mediated over 4500
    cases, 70% of which were motor vehicle accident claims.  The trial judge
    ruled that his evidence would be relevant and necessary in addressing the
    issues of the quantum of the settlement and more importantly, the relevant
    legislation and the issue of deductibility and its impact on settlements
    concluded during the relevant time.  We see no error in this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred by permitting the testimony
    of the defence expert, Nigel Gilby, because of a breach of the trial judge’s
    order excluding witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of Mr. Gilby’s testimony, the trial judge became concerned that
    there may have been a breach of the order.  She questioned Mr. Gilby, who
    assured her that he had not discussed the plaintiff’s expert’s testimony
    with Mr. Ledroit.  Subsequently, in his written submissions, Mr. Ledroit
    advised that he spoke to Mr. Gilby on the telephone the same day that the
    plaintiff’s expert completed his testimony and had advised Mr. Gilby on that
    date that the plaintiff’s expert had testified that Mr. Gilby was mistaken
    about the year of a certain article he had referred to in his report.  Mr.
    Ledroit had asked Mr. Gilby to be prepared to address the issue where he
    testified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that she accepted Mr. Ledroit’s explanation, which was
    rooted in his misunderstanding of the terms of the exclusion order.  She
    determined, in the end, however, that the article in question, whenever it
    was published, did not detract from her conclusions in the case.  We cannot
    say she erred in this regard.  The fact that there has been a breach of an
    order excluding witnesses does not operate automatically, as a matter of
    law, to exclude the evidence of the witness in question.  Rather, it is for
    the trial judge to determine, in the circumstances of the case, what impact
    the breach may have had on the fairness of the trial and the weight to be
    given to witnesses’ testimony.  That is what the trial judge did here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs of
    the appeal fixed at $12,500 plus disbursements and GST and taking into account
    the effect of the order of Labrosse J.A. dated April 17, 2007.</p>
