    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence on charges of sexual and physical
    abuse relating to his daughter and physical abuse of his son.  He also appeals
    from the total sentence of six years imprisonment.  At the conclusion of
    the oral argument we only called upon Crown counsel in relation to the sentence
    appeal and indicated our reasons for dismissing the conviction appeal and
    the sentence appeal would be released shortly.  These are those reasons.</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning
    the allegations of sexual intercourse and the complainant’s previous knowledge
    of sexual activity.  The complainant on this count is the appellant’s daughter
    and was ten years of age when the complainant complained to her teacher of
    physical abuse by the appellant.  The complainant was interviewed by the
    Children’s Aid Society and the police and made further allegations of sexual
    abuse including, eventually, sexual intercourse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question that the complainant’s allegations evolved somewhat over time.  However,
    the complainant offered explanations, which the trial judge accepted.  In
    particular, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence that when
    first interviewed, the complainant did not understand the meaning of sexual
    intercourse.  She gave a particularly detailed and compelling explanation
    for this lack of understanding and it was open to the trial judge to accept
    this explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in her reasons relied upon the fact that in her videotaped statements
    to the police that were admitted under s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> the
    young complainant had “extensive knowledge of sexual matters”.  The appellant
    submits that this fails to take into account the evidence of one incident
    of sexual experimentation between the complainant and her brother when they
    were very young and that the complainant had frequently observed the appellant
    and his wife have sexual relations, particularly oral sex and “having sex
    with his penis against her body”.  However, the complainant described much
    more extensive sexual knowledge than she would have gained from her observations.  For
    example, in addition to the complainant’s unusual definition of sexual intercourse,
    she described an activity she called “sliding”, the properties of semen,
    specific sexual activities with the appellant in the bathroom, swallowing
    the appellant’s sperm and washing her face afterwards.  Further, she used
    sexual terminology the content of which could not reflect her observations
    of the appellant and his wife.  The trial judge was well aware of the complainant’s
    evidence about what she observed between the adults and referred to this
    evidence in her reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence concerning
    the allegations of sexual relations and that these findings are supported
    by the evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Use

    appellant submits that the trial judge did not properly deal with the s.
    715.1 statements; that, in effect, she considered those statements separately
    from the complainant’s testimony.  In our view, this is not an accurate assessment
    of the trial judge’s reasons.  The trial judge carefully assessed the statements,
    but she also dealt with the complainant’s testimony.  She observed that there
    were some “odd” features of the testimony due to the complainant’s immaturity
    but that she was satisfied that these features did not undermine the probative
    value of the statements that had been taken three and four years before the
    trial and therefore much closer to the time of the abuse.  This was an appropriate
    approach.</p>

    appellant submits that the verdict relating to the male complainant, the
    appellant’s son, was unreasonable.  The trial judge convicted the appellant
    only of simple assault in relation to this complainant.  She was not satisfied
    that the more serious allegations of sexual abuse had been proved beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  We are satisfied that the conviction was reasonable.  The
    allegation of physical abuse was made immediately to the police when the
    complainant was questioned.  There was only a vague allegation of some sexual
    abuse at that time.  The more serious allegations of sexual abuse came much
    later and in unusual circumstances, with the complainant stating that it
    just “popped” into his head that his father had forced him to have oral sex
    when he was three years of age.  The complainant also displayed a serious <i>animus</i> towards
    the appellant that the trial judge found impacted on his testimony.  There
    was some support for the view that the complainant had been influenced by
    others in the time between his initial complaint and the second more serious
    complaint.  Finally, while there was substantial evidence supporting the
    allegations of physical abuse, there was no other evidence supporting the
    sexual abuse allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave extensive reasons for why she accepted the physical abuse
    allegation, including evidence from the complainant’s mother on this issue.  In
    our view, she was entitled to accept the mother’s evidence on this point
    while rejecting her evidence that would have otherwise implicated her in
    covering up the abuse of her daughter.  The trial judge was not satisfied
    that the other allegations of sexual abuse were made out.  These reasons
    are supported by the record.  The verdicts are not inconsistent and the conviction
    for assault is supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the total sentence of six years imprisonment imposed by
    the trial judge.  He submits that the trial judge erred in principle in giving
    him no credit for the time spent on strict bail conditions.  The trial judge
    gave reasons for not doing so.  She took into account that the strict conditions
    were imposed after the appellant breached a no contact term of his original
    bail and that he waited a considerable time before seeking a bail review
    when the house arrest condition was removed.  More importantly, the record
    does not show that the house arrest condition had any significant impact
    on the appellant’s lifestyle.  From the record, it appears that the appellant
    continued to work at home, he was living with his parents and other members
    of his family and was allowed to leave the house for certain reasons, such
    as treatment for his alcoholism.  We are satisfied that the trial judge did
    not err in principle in refusing to give credit for the time spent on pre-trial
    bail conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the sentence was excessive.  This submission
    was contingent on a finding that the trial judge erred in accepting the complainant’s
    evidence of sexual intercourse.  Since we have held against the appellant
    on that issue, there is no merit to the submission that the sentence was
    excessive.  This was a very serious case of sustained physical and sexual
    abuse by a person in authority.  The abuse began when the complainants were
    very young and, in particular, the sexual abuse of the appellant’s daughter
    began when she was five years of age.  The total sentence of six years imprisonment
    was fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is, however, a technical problem with the sentence.  The trial judge purported
    to impose a sentence of five years imprisonment in relation to count #2 (sexual
    assault on his daughter).  However, that count and count #4 were conditionally
    stayed.  It is apparent that this was a slip and that the trial judge intended
    to impose the five-year sentence on count #3 (sexual interference).  This
    is evident because the sex offender registration order was made in relation
    to count #3.  Counsel for the appellant fairly concedes that this was a slip.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal from sentence is allowed
    but only to the extent that the sentence of five years imprisonment imposed
    on count #2 is set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment is imposed
    on count #3.  The sentence of one year imprisonment consecutive imposed on
    count #6 will stand.</p>
