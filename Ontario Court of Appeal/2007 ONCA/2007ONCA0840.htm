style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of argument, the court dismissed the appeal with reasons to
    follow.  These are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, an Ontario Provincial Police officer, was charged with breach
    of trust.  The Crown alleged that he stole cash from the Whitby Detachment
    while he was in charge of that Detachment.  The charges alleged that the
    theft occurred over a period of about fifteen months.  In convicting the
    appellant of breach of trust flowing from the theft, the trial judge was
    satisfied that the Crown had proved the allegation only in respect of the
    last month of the timeframe alleged in the charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    alleged theft involved cash paid by civilians for various services performed
    by the police, including fingerprint and criminal record checks.  The funds
    were kept in a box at the Detachment.  The appellant would periodically remove
    the funds and related receipts from the box and deposit the funds in the
    bank.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    convicting the appellant, the trial judge indicated that she was not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown had proved that he was stealing
    from the fund throughout the relevant time period.  The evidence indicated
    that through much of the time period, officers working at the Detachment
    had a somewhat cavalier attitude and regularly “borrowed” from the fund for
    various purposes.  The officers would reimburse the funds at some subsequent
    time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was, however, satisfied that the appellant was stealing from
    the fund for the period beginning on April 4 when the police began to actively
    investigate possible thefts from the funds.  The investigation began with
    an audit of the funds on April 4, and continued for about another month.  There
    were several audits during that time period and the money box was under videotape
    surveillance from April 9 forward.  The investigators would count the cash
    in the box and at some point in time began to record the serial numbers of
    the bills.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant alleges various errors in the trial judge’s reasons and also tenders
    evidence on appeal which he submits demonstrates that he did not receive
    the effective assistance of counsel at trial.</p>
  <h4>The Alleged Errors in the Reasons for Judgment</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence of
    his good character until after she had rejected the appellant’s evidence
    as unworthy of belief.  The trial judge’s reference to the character evidence
    does follow her analysis of the appellant’s evidence and her rejection of
    parts of that evidence as incredible.  This does not, however, establish
    that she did not address the character evidence in her analysis until after
    she had rejected the appellant’s evidence.  Reasons for judgment do not necessarily
    replicate the order in which trial judges have addressed the relevant issues.  The
    reasons must be examined in their entirety.  Those reasons demonstrate that
    the trial judge understood the thrust of the character evidence and indeed
    accepted that character evidence.  She concluded, however, despite the appellant’s
    good character, that the substance of his evidence in important respects
    was simply incredible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant next argues that the trial judge did not properly apply the burden
    of proof in that she failed to consider whether the Crown’s case, apart from
    the appellant’s evidence which she had rejected, demonstrated the appellant’s
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The reasons for judgment do not support
    this contention.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I absolutely
    reject the evidence of the accused with respect to the explanations he gave
    for why he destroyed the dash pad receipts and authorization forms, and I
    reject utterly his explanation as to what happened with the dash pad receipt
    money …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    rejecting the explanation, the trial judge went on to say:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I have absolutely
    no doubt whatsoever that the money was received from persons paying for criminal
    record searches, for which dash pad receipts were issued, and which money
    never made it to the deposit list, in fact, was money stolen by Bradley Dunbar.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    these passages from the reasons demonstrate, the trial judge did consider
    whether on the entirety of the evidence the Crown met its burden of proof.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also alleges four material misapprehensions of the evidence.  First,
    he submits that the trial judge erred in holding that the appellant had exclusive
    opportunity to commit the thefts between April 4 and 9.  It is the appellant’s
    position that the Crown proved exclusive opportunity only for the period
    beginning on April 9 when the video surveillance was installed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the appellant that the trial judge was wrong in indicating that
    no one else had the opportunity to take the money between April 4 and April
    9.  This error was not, however, of any significance.  On the unchallenged
    evidence, money was taken from the fund between April 4 when it was counted
    by investigators and April 5 when the appellant purported to count the money,
    record the amount on an envelope and direct that it be deposited.  The amount
    taken corresponded exactly to the amounts represented by the destroyed dash
    pad receipts and corresponding authorization forms.  The appellant acknowledged
    that he was destroying these dash pad receipts and authorizations as of April
    4.  The only sensible inference was that the person destroying the documentation
    was also the person taking the money reflected in the documentation.  The
    fact that others had the physical opportunity to take money from the fund
    between April 4 and April 9 was of no consequence in the face of this line
    of reasoning.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second alleged misapprehension of the evidence arises out of the trial judge’s
    observation that certain money referable to payments for a charity helicopter
    service was not put back into the fund prior to the appellant’s arrest.  The
    trial judge indicated that the appellant intended to repay this money, but
    was arrested before he could do so.  In fact, the evidence was that the appellant
    put the money back into the fund before he was arrested.  This misapprehension
    of the evidence, however, played no role in the trial judge’s analysis leading
    to her ultimate finding of guilt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third alleged misapprehension of the evidence arises out of the trial judge’s
    observation that if, as the appellant testified, the money found in the envelope
    in his desk represented a “float”
    containing money removed from the fund, that one would have expected at least
    one of the bills in the envelope at the time the appellant was arrested to
    match the serial number of at least one of the bills placed in the fund.  The
    investigators had been surreptitiously recording the serial numbers of the
    bills put into the fund for some days prior to the appellant’s arrest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his evidence, the appellant offered various explanations for why none of
    the bills in the envelope contained serial numbers matching the serial numbers
    of bills paid into the fund.  The trial judge accepted some of these explanations.  However,
    it was open to her to draw an inference against the appellant’s version of
    events from the fact that not one of the bills in the envelope bore the same
    serial number as any of the bills paid into the fund.  There was no misapprehension
    of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fourth and final alleged misapprehension relates to the trial judge’s summary
    of the evidence concerning the availability of official receipt books.  The
    appellant kept the official receipt books.  The officer who dealt with the
    public and was directly involved in taking money from the public testified
    that he had difficulty obtaining official receipt books.  Consequently, he
    sometimes used unofficial receipts referred to as “dash pad receipts” to
    record the receipt of monies from the public.  The Crown contended that the
    money reflected in these unofficial receipts was the money that was stolen
    by the appellant and that these unofficial receipts and related documentation
    were destroyed by the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s summary of the evidence concerning the availability of the
    official receipt books accurately reflects the evidence given by the officer.  The
    appellant’s real complaint is that there was other evidence touching on the
    availability of the receipt books that was not specifically alluded to by
    the trial judge.  Trial judges do not have to catalogue the entirety of the
    evidence in their reasons.  The trial judge’s failure to do so does not constitute
    a misapprehension of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    grounds of appeal arising out of the reasons for judgment fail.</p>
  <h4>The Fresh Evidence Application</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that he received incompetent legal assistance at trial.  He
    submits that his trial counsel did not adequately review the disclosure material
    provided by the Crown and did not properly prepare him to give evidence in
    his own defence.  The affidavits filed by the appellant and counsel’s oral
    submissions stress the second of these two alleged failures.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trial
    counsel has filed an affidavit in which he strongly denies the allegations
    made by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and trial counsel were cross-examined on their affidavits.  Counsel
    and the Crown also filed additional affidavit material supporting their respective
    positions.  Not surprisingly, the appellant and trial counsel give very different
    versions of the relevant events.  It is not necessary to resolve these conflicts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. G.D.B.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520 at para. 26, Major J. observed that
      ineffective assistance of counsel claims have two components.  The appellant
      must demonstrate both that counsel was incompetent and that the incompetence
      caused a miscarriage of justice.  The first component is described as the
      performance component and the second as the prejudice component.  Major
      J. further observed that in most cases it is best to begin with an inquiry
      into the prejudice component.  If the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice
      from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, there is no need to
      pass upon the competence of counsel at trial.  This approach is warranted
      because the question on appeal is not ultimately whether an appellant was
      adequately represented, but rather whether the conviction constitutes a
      miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where,
    as in this case, the alleged prejudice relates to the reliability of the
    verdict and not to the appearance of the fairness of the trial proceedings,
    the appellant must show that the alleged incompetence had some negative impact
    on the reliability of the conviction.  Prejudice can be established if the
    appellant can show that there is a reasonable probability that but for the
    alleged incompetence, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A
    reasonable probability is a probability that is sufficiently strong to undermine
    the appellate court’s confidence in the validity of the verdict:  <i>R. v.
    Joanisse</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 at 64 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant may demonstrate prejudice by reference to the trial record itself,
    by evidence filed on appeal, or by a combination of the two.  There is no
    finite list of ways in which the appellant can show a reasonable probability
    that the verdict would have been different had he received adequate legal
    representation.  Where the primary claim is that an appellant was not properly
    prepared to testify at trial, the appellant can demonstrate the prejudice
    by showing, for example, that his counsel failed to elicit certain important
    evidence from him.  The appellant might also demonstrate prejudice by showing
    from the trial record that he was clearly inadequately prepared for cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice in this case.  A review
    of his testimony at trial does not suggest that he was inadequately prepared.  Nor
    has he offered anything that he could have said at trial that was not elicited
    in his evidence at trial.  When pressed in oral argument, counsel submitted
    that trial counsel’s failure to re- examine the appellant on certain points
    raised in cross-examination, prejudiced the appellant.  Counsel could not,
    however, suggest to this court what the questions on re-examination might
    have been and, more importantly, what evidence helpful to the appellant might
    have been elicited from those questions.  </p>

    essence, counsel argued that the cross-examination in certain areas created
    confusion and that re-examination might have cleared up that confusion.  Clarification
    is not always an advantage.  Confusion occurring during cross-examination
    is not always a bad thing for the party being cross-examined, especially
    when the other side carries the burden of proof.</p>

    in the appellant’s affidavit or his cross-examination speaks to what might
    have been done differently had he been more fully prepared to give evidence.  Nothing
    in the trial record suggests any different approach that might have been
    taken.  The appellant’s evidence in-chief and his cross-examination do not
    suggest a witness who was ill prepared or a counsel who was unaware of the
    relevant issues.  They do suggest a witness whose evidence was inherently
    difficult to believe in several important respects.  The problem with the
    appellant’s evidence was not any lack of preparation, but rather the substance
    of parts of that evidence.</p>
