    Potvin was injured while driving a go-kart on a track owned and operated
    by Pineland Amusements Ltd. (“Pineland”).  He lost control of his go-kart,
    he alleges, after colliding with a go-kart driven by his father, Roland Potvin.  Denis
    Potvin’s mother and Litigation Guardian, Barbara Adams, commenced this action
    against Pineland and her husband for damages related to the injuries suffered
    by Denis.  Pineland filed a cross-claim also alleging that Roland caused
    or contributed to the injuries of his son.</p>

    Potvin had an automobile insurance policy with Kingsway General Insurance
    Company (“Kingsway”).  Roland issued a third party claim against Kingsway
    stating that Kingsway had the duty to defend and indemnify him in the main
    action and in the cross-claim by Pineland.  Kingsway issued a statement of
    defence to the third party claim alleging that Roland’s automobile insurance
    policy did not cover the go-kart.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kingsway
    brought a motion seeking determination, prior to trial, whether the automobile
    insurance issued to Roland covered damages for injuries from the go-kart
    accident, and whether it had the duty to defend Roland in the main action
    or in the cross-claim by Pineland.  The determination of both questions turns
    on whether a go-kart is an “automobile”.</p>

    motion judge answered both questions in the affirmative.  For the reasons
    that follow, I would set aside his decision, answer both questions in the
    negative, and dismiss Roland’s third-party claim against Pineland.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    issue is taken with this court’s jurisdiction.  The parties agree that the
    motion judge’s order was final because it deprived Kingsway of a substantive
    right (i.e. to deny coverage under its insurance policy).  Nor is there any
    dispute that the motion judge decided questions of law, which are subject
    to review on the correctness standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties are also agreed that the question whether the go-kart is an automobile
    must be decided by the three-part test set out in <i>Grummet v. Federation
    Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 340 (Sup.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct.), at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) Is the vehicle an “automobile” in ordinary
    parlance?  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If not, then,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) Is the vehicle defined as an “automobile” in
    the wording of the insurance policy?  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If not, then,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) Does the vehicle falls within any enlarged
    definition of “automobile” in any relevant statute?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    affirmative answer to any of these questions leads to the conclusion that
    the vehicle is insured by the standard
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario automobile insurance contract.  In this case, the motion judge decided
    that a go-kart was not an automobile in ordinary parlance and that the definition
    of “automobile”
    in the Kingsway insurance policy did not include go-karts.  These findings
    are not challenged, and the only issue is whether the vehicle falls within
    any enlarged definition of “automobile”
    in any relevant statute.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Enlarged Definition of “Automobile” in Any Relevant Statute</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge correctly recognized that the governing definition was that
    set out in s. 224(1) in Part VI of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I.8.  Part VI deals with automobile insurance.  Section 224(1) defines “automobile”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“automobile”
    includes,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) a motor vehicle required under any Act to be
    insured under a motor vehicle liability policy, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) a vehicle prescribed by regulation to be an
    automobile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that s. 224(1)(b) is inapplicable.  Under s. 224(1)(a) a
    vehicle that is neither an automobile in ordinary parlance nor specifically
    defined to be one under the policy will be an “automobile” if it is required
    to be insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    requirement that a motor vehicle be insured under a motor vehicle liability
    policy is imposed by the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.25<i>.</i>  The motion judge observed that s. 1(1) of this Act
    defines “motor vehicles” as having the same meaning as in the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  The <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> includes
    in its definition of “motor vehicle” in s. 1(1) any vehicle that is “propelled
    or driven otherwise than by muscular power”.  A go-kart is a motor vehicle
    propelled otherwise than by muscular power.  Hence, as the motion judge recognized,
    the question boils down to whether a go-kart is required to be insured under
    a motor vehicle liability policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2 of the<i> Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i> prohibits the operation
    of a motor vehicle “on a highway unless the motor vehicle is insured under
    a contract of automobile insurance”.  As I discuss further below, a go-kart
    cannot be registered as a motor vehicle and cannot be legally driven on a
    highway.  However, it is physically possible to drive a go-kart on a highway,
    and the motion judge rested his conclusion on this physical fact at para.
    24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, it follows that a motor vehicle (which
    includes a go-kart), if operated on a highway, would have to be insured,
    unless regulations under the CAIA exempt such an insurance obligation. However,
    they do not. It cannot be disputed that a go-kart is a motor vehicle, which
    is capable of being operated on a highway. The question of whether it is
    lawful to do so is irrelevant. If operated on a highway, being a motor vehicle,
    a go-kart would require insurance under s. 2(1) of the CAIA. Therefore, it
    is an automobile in my opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant pointed out that any self-propelled vehicle, such as a taxiing
    airplane or a motorized wheelchair, is physically capable of being driven
    on a highway.  The appellant argued that the motion judge erred by considering
    it irrelevant that a go-kart could not be legally operated on a highway.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the appellant’s submission, the point is not that it is illegal to drive
    a go-kart on a highway, but rather that a go-kart cannot meet the legal requirements
    of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> relating to registration, licensing, and
    the equipment of motor vehicles.  Since a go-kart cannot meet the prescribed
    regulatory requirements, it is not possible in law to obtain a motor vehicle
    permit, numbered plates, and evidence of validation for a go-kart under s.
    7(7) of the<i> Highway Traffic Act</i>.  Consequently the appellant argues
    that s. 2(1) of the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>, read in context
    purposively, cannot and does not require that a go-kart be insured by a motor
    vehicle policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle, however, does not apply to this case: there is a difference between
    an illegal act not obviating the motor vehicle insurance regime where it
    already applies and an illegal act invoking the application of the motor
    vehicle insurance regime in the first place.  Put another way, by performing
    an illegal act, an individual cannot make the motor vehicle insurance regime
    apply to him or her to where it would not otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, this case can be resolved on a narrower basis in light of this court’s
    decision in <i>Copley v. Kerr Farms Ltd.</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 346 (C.A.).  <i>Copley</i> addressed
    whether a “tomato wagon”, which fits the definition of “motor vehicle”
    under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, was an
    “automobile” within the meaning of s. 267.1(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  In
    that case, as here, the question boiled down to whether s. 2(1) of the <i>Compulsory
    Automobile Insurance Act</i> required that the tomato wagon be insured by
    a motor vehicle policy.  While the tomato wagon was regularly taken out on
    highways, and in fact the plaintiff intended to take it on a highway later
    on the day of the accident, the accident occurred in the defendant farmer’s
    field.  The court found at para. 32 that there was no requirement for the
    defendant to have it insured “at the time and place where the accident occurred”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Copley</i> makes
    evident that the motion judge erred in basing his conclusion on the possibility
    that a go-kart could conceptually be driven on a highway.  This particular
    go-kart was operated not on a highway, but on a private go-kart track.  The
    question whether the go-kart would require motor vehicle insurance if it
    were illegally driven on a highway did not arise.  The proper question was
    whether it required motor vehicle insurance at the time and in the circumstances
    of the accident.  It did not, and therefore was not an “automobile”
    within the scope of Roland’s automobile insurance policy.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the motion judge, and replace
    it with the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) an order determining the questions of law as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) that the automobile insurance policy issued
    by Kingsway to Roland Potvin does not cover the claim made by Barbara Adams
    in that it does not cover damages for injuries resulting from a go-kart accident
    in the circumstances of this case; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) that Kingsway does not have the duty to
    defend Roland Potvin in the main action or in the cross claim by Pineland
    Amusements Ltd.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) an order dismissing the third-party claim,
    with costs throughout.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would fix costs of the appeal and of the motion below in favour of Kingsway
    against Roland Potvin on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of $12,500
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
