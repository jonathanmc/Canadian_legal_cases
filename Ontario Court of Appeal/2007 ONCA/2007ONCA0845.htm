line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary argument raised by the appellant on this appeal of a committal for
    trial on criminal negligence causing death is that there was no evidence
    that the appellant’s conduct rose to the level of the wanton and reckless
    disregard for the lives and safety of others.  The appellant argues that
    the preliminary inquiry judge accordingly ought to have ordered his discharge
    on the offence charged and only committed him for dangerous driving causing
    death.  Further, the appellant argues that the reviewing judge erred in dismissing
    the appellant’s application for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues arise from an August 7, 2002 collision in which the tractor-trailer
    driven by the appellant tipped over into the northbound lane of Highway 69
    resulting in the death of three people travelling in a northbound vehicle.                                      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There
    was evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry that the appellant was told
    of the trailer’s tendency to lean to the left on corners and that the appellant
    should drive accordingly.  There was also observation evidence that the tractor-trailer
    was being driven in excess of the speed limit and that at times, the trailer
    pitched back and forth from three to three-and-a-half feet off the tractor’s
    line, including onto the gravel shoulder on two occasions, and that the driver
    would have been aware of this motion.  In fact, a driver following the appellant
    passed the tractor-trailer out of concern that it would tip.  Expert evidence
    established the standards expected from commercial drivers and those standards
    required a visual inspection of the rig.  Finally, there was evidence that
    the appellant did not inspect the trailer and about the visibility of the
    trailer’s mechanical condition, including the structure and attachment of
    an added fifth axle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of this and other evidence, the preliminary inquiry judge concluded
    that there was evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed
    could return a verdict of guilty on criminal negligence causing death.  This
    conclusion was upheld by the application judge on the <i>certiorari</i> application.  We
    see no basis upon which to interfere with that result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    an application to review an order to stand trial, the standard of review
    is extremely limited.  There need only be some evidence upon which the preliminary
    inquiry judge could form an opinion that the evidence was sufficient to justify
    the committal.  As it is sometimes put, there need only be a scintilla of
    evidence.  Evidence that the appellant drove above the speed limit going
    into a curve while knowing of the trailer’s tendency to lean and of the obvious
    poor condition of the trailer was sufficient to meet the scintilla of evidence
    standard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also raises a related ground of appeal based on the sufficiency
    of the reasons of the preliminary inquiry judge.  In our view, those reasons
    were sufficient to explain to the appellant why he was being committed for
    trial on the basis of the total of the evidence considered by the preliminary
    inquiry judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.   </p>
