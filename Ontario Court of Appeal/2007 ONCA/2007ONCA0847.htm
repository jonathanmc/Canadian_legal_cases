line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GCNA
    insured Baig’s 1999 BMW M3 convertible beginning in 2002.  The insurance
    included OPCF-19A coverage, which insures the vehicle for a specified value.  To
    obtain such coverage, Baig submitted an appraisal report signed by Giilck
    of Discount Appraisals.  Upon receiving the appraisal, GCNA provided Baig
    with an OPCF-19A endorsement on the vehicle in the amount of $71,300.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    vehicle was damaged in a collision on December 10, 2004.  Baig submitted
    a Proof of Loss to GCNA claiming the full amount specified in the OPCF-19A
    endorsement.  The Proof of Loss indicated the vehicle had been purchased
    on February 23, 2002, for $12,500 US “as per salvage price”.  As well, GCNA
    had learned that Giilck was the common-law partner of Baig and that together
    they operated Discount Appraisals.  </p>

line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GCNA
    required Baig to attend an examination under oath pursuant to Statutory Condition
    6(4) on April 6, 2005.  Baig attended with counsel who refused to allow GCNA
    to ask any questions about how the amount in the appraisal had been determined.  He
    took the position that the examination was restricted to the particulars
    of the claim and did not extend to the appraisal report, which he regarded
    as a prior underwriting event.  Consequently, no questions were answered.</p>

    May 27, 2005, Baig commenced an action against GCNA claiming damages for
    loss of the automobile together with punitive, exemplary, and aggravated
    damages of $100,000 each.  On June 29, 2005 GCNA filed a statement of defence
    alleging that the appraisal prepared by Discount Appraisals had been greatly
    overstated due to the poor condition of the BMW at the time, and that Baig,
    Giilck, and Discount Appraisals had misrepresented the value of the BMW.  The
    appellant counterclaimed against Baig, Giilck, and Discount Appraisals for
    misrepresentation and detrimental reliance.</p>

    appellant brought a motion for an order compelling Baig to attend to be examined
    under oath pursuant to Statutory Condition 6(4) and to answer questions relating
    to the initial valuation of his vehicle.  In response Baig, Giilck, and Discount
    Appraisals sought summary judgment dismissing the counterclaim.</p>

      motion judge observed that the statutory examination under oath was redundant
      because GCNA had the right to examine Baig for discovery in the lawsuit.  He
      took the view that once the relationship between an insurer and an insured
      becomes adversarial, or at least once a lawsuit is commenced, the examination
      under Statutory Condition 6(4) is no longer available to the insurer.  He
      explained at para. 25 that once the relationship became adversarial “the
      insurer…forfeited its right to an examination under oath.  To allow otherwise
      would be an abuse of the insured’s duty to cooperate.</span>  It would
      compel him to assist the insurer in mounting a defence to his claim.”</p>

      motion judge also took the view that GCNA’s attempt to question Baig on
      the initial valuation of the vehicle was beyond the scope of the examination
      under Statutory Condition 6(4).  He said at para. 21:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose
    of an examination under oath is to assist the insurer in the investigation
    of the claim. When considering the reference to “matters in question” in
    section 6(4), the whole of section 6 must be taken into account. The focus
    of section 6 is the claim.  An examination under oath, therefore, under section
    6(4) is restricted to the claim presented by the insured under section 6(1).  The
    insured has a duty to cooperate with the insurer but has no obligation to
    answer questions as to underwriting.  If the examination was intended to
    be used for purposes of other than investigating the claim, the statutory
    provision would have specifically addressed such matters. </p>

    motion judge granted summary judgment dismissing GCNA’s counterclaim against
    Giilck and Discount Appraisals.  He noted that GCNA, in its statement of
    defence, pleaded that the only reason it had denied Baig’s claim was his
    failure to respond to proper questions at the examination under oath pursuant
    to Statutory Condition 6(4).  He reasoned that since Giilck and Discount
    Appraisals were not implicated in Baig’s refusal to be examined under oath,
    there could be no basis for the counterclaim against the other two defendants.</p>

      do not agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that Statutory Condition
      6(4) ceases to apply once the relationship between the insurer and the
      insured becomes adversarial or when litigation is commenced.  There are
      no words in the provision that indicate an insurer’s right to examine an
      insured is limited to the situation in which their relationship is not
      adversarial.  In my view, the Statutory Condition must be applied according
      to its plain terms.  An insured cannot evade the plain requirement to submit
      to an examination by the simple expedient of commencing an action.  </span></p>

      motion judge was concerned that an examination pursuant to the statutory
      condition would be redundant, given the right of examination for discovery
      in the civil action.  Therefore, he found the statutory condition ceases
      to operate once litigation has commenced.  However, finding the statutory
      condition ceases to operate is unnecessary in order to avoid any redundancy,
      even if mere redundancy allowed a court to find legislation inoperative.  Redundancy
      can be avoided because the court, in controlling its own procedures, is
      able to consider questions that have already been asked and answered on
      a statutory examination improper on a subsequent examination for discovery.  The
      fact that an insurer has the right to a statutory examination and an examination
      for discovery does not mean the insured must answer the same questions
      twice.  The insured may be required to attend twice, but that is a consequence
      of clear legislation.</span></p>

      motion judge took the view that the scope of the statutory examination
      was limited to Baig’s claim for insurance benefits.  In his view GCNA had
      agreed to the value of the vehicle when the policy was issued; accordingly,
      its value was not a “matter in question” in respect of Baig’s claim for
      benefits when the vehicle was damaged two years later.  He concluded that
      questions regarding the original application for insurance and the underwriting
      issues were not
    “matters in question” and therefore beyond the scope of the examination. </span></p>

      for the respondent conceded that whether the initial appraisal of the vehicle
      was fraudulent is a matter that was relevant to GCNA’s defence to Baig’s
      action.  The concession is appropriate.  When Baig’s action reaches trial,
      the alleged fraudulent appraisal would be relevant to the court’s determination
      whether he is entitled to damages because GCNA wrongfully refused to pay
      him insurance benefits.  If the question is relevant to the determination
      of GCNA’s liability at trial, I fail to understand how it would not be
      relevant to GCNA’s decision whether or not to pay the claim.  The purpose
      of the statutory examination is to provide GCNA with the opportunity to
      examine the insured in regard to the matters that might properly affect

      recognize the force of counsel for Baig’s submission that taking a broad
      view of the scope of the statutory examination could provide insurers with
      the opportunity to conduct baseless reviews of the underwriting of the
      insurance contract in an effort to find a basis to refuse claims.  Undoubtedly,
      the statutory examination is not intended to permit insurers to embark
      on fishing expeditions or to take blind shots in the dark.  However, where
      the insurer has an objective and reasonable basis for suspecting fraud
      in the initial appraisal, questions about the matter are relevant.</span></p>

    first reason he offered for doing so was that GCNA had limited its defence
    to Baig's claim to his failure to attend for the statutory examination.  In
    my view, the motion judge erred in understanding the counterclaim to be limited
    by the statement of defence.  As stated in the annotated<i> Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> in James J. Carthy, W.A. Derry Millar &amp; Jeffrey G. Cowan, <i>Ontario
    Annual Practice 2007-2008</i> (Aurora, Ont: Canada Law Book, 2007) at 831 &quot;<i>counterclaims
    are independent actions </i>which generally are tried with the main action
    unless to do so would unduly complicate, delay or prejudice the main action

line-height:normal;'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the counterclaim independently pleaded damages for breach of contract
    and negligence based on statements that Baig, Giilck, and Discount Appraisals “colluded
    and conspired”, that they “submitted an appraisal report... knowing that
    the contents of the same was not true&quot;, and that they “knew ought to
    have known that the appraisal report... would induce The Guarantee Company
    to issue a policy... in the amount indicated&quot;.  GCNA had made similar
    claims in the statement of defence and pleaded that &quot;Further and, in
    the alternative, the defendant states that the plaintiff, Rehman Baig, and/or
    Discount Auto Appraisals and/or LeeAnn Giilck were negligent in providing
    the appraisal that induced the defendant to issue the OPCF 19A endorsement.&quot;</p>

    I read it, the counterclaim advanced an independent claim against Giilck
    and Discount Appraisals in the event GCNA's defence to Baig's claim failed.  The
    motion judge had to consider whether there was a genuine issue for trial
    of the counterclaim based on the evidence in the record.  The motion judge
    disapproved of counsel of record for swearing the affidavits GCNA tendered
    on substantive issues and found those affidavits to be deficient in that
    they merely relied on the allegations contained in the pleadings.  </p>

    even if GCNA's affidavits are disregarded, Giilck and Discount Appraisals
    bore the initial onus of proving that there was no genuine issue for trial.
    They did not do so.  They merely relied on the alleged inconsistency between
    GCNA’s defence to Baig's action and its counterclaim against them.  Giilck
    and Discount Appraisals did not tender any evidence at all.  While it is
    clear that the responding party “must lead trump or risk losing”, this court
    held in <i>Hi-Tech</i> <i>Group Inc. v. Sears Canada Inc.</i> (2001), 52
    O.R. (3d) 97 at para. 30, that “[f]ailure of the responding party to tender
    evidence does not automatically result in summary judgment.”  In this case,
    the failure of Giilck and Discount Appraisals to adduce any evidence that
    there was no genuine issue for trial was fatal to their motion.</p>
