line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the appellant’s trial before a Superior Court judge, the principal controversy
    had to do with the validity of two search warrants that authorized search
    for and seizure of treatment records and blood samples at a local hospital.  The
    records were compiled and blood samples taken by hospital staff on the appellant’s
    arrival at the hospital shortly after he had been involved in a motor vehicle
    accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    informant for both warrants was a provincial constable who had responded
    to an emergency call to the accident scene.  After a brief preliminary investigation,
    the officer drove to the hospital where he saw emergency room staff examining
    and treating the appellant.  At the accident scene, the officer had noticed
    that the appellant had injuries to his lower body and was belligerent with
    emergency workers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    informant returned to the accident scene where he learned that the speedometer
    of the car driven by the appellant had locked at 140 km/h.  He noticed an
    empty beer bottle and beer carton in the interior of the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the informant resumed his regular police duties later on October 28, 2001,
    he spoke with a probationary constable who had seen the appellant at a wedding
    reception within an hour before the accident.  The probationary constable
    told the informant that he (the probationary constable) had seen the appellant
    make several trips to the bar at the wedding reception and had last seen
    the appellant, drink in hand, standing unsteadily at the bar.  The appellant
    appeared to be under the influence of alcohol.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 31, 2001, the informant confirmed with a hospital employee that all
    health records about the treatment that the appellant had received at the
    hospital after the accident were kept in the Health Records Department of
    the hospital.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 1, 2001, the informant sought and obtained a warrant to search for
    and seize the appellant’s medical records indicating the treatment that the
    appellant had received at the hospital “due to a motor vehicle accident on
    the 28<sup>th</sup> October 2001”.  The warrant was executed on the date
    it was issued.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the information obtained on execution of the first warrant and
    discussions with a laboratory technician in the Biochemistry Department of
    the hospital, the informant sought and obtained a second warrant to search
    for and seize blood samples taken from the appellant, as well as documents
    relating to the care, custody or control of those samples.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant sought to exclude the results of the toxicological analysis
    of the blood sample taken from him at the hospital.  The evidentiary basis
    for the challenge consisted of the relevant warrants, informations to obtain
    the warrants, and a transcript of the informant’s evidence at the preliminary
    inquiry into the charges then outstanding against the appellant.  No <i>viva</i> <i>voce</i> evidence
    was adduced on the admissibility inquiry, nor did the appellant seek leave
    to cross-examine the informant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant renewed his claim of constitutional infringement on appeal.  Mr.
    Sheppard contended that the information to obtain the first warrant failed
    to disclose a basis upon which the justice of the peace could reasonably
    conclude that the conditions precedent to the issuance of the search warrant
    under s. 487(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> had been met.  According
    to Mr. Sheppard, the information to obtain this warrant contained nothing
    upon the basis of which the justice could find that there were reasonable
    grounds to believe: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>i.          that the appellant had committed any offence listed in the
    warrant, in particular, a breach of section 253(a) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>;
    and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>ii.         that the medical records relating to the appellant’s treatment
    would afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence, in particular
    that blood samples had been taken from the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to either submission advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test the trial judge was required to apply in determining the complaint of
    constitutional infringement raised by the appellant at trial was whether
    there was reliable evidence in the sworn information before the justice that
    might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the justice <i>could</i> have
    granted the warrant.  The test was <i>not</i> whether, in the reviewing judge’s
    opinion, the warrants <i>should</i> have issued, much less whether the reviewing
    judge would have issued the warrants himself if asked.  See <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421 at p. 1452 <i>per</i> Sopinka J.; and, <i>R. v. Araujo</i> (2000),
    149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at p. 473 <i>per</i> LeBel J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there was reliable evidence before the issuing justice that might
    reasonably be believed upon which the justice could conclude that there were
    reasonable grounds to believe the appellant had committed a driving offence
    described in the information, in particular, an offence contrary to s. 253(a)
    of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.  The essential finding, which required
    no determination that the appellant was “at fault” for the accident, was
    amply supported by the cumulative effect of evidence of:</p>

    empty beer bottle in the passenger compartment of the vehicle driven by the
    appellant and an empty case of beer in the trunk;</p>

    excessive speed at which the appellant’s vehicle was apparently travelling,
    nearly 50 km per hour in excess of the posted speed limit; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>vi.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    observations of the probationary constable who had seen the appellant at
    a wedding reception within an hour preceding the accident, and noticed that
    the appellant was unsteady on his feet, apparently under the influence of
    alcohol, and had made several trips to the bar area at the wedding reception.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also of the view that the supportive information disclosed reliable evidence
    that might reasonably be believed upon which the issuing justice could conclude
    that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant’s medical
    treatment records would provide evidence of the appellant’s impairment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    informant described the medical treatment administered to the appellant at
    the hospital and the nature of the injuries the appellant had apparently
    suffered.  The officer later confirmed that all health records concerning
    the appellant’s treatment at the hospital had been retained in its appropriate
    Health Records Department.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the informant, the doctors examining the appellant at the hospital were
    concerned about back injuries.  The appellant had been thrown from the vehicle.  The
    issuing justice was entitled to draw the inference, at the least from the
    material contained in the information if not from everyday experience, that
    a routine hospital procedure in the treatment of accident victims whose serious
    injuries have not yet been determined is to take a blood sample for medical
    and hospital purposes.  See <i>R. v. Katsigiorgis</i> (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d)
    256 (Ont.

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the parties argued their respective positions on a basis that included
    the evidence given by the informant at the preliminary inquiry.  There, the
    officer confirmed the presence of a laboratory technician in the room in
    which the appellant was being treated.  The technician was carrying “a standard
    small tray … which has got viles [<i>sic</i>] on them …”  The informant also
    gave evidence that, in his experience, hospitals usually screened blood samples
    routinely taken from accident victims for the presence of alcohol.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was reasonable for the issuing justice to infer that the appellant’s medical
    treatment records would indicate the existence of a blood sample, and that
    such a sample would be screened routinely for alcohol or drugs that might
    have an effect on any medication that might subsequently be administered.  Neither
    would it have been unreasonable for the issuing justice to infer that the
    treatment records may well include other evidence.  After all, the phrase “evidence
    with respect to the commission of an offence” in s. 487(1)(b) includes anything
    relevant or rationally connected to the incident under investigation.  See <i>CanadianOxy
