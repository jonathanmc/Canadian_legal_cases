    is the mother’s milk of politics”, says the respondent Blair Longley, leader
    of the Marijuana Party of Canada.  The individual and political party respondents
    want more of it from the public purse.  They say that the current regime
    for the regulation and public support of registered political parties under
    the <i>Canada Elections Act</i> unconstitutionally deprives them of financial
    benefits available to larger political parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amongst
    the array of benefits available to registered political parties is the right
    of those that obtain more than 2% of the vote nationally in a general election,
    or 5% of the total votes cast in the constituencies where they run candidates,
    to receive direct public financing in the amount of $1.75 for every vote
    cast, indexed, and payable quarterly.  The constitutionality of those thresholds –
    found in s. 435.01(1) of the <i>Act</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> – is
    the primary issue on this appeal.  Additional issues involve the remedies
    imposed and rejected by the application judge (who found that the thresholds
    violated ss. 3 and 15 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>),
    and his interpretation of s. 504 of the <i>Act</i> (which deems a political
    party or association, in certain circumstances, to be a “person”).</p>

line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Attorney General of Canada seeks to set aside the judgment of Matlow J.,
    dated October 12, 2006.  In that judgment Justice Matlow ruled that the provisions
    of s.&nbsp;435.01(1) infringed ss. 3 and 15 of the <i>Charter</i>, that those
    infringements could not be saved by s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>, and that
    the language of s. 435.01(1) should, by operation of the remedies of severance
    and reading in, be read to provide a minimum threshold of “one vote” for
    qualification for receipt of the quarterly allowances.  He ordered the Receiver
    General for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to pay quarterly allowances to the six party respondents retroactively to
    January 1, 2004, plus pre-judgment interest, in the total amount of $567,435.60.  He
    also ruled that s. 504(a) of the <i>Act</i> gave political parties standing
    to sue in their own name and to claim s. 3 and s. 15 <i>Charter </i>rights
    on behalf of their individual members.</p>

    Matlow rejected the respondents’ claims for (a) damages in the amount of
    $100,000 for each claimant for loss of political opportunities suffered as
    a consequence of the respondent political parties not receiving quarterly
    allowances, and (b) punitive damages in the amount of $500,000 for each claimant.  The
    respondents cross-appeal from the dismissal of those claims.</p>

    once a party has been registered, it becomes entitled to an initial set of
    benefits of both an informational and financial nature.  The party is recognized
    as a registered political party under the <i>Act</i> and its name and logo
    are protected.  Its party affiliation is placed on the ballot beside the
    name of each candidate running for the party.  The party is entitled to an
    allocation of free broadcasting time, and to an allocation of guaranteed
    broadcasting time at the lowest commercial rate.  Importantly, it is able
    to raise funds through the political contribution tax credit regime by issuing
    receipts for contributions received throughout the year, and it is able to
    receive any surplus funds from election campaigns of its individual candidates
    following an election.</p>

    once a registered political party meets one of two measures of electoral
    success – obtaining 2% of the national vote or 5% of the total of all votes
    cast in the constituencies in which it runs candidates – it is entitled to
    an additional set of measures of public funding:</p>

    1974, the <i>Election Expenses Act</i>, S.C. 1974, c. 51, introduced unique
    measures of public funding for political parties, chiefly by amending the <i>Act </i>and
    the <i>Income Tax Act</i>.  In exchange, parties and candidates were required
    to accept certain spending limits and new reporting obligations.  At the
    time, measures of public funding for political parties were not provided
    on a tiered basis.  Rather, once registered, a party was generally entitled
    to all measures of public funding then available.  The threshold for becoming
    and remaining a registered political party was high, however, as, among other
    things, a party had to run at least 50 candidates in a general election unless
    it was represented in the House of Commons by 12 or more members.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;"Times New Roman";'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  </p>

    provisions remained in place, essentially, until the mid-1990s.  Following
    the 1993 General Election, however, there was agitation for a change in the
    requirements relating to the reimbursement of election expenses.  The primary
    catalyst for this development was the Natural Law Party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Natural Law Party was part of an international transcendental meditation
    movement.  It promoted, amongst other things, the benefits of transcendental
    meditation (or
    “yogic flying”, as it was called).  In the 1993 election, it fielded over
    200 candidates, received approximately 85,000 votes (or, 0.6% of the national
    vote), and was rewarded with a total of $717,000 in public funds as reimbursement
    for its election expenses.  Parliamentarians and members of the public were
    dismayed.  The perception was that the Natural Law Party had not participated
    in the election for the purpose of engaging in political discourse and enhancing
    the political process; rather, its purpose was to advertise its contemplative
    lifestyle, promote its fee-based meditation courses and enhance its commercial
    aims.  It hired people to “run” on its behalf.  People were naturally concerned
    about the use of public funds to support such a campaign.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, Mr. Ian McClelland, MP (Reform Party of Canada) introduced a private
    members bill in the House of Commons with a view to establishing an eligibility
    threshold for partial reimbursement of a party’s election expenses.  It proposed
    that a registered party would have to receive 2% of the national vote before
    it would be entitled to such a reimbursement.  After consideration by the
    House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the Bill
    was enacted in October, 1996, with its threshold of 2% of the national vote
    or 5% of the votes cast in electoral districts in which the party ran candidates
    (the threshold that now applies, as well, to the payment of quarterly allowances).  At
    the time, a party still had to run at least 50 candidates in an election
    to be registered.</p>

    significant changes were made to the regime for public funding of political
    parties in 2003 with the enactment of Bill C-24.  The modifications were
    in response to public concerns over the possible undue influence on elected
    officials stemming from large contributions from corporations, unions and
    wealthy individual donors.  The new legislation imposed sweeping limits on
    all private financial contributions to political parties; it also introduced
    three measures of public funding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    introduced annual allowances whereby parties can receive, on a quarterly

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    last measure – the benefit at issue in this appeal
    – was premised on the party meeting the same threshold that had previously
    been implemented in respect of the partial reimbursement of election expenses,
    namely that the party obtain 2% of the national vote or 5% of the total votes
    cast in the constituencies in which it runs candidates.  It appears from
    the legislative history that Parliament, in employing the same threshold,
    adopted its previous rationale as applicable to the thresholds for partial
    reimbursement of election expenses in 1996.  This is indicated by the statements
    of the Minister responsible for the introduction of Bill C-24 (Don Boudria)
    and the statements of the Chief Electoral Officer (Jean-Pierre Kingsley)
    before the House Standing Committee and the Senate Standing Committee dealing
    with the Bill.  For example, Mr. Boudria told the Senate Standing Committee
    on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>If taxpayers’ dollars are dispensed for the purpose of giving
    a reimbursement after an election based on the 2 per cent and 5 per cent
    criteria, it stands to reason that the same criteria for dispensing of public
    dollars on the annual system of $1.75 should be based on the identical threshold. […]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>We had to establish a cut-off at some point.  We made our choice based
    on the case we have currently before the Supreme Court<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]</span></span></span></a> and
    on the decisions of lower courts. The 2 per cent and 5 per cent is reasonable
    and proper in terms of getting the funding back after an election [in the
    context of expense reimbursement].  Therefore, it is equally reasonable and
    proper to get the funding back during, generally, non-election years when
    you use $1.75 for the continued sustenance of political parties.  That is
    the logic under which we have operated for this.<a href="#_ftn10"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The new allowances
    to political parties would be tied directly to the level of popular support
    they received in the most recent general election.  At the same time, minimum

    ’s public funding regime for political parties occurred in 1990.  The 1990

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s Constitutional Council ruled the latter threshold unconstitutional.  Public
    funding became available with no vote-based threshold in place, and from
    1990 to 2003 the number of registered political parties increased from 29
    in 1990 to 244 in 2003.  The number peaked at 316 in 1999.  There was some
    concern that groups were being formed solely for the purpose of accessing
    public funding.  Interestingly, the Natural Law Party was amongst the newly
    registered parties.  Thresholds were re-introduced in 2003 to take effect

    agree that the thresholds at issue here are somewhat different than the 50-candidate
    threshold for political party registration at issue in <i>Figueroa</i>.  I
    also agree that the application judge erred in not conducting a fresh analysis
    based on the circumstances before him.  However, he did consider the implications
    and effect of <i>Figueroa</i> and, in any event, my own analysis leads me
    to the conclusion that <i>Figueroa</i> and the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    subsequent decision in <i>Harper</i>,<i> supra</i>, leave little doubt that
    the s. 435.01(1) thresholds contravene s. 3 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

    the <i>Act</i>, unlike before, now provides public support and financing
    to political parties on a tiered basis.  The candidate threshold for party
    registration has been reduced from 50 to one.  All parties receive significant <i>initial</i> measures
    of public support.  Meeting the thresholds simply opens the door to <i>additional</i> measures
    of support such as quarterly allowances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the <i>Figueroa</i> decision, the 50-candidate threshold determined
    whether an organization would have access to registered political party status,
    and to the benefits attending that status, on an all or nothing basis.  Those
    benefits included the right to issue tax receipts for contributions made
    between election campaigns, the right to transfer unspent election funds
    from the candidate to the party, and the right to list party affiliation
    next to a candidate’s name on the ballot paper.  Here, on the other hand,
    under the new registration regime that has been established, there are very
    limited requirements for attaining registered party status – principally,
    one candidate, 250 supporters, and a simple declaration from the party leader
    to the effect that one of the party’s purposes is to participate in public
    affairs
    – and the impugned thresholds screen only for the additional public funding
    benefits.  </p>

    counsel for the Attorney General argue that the s. 435.01(1) thresholds are
    very low (2% and 5% of voter support) as compared to the 50-candidate threshold
    (which required the party to run candidates in at least 50, or 16.6%, of
    the 301 constituencies).  </p>

    noted, I agree that there are differences between the impugned thresholds
    in this case and the threshold at issue in <i>Figueroa</i>.  However, in
    my opinion, given the present state of the jurisprudence, these differences
    are insufficient to warrant a different s. 3 outcome in this case.  </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Consequently,
    the essential question to be determined is whether the [s. 435.01(1) thresholds]
    interfere[] with the capacity of individual citizens to play a meaningful

    must answer two prior questions.  First, do the members and supporters of
    political parties [that fail to meet the s.&nbsp;435.01(1) thresholds] play
    a meaningful role in the electoral process?  And if so, does the [legislative

    candidates, translates into fewer public resources being provided for smaller
    parties and comparatively more public resources for larger parties.  This
    inevitably tilts the political playing field in favour of those who meet
    the thresholds to some extent, at least.</p>

    parties are a central feature of the political life of this country. They
    provide the means by which individuals may make their voices heard in a collective
    way.  Thus, public measures that disadvantage a political party similarly
    disadvantage those citizens who choose to express their political and social
    views through the medium of that party.  This is an important characteristic
    of the Canadian polity, and is true whether parties are large or small.  As
    Iacobucci J. observed in <i>Figueroa</i>, at paras. 40-41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    capacity than any one citizen to participate in the open debate that the
    electoral process engenders.  By doing so in a representative capacity, on
    behalf of individual citizens and supporters, political parties act as a
    vehicle for the participation of individual citizens in the political life
    of the country.  Political parties ensure that the ideas and opinions of
    their members and supporters are effectively represented in the open debate
    occasioned by the electoral process and presented to the electorate as a
    viable option. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    this function. … Large or small, all political parties are capable of introducing
    unique interests and concerns into the political discourse.  Consequently,
    all political parties, whether large or small, are capable of acting as a
    vehicle for the participation of individual citizens in the public discourse
    that animates the determination of social policy.</p>

    are essential to the ability of a party and its supporters to communicate
    their message and views to the public, an area in which smaller parties are
    already disadvantaged in comparison to larger parties.  Although their impact
    may be lesser than that of the 50-candidate requirement for registration
    as a political party, the vote-based thresholds for eligibility to receive
    quarterly allowances have a similar effect: they enhance the imbalance on
    an already tilted playing field as between larger and smaller parties and
    exacerbate the differences in the respective parties’ ability to communicate
    their message.  On the <i>Figueroa</i> analysis, this, in turn, has an effect
    on the ability of their supporters to participate meaningfully in the electoral
    process.  </p>

    see no other tenable conclusion in light of the following observations by
    Iacobucci J. in <i>Figueroa</i>, at paras. 48-54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'><span lang=EN>[48]     … Section 3 prevents Parliament from <u>interfering</u> with
      the right of each citizen to play a meaningful role in the electoral process;
      it does not impose upon Parliament an obligation to enact legislation that
      enhances the capacity of political parties to raise funds for the purpose
      of communicating the ideas and opinions of its members and supporters to
      the general public. <i>However, legislation that bestows a benefit upon <u>some</u> political
      parties, but not others, requires scrutiny</i>.  In this instance, it is
      only because Parliament has extended these benefits to political parties
      that satisfy the 50-candidate threshold that its consequent failure to
      extend these benefits to political parties that do not satisfy the threshold
      constitutes an infringement of s. 3.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><a name="PNUM_49"><span lang=EN>[49]<b> </b></span></a><span lang=EN>&nbsp;The
      premise underlying this conclusion is a fairly simple one.  Owing to the
      competitive nature of the electoral process, the capacity of one citizen
      to participate in the electoral process is closely connected to the capacity
      of other citizens to participate in the electoral process.  <i>The reason
      for this is that there is only so much space for political discourse; if
      one person ‘yells’ or occupies a disproportionate amount of space in the
      marketplace for ideas, it becomes increasingly difficult for other persons
      to participate in that discourse</i>. …</span></p>

        is thus my conclusion that s. 3 imposes on Parliament an obligation not
        to enhance the capacity of one citizen to participate in the electoral
        process in a manner that compromises another citizen’s parallel right
        to meaningful participation in the electoral process.  Where legislation
        extends a benefit to some citizens, but not to others, it is necessary
        to consider carefully the impact of that legislation on the citizens
        who have not received the benefit</i>.  If the legislation interferes
        with the right of certain citizens to play a meaningful role in the social
        discourse and dialogue that the electoral process engenders, it is inconsistent
        with s. 3 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

lang=EN>&nbsp;&nbsp;Put differently, one might say that s. 3 imposes on Parliament
      an obligation not to interfere with the right of each citizen to participate

      Constitution: that of the political equality of citizens ... Elections
      are fair and equitable only if all citizens are reasonably informed of

      opportunity to present their positions ... </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    that s. 3 does not require absolute voter parity.  It is not enough to offend
    s. 3 that the legislation differentiates between one citizen and another,
    or one political party or another.  It also is necessary that the differential
    treatment have an adverse impact upon the applicant’s right to play a meaningful

      effect of the restriction on the right to issue tax receipts for donations
      received outside the election period is that parties that have satisfied
      the 50-candidate threshold are able to raise more funds than they would
      otherwise be able to raise.  Similarly, the effect of the restriction on
      the right to transfer unspent election funds to the party rather than the
      Receiver General is that only parties that have satisfied the 50-candidate
      threshold are able to retain unspent election funds.
     <i>In each instance, the effect of the threshold is that political parties
    that have satisfied the threshold requirement have more resources at their
    disposal for the purpose of communicating their ideas and opinions to the
    general public. The flip side of the coin is that it is even more difficult
    for a party that has not satisfied the 50-candidate threshold to publicize
    its own ideas and views</i>.  As the Court observed in <i>Libman, supra</i>,
    at para. 47, there already is reason to be concerned that the most affluent
    parties will dominate the public discourse and deprive their opponents of
    a reasonable opportunity to speak and to be heard.  Legislation that augments
    this disparity increases the likelihood that the already marginalized voices
    of political parties with a limited geographical base of support will be
    drowned out by mainstream parties with an increased ability to both raise
    and retain election funds.</span></p>

          in turn, diminishes the capacity of the individual members and supporters
          of such parties to play a meaningful role in the electoral process</u></i>.  As
          discussed above, political parties act as a vehicle for the participation
          of individual citizens in the electoral process; they are the primary
          mechanism by which individual citizens introduce their own ideas and
          opinions into the public dialogue that elections spawn.  Legislation
          that contributes to a disparity in the capacity of the various political
          parties to participate in that dialogue ensures that some persons have
          a more effective vehicle for their ideas and opinions than others.  The
          50-candidate threshold thus infringes s. 3 of the <i>Charter</i> by
          decreasing the capacity of the members and supporters of the disadvantaged
          parties to introduce ideas and opinions into the open dialogue and

lang=EN>&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction on these benefits has a more general adverse
      effect as well.  The right to play a meaningful role in the electoral process
      includes the right of each citizen to exercise the right to vote in a manner
      that accurately reflects his or her preferences.  In order to exercise
      the right to vote in this manner, citizens must be able to assess the relative
      strengths and weaknesses of each party’s platform – and in order to assess
      the relative strengths and weaknesses of each party, voters must have access
      to information about each candidate.  As a consequence,<i> <u>legislation
      that exacerbates a pre-existing disparity in the capacity of the various

      the effect of withholding from political parties that have not satisfied
      the 50-candidate threshold the right to issue tax receipts for donations
      received outside the election period and the right to retain unspent election
      funds.  <i><u>By derogating from the capacity of marginal or regional parties

    rather, an integrity measure.  Parliament is not saying it cannot afford
    to pay the quarterly allowances to smaller parties.  It is saying that steps
    must be taken to ensure that political party funding is preserved for legitimate
    public discourse in order to safeguard the electoral process and its public
    funding regime.  One of Parliament’s most sacrosanct roles is to preside
    over and govern resort to the public purse.  Maintaining public confidence

    the thresholds help to ensure that groups who choose to register as political
    parties, but who have little intention of engaging in true electoral competition
    or in the political discourse of the day – for example, parties interested
    only in satirizing the political process (the Rhinoceros Party), or in using

    introducing the thresholds Parliament was endeavouring to strike a delicate
    balance between, on the one hand, the right of Canadians to participate meaningfully
    in the electoral process (the s. 3 right), and, on the other hand, the need
    to safeguard against the abuse of public funding with a view to promoting
    the larger objectives of preserving the integrity of the electoral process
    and of its public financing system (the objectives of the legislation).  In
    addressing whether it has done so in a fashion that minimally impairs the
    s. 3 right, it is useful to recall the overall public financing and support
    regime that Parliament has put in place, and the objectives of that regime,
    as described earlier in these reasons (see, in particular, paras. 6-20, <i>supra</i>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the situation under consideration in <i>Figueroa</i>, the s. 435.01(1) thresholds
    do not impede the right of political parties to be registered and thereby
    to become entitled to key public funding and informational benefits, including
    (i) the protection of its name and logo, (ii) the right to an allocation
    of free broadcasting time and to an allocation of guaranteed paid broadcasting
    time at the lowest commercial rate,  (iii) the right to provide tax receipts
    to donors between election campaigns, (iv) the right to transfer surplus
    campaign funds from individual candidates to the party, and (v) the right
    to be named on the ballot.  Parties are now entitled to those benefits upon
    satisfying the relatively modest requirements for registration provided for
    in s. 366(2) of the <i>Canada Elections Act</i> (see <i>supra</i>, at para.
    33).  Meeting the s. 435.01(1) thresholds merely entitles a political party
    to <i>additional</i> public funding benefits in the form of (a) reimbursement
    of 50% of its electoral expenses following an election, and (b) the annual
    allowance of $1.75 (indexed) for every valid vote received in the most recent
    general election, paid quarterly.  The 2% and 5% thresholds must be measured
    in the context of this regime, having regard to the fact that I have already
    determined the objectives of the thresholds to be pressing and substantial
    and the connection between those objectives and the thresholds themselves
    to be rational.</p>

    except the parties [that] do meet the threshold[s] and do receive the statutory
    financial benefit that is not given to those [that] do not” (para. 23).  This
    misapprehends the nature of the legislation, however:  a party meeting the
    thresholds and receiving the quarterly allowances, receives those allowances
    not because of the thresholds but because of the legislation providing for
    the quarterly allowances.  Moreover, it is not accurate to say that the thresholds
    benefit no one.  The thresholds benefit the members of the public as a whole
    by advancing the objectives of the legislation, as outlined above.  The application
    judge rejected the Attorney General’s argument that the impugned provisions
    were justified on the basis that their overall objectives were to maintain
    public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.  He considered
    this argument to be “without merit” and concluded, instead, that the thresholds “diminish[]
    public confidence in the electoral process and encourage[] a public perception
    that the threshold[s] exist[] only to benefit the major political parties
    who alternate, from time to time, in forming the government and are in a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    as noted above, the Supreme Court of Canada has already acknowledged – in
    the context of a threshold case in one instance, at least – that preserving
    and maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process
    and its public financing regime is an important public value in Canada:  <i>Figueroa</i>,
    at para 72; <i>Harper</i>, at paras. 102-103.  Secondly, the evidentiary
    record does not support the finding that the thresholds <i>diminish</i> public
    confidence in the electoral process.  Indeed, the record, as well as reason
    and logic, suggest that the contrary is the case:  the thresholds <i>enhance</i> public
    confidence by helping to ensure that frivolous parties with no interest in
    making a genuine contribution to the political discourse of the nation do
    not have access to direct public funding.  Professor Lisa Young testified
    to this point on cross-examination: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>My opinion is
    that it may not interfere with democracy, but reduce public confidence in
    the democratic process if there are parties making a mockery of the democratic
    process … We’ve seen the Canadian public become outraged that a public official
    wanted to be reimbursed for gum.  This is less than a dollar, but it was
    the symbolic use of it … I think that point is that my concern about misuse
    is that any report that a political party is using its funds for something
    other than the intended public policy purposes throws public confidence in
    the system into question. </p>

line-height:normal'><span>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    since the thresholds are designed to ensure that direct public funding is
    linked to true electoral endeavours, it follows logically that they enhance
    public confidence in the electoral process’s financing regime.  The Supreme
    Court has repeatedly held that courts are permitted to rely on “logic, reason
    and some social science evidence in the course of the justification analysis” where
    scientific proof is lacking: see <i>Harper</i>, <i>supra </i>at paras. 77-78; <i>Sauvé

    application judge concluded, as well, that the s. 435.01(1) thresholds could
    not be saved under s. 1, in any event, because there were “more effective
    and less damaging means of achieving [the purpose of maintaining public confidence
    in the electoral process] such as required reporting and audits were [such]
    genuinely sought” (para. 28).  The possibility of implementing an audit scheme
    to control access to the quarterly allowances was advanced as the major alternative
    for consideration in the minimal impairment analysis.  The respondents submit
    the Attorney General has failed to demonstrate that such an alternative does
    not provide an equally adequate, but less infringing, mechanism for achieving
    the government’s stated objectives such that the thresholds fail the minimal
    impairment test.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    notion of an audit mechanism as an alternative to a threshold approach to
    screening for genuine political parties draws some support from the comments
    of Justice Iacobucci in <i>Figueroa</i>.  At para. 78 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…
    [T]he government has failed to demonstrate that it could not achieve the
      same results without violating s. 3 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Consider, for
      example, the auditors and other investigators that the government already
      has at its disposal.  There is no reason to think that auditors would not
      be equally capable, if not more so, of detecting and thereby preventing,
      the misuse of funds raised pursuant to the electoral financing regime.  The
      misuse of funds, after all, is precisely the sort of mischief that auditors
      are trained to uncover, and which the state can properly criminalize in
      order to preserve the integrity of the electoral financing regime.  The
      logical inference is that precisely the same result could be achieved through
      strict spending rules and the use of auditors.</p>

    do not read this passage as determining that an audit regime will in all
    cases provide a less intrusive and equally effective alternative to a threshold
    system for screening public support, however.  Justice Iacobucci cites it
    as an example only.  In any event, there are at least two important concerns,
    from a public policy perspective, that the government is entitled to balance
    when deciding amongst these options.  First, an audit regime creates serious
    potential for unwarranted interference in the internal affairs and policies
    of a political party.  Secondly, such a scheme raises concerns in relation
    to the independence of the Chief Electoral Officer who is charged with the
    impartial and non-partisan task of maintaining the integrity of the electoral
    process.</p>

    the Attorney General submits, the introduction of an audit regime would require
    Parliament to put in place a set of statutory or regulatory provisions on
    how registered political parties can and cannot spend their public funds,
    thereby potentially constraining the political activities of those parties.  Auditors
    would be required to monitor how parties spend their money to ensure they
    are used in accordance with the statutory or regulatory prescriptions.  The
    office of the Chief Electoral Officer would, in turn, have to conduct compliance
    audits to verify these uses.  In doing so, it would invariably be called
    upon to make judgment calls on how the parties are using their public funds,
    thus potentially jeopardizing the role of the Chief Electoral Officer as
    the impartial administrator of the <i>Act</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is support in the record for Parliament’s choice of this alternative.  For
    example, in commenting on a regulatory alternative to thresholds, Prof. Peter
    Aucoin testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

      aggressively against perceived or alleged misuses of the public funding
      scheme, charges of partisanship, or at least of bureaucratic arbitrariness,
      would be bound to arise and thereby diminish public confidence in the integrity
      of the public funding scheme … If, on the other hand, officials were unwilling
      to intervene,
    … then the capacity to ensure that the<i> Act</i>'s intended public policy
    purposes are being realized would be undermined.&nbsp; Both of these undesired
    outcomes are avoided by the vote-based threshold, which is clearly the better
    mechanism for limiting any restrictions on rights in defining political parties
    and their functions and for removing the need to oblige officials to exercise
    discretion </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… The …allowance
    schemes help political parties to perform their critical functions within
    the electoral and governance processes.&nbsp; However, these schemes do not
    intrude on the autonomy of political parties by defining, in the law itself…,
    the functions that are eligible to be publicly funded … </p>

    political parties play a critical role in the democratic process, they remain
    independent, private, organizations and their continued separation from the

    is fundamental.  One constitutional scholar put it this way:<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    a unique space in the governmental structure of constitutional democracies.  On
    the one hand, they perform a variety of representative, participative, integrative
    etc. functions that are absolutely essential to the operation of systems
    of government which are grounded in the principles of democracy (popular
    sovereignty) and constitutionalism (rule of law).  On the other, unlike all
    of the other major institutions that form part of the framework of government,
    political parties stand apart and quite separate from the state.  Political
    parties live in a kind of “never never” land; betwixt and between; neither

    the ideals and values on which constitutional democracies are based.  Though

    and internal affairs of political parties.  For the reasons outlined above,
    an audit regime designed to thwart the misuse of public funding by political
    parties would run the risk of impinging on their autonomy and internal affairs.  It
    would require the enactment of intrusive statutory and/or regulatory provisions

    should be taken to ensure that the impartiality of this critical public role
    is not unnecessarily compromised – actually or potentially, in the eyes of

    would effectively safeguard the misuse of public funds and thereby address
    the objectives of the <i>Act</i> to preserve the integrity of the electoral
    process and its public financing system.  It may or may not do so in a manner
    that is less intrusive than the s. 435.01(1) thresholds.  However, that would
    not be the end of the matter in any event.  Impugned legislation that violates
    the <i>Charter</i> may still meet the minimal impairment test, in my view – even
    if it is possible to conceive of an effective alternative that may be less
    intrusive – if both the impugned provision and the alternative measure form
    part of a reasonable range of policy options open to Parliament to choose

    courts or litigants to <i>create</i> alternative measures that in their view
    are preferable and less intrusive; the purpose is to determine whether the
    impugned measure “falls within a range of reasonable alternatives”: <i>RJR-MacDonald,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The impairment
    must be ‘minimal’, that is, the law must be carefully tailored so that rights
    are impaired no more than necessary.  <i>The tailoring process seldom admits
    of perfection</i> and the courts must accord some leeway to the legislator. <i>If
    the law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives, the courts will
    not find it overbroad merely because they can conceive of an alternative

    my view, therefore, Parliament was constitutionally permitted to select the
    relatively modest voting threshold approach over the option of an auditing
    regime, here, in order to achieve the objectives of the legislation.  Why?  Because
    there is a reasonable apprehension that the audit option could have a significant
    deleterious effect on other values fundamental to the electoral process – namely,
    the need to preserve the independence and internal autonomy of political
    parties and the need to preserve the actual or perceived impartiality and
    integrity of the office of the Chief Electoral Officer.</p>

    do the thresholds fail on the ground that they are overly broad, in my view.  In
    some cases the thresholds may disqualify small political parties with genuine
    political goals from receiving the quarterly payments.  They may therefore
    catch some political parties that do not fall within the scope of the mischief
    the thresholds are designed to address, <i>i.e.</i>, the misuse of public
    funds in a way that reflects adversely on the integrity of the electoral
    system and its financing regime.  However, given the level of electoral support
    for most of these parties, almost any threshold would have that impugned

    is the case here.  I have already concluded that the objectives of the thresholds
    are pressing and substantial, and that there is a rational connection between
    the thresholds and those objectives.  In spite of the foregoing concerns,
    and given Parliament’s reasoned apprehension of the harm addressed, I am

      they guard against the subversion of the electoral process by groups that
      register as political parties for commercial, satirical or other non-political
      purposes.  The integrity of the electoral process and of its electoral
      financing regime is enhanced because public money is directed towards genuine
      electoral and political endeavours.  Secondly, as the expert evidence suggests,
      public confidence in the electoral process is increased when these objectives
      are attained.  In short, the two main salutary effects of the s. 435.01(1)
      thresholds serve to strengthen a core component of

      in the capacity of smaller political parties to communicate their messages
      in competition with larger parties, as I have concluded above.  This impacts
      upon the ability of the individual respondents, and others who are also
      members of such smaller parties, to participate meaningfully in the electoral
      process.  These party respondents, moreover, have been deprived of public
      funding in the form of the quarterly allowances, despite the fact that

    considerations are identical and, although the right against which the infringement
    is weighed is different (the right to be free from discrimination, as opposed
    to the right to participate meaningfully in the electoral process), the balancing

    to his or her personal dignity (which is undoubtedly true) and that membership
    in a political party signifies an individual’s adherence to a certain system

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The first issue
    is concerned with the question of whether the law causes differential treatment.  The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    impugned law (a) draw a formal distinction between the claimant and others

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(C)  Does the
    differential treatment discriminate, by imposing a burden upon or withholding

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Each of these

    those factors into account, there are two possible comparator groups here:
    (i) smaller political parties that do not achieve the 2% or 5% thresholds
    (“non-threshold achieving parties”), and larger political parties that do
    (“threshold achieving parties”); or, (ii) individuals who are members or
    supporters of such smaller or larger parties.  Only the latter are entitled
    to claim that the thresholds infringe s. 15, however.  Thus, the identification

    allowances are paid to political parties.  They are not paid to individuals.  On
    the other hand, only individuals may claim the protection of s. 15.  Thus
    the respondent political parties are not entitled to assert a claim under
    s. 15 that they, themselves, have been subject to differential treatment
    from larger parties.  “Non-threshold achieving parties” versus “threshold
    achieving parties” is therefore not the appropriate comparator.  The comparator
    must be “individuals who are members or supporters of non-threshold achieving
    parties” versus “individuals who are members or supporters of threshold achieving
    parties”.  Where, then, does that comparator take us in the <i>Law</i> analysis?</p>

    short answer is that the respondent’s s. 15(1) claim fails on the first prong
    of the inquiry.  Assuming it can be argued that the s. 435.01(1) thresholds
    treat members or supporters of non-threshold achieving parties differently
    than those of threshold achieving parties, they do not distinguish between
    smaller and larger parties, or their members or supporters, on the basis
    of personal characteristics.  The differential treatment is based upon the
    number of votes a party obtains in a general election.  Indeed, in substance
    the impugned thresholds treat <i>the parties</i> differently.  Parties are
    not entitled to seek s. 15 relief.</p>

    might argue that there is an <i>indirect</i> differential treatment between
    the comparator groups of individuals because – as I have acknowledged in
    the s. 3 portion of these reasons – “political parties act as a vehicle for
    the participation of individual citizens in the political life of the country … [and] … ensure
    that the ideas and opinions of their members and supporters are effectively
    represented in the open debate occasioned by the electoral process”: <i>Figueroa</i>,
    para. 40.  From this, it may be said, the <i>indirect</i> differential treatment

    reject this notion, however.  The s. 435.01(1) thresholds treat <i>political
    parties</i> differently by disqualifying those who do not meet them from
    receiving the quarterly allowances.  The differential treatment is vote-based
    only, depending upon the amount of electoral support a party receives during
    an election.  It is has nothing to do with the personal beliefs or political
    affiliation of the individual members or supporters of those parties.  There
    is simply no basis in the record for concluding that the purpose or effect
    of the thresholds is to control or affect in any way a person’s political
    beliefs or affiliation or that quarterly relief funding is related to any
    such characteristics.  Anyone is free to join or support whatever political
    party he or she wishes.  Anyone is free to hold and espouse whatever political
    beliefs he or she chooses.  Whether their preferred political party does,
    or does not, receive the quarterly allowance is an entirely separate matter,
    in my view.  I conclude, then, that it is not necessary or appropriate to
    resort to s. 15 in the circumstances of this case.  To the extent that a

    begin with the same observation that I made in connection with the s. 15
    claim:  even if I were to conclude that the thresholds violated either s.
    2(b) or 2(d) – which I do not – the violations would be saved by s. 1 of

    neither respondents’ counsel nor appellant’s counsel framed their arguments
    in terms of “under-inclusiveness”, the essence of the respondents’ position
    is that the s. 435.01(1) threshold regime is under-inclusive because it deprives
    non-threshold achieving parties of the positive right to public funding in
    the form of the quarterly allowances available to threshold achieving parties.  The
    requirements for asserting <i>any</i> s. 2 claim are the same in such circumstances: <i>Dunmore

    a government defending a <i>Charter</i> challenge alleges, or the <i>Charter</i> complainant
    concedes, that a positive rights claim is being made under s. 2(b), a court
    must proceed in the following way.  First it must consider whether the activity
    for which the claimant seeks s. 2(b) protection is a form of expression.  If
    so, then second, the court must determine if the claimant claims a positive
    entitlement to government action, or simply the right to be free from government
    interference.  If it is a positive rights claim, then third, the three
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Dunmore</i> factors must be considered.  As indicated above, these three
    factors are (1) that the <i>claim is grounded in a fundamental freedom of
    expression rather than in access to a particular statutory regime</i>; (2)
    that the claimant has demonstrated that exclusion from a statutory regime
    has the effect of <i>a substantial interference</i> with s. 2(b) freedom
    of expression, or has the purpose of infringing freedom of expression under
    s. 2(b); and (3) that the government is responsible for the inability to
    exercise the fundamental freedom …  If the three factors are satisfied then
    s. 2(b) has been infringed and the analysis will shift to s. 1. [Emphasis

    435.01(1) thresholds do not lead to any substantial interference with the
    ability of members or supporters of political parties to exercise their freedom
    of expression or their freedom of association.  <i>Diminished</i> effectiveness
    in the ability to convey a message, or in the ability to associate, is not

    exclusion of the respondent political parties from the receipt of quarterly
    allowances interferes with the ability of the individual respondents, or
    of other members and supporters of non-threshold achieving parties, to express

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Today there

    .  These include, for example, electoral rights, the conduct of elections,
    the establishment of the office of the Chief Electoral Officer to oversee
    the process, election finances, the regulation and financing of political
    parties, a regime of offences relating to breaches of the <i>Act</i>, and

    would be more persuaded by the respondents’ position if the “deemed person” provision
    had been placed in the portion of the <i>Act</i> regulating the registration
    and activities of political parties.  Were that the case, it might suggest
    more strongly that Parliament intended to create a free-standing right on
    the part of political parties to sue and to be sued, thus abrogating the
    common law disability of a political party, as an unincorporated association,
    to do so.  Placing the provision in Part 19 of the <i>Act</i> – dealing with
    enforcement, offences and compliance – signals a more limited intention on
    the part of Parliament, in my opinion, and bolsters the argument that the “deemed
    person” provisions of s. 504(a) are designed to give political parties the
    status of legal entities for purposes of proceedings under the <i>Act</i> only.</p>

      in question in that case: “the 50-candidate threshold” (first square brackets); “that
      nominate fewer than 50 candidates” (second square brackets).  Where the
      third square brackets are inserted the text refers to the particular benefits
      available in that case upon registration as a political party: “the right
      to issue tax receipts for donations received outside the election period,
      to transfer unspent election funds to the party and to list their party
      affiliation on the ballot papers”.  I have substituted reference to the
