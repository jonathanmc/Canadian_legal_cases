    issue in this appeal is whether the police breached the respondent’s right
    to retain counsel of his choice under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter </i>and,
    if so, whether the ensuing breathalyser results should have been excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing the s. 10(b) issue, the trial judge recognized, correctly in our
    view, that there are no hard and fast rules that govern the analysis; rather,
    each case must be determined on its own facts and circumstances. The trial
    judge found that the arresting officer made reasonable efforts to contact
    the respondent’s counsel of choice and he found no s. 10(b) violation. Hence,
    he did not engage in a s. 24(2) analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the summary conviction appeal judge found that the trial judge erred
    in his s. 10(b) analysis and that he came to the wrong conclusion. Applying
    what he considered to be the correct legal principles, the summary conviction
    appeal judge concluded that the arresting officer did not make adequate efforts
    to contact the respondent’s counsel of choice and he accordingly breached
    the respondent’s rights under s. 10(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary conviction appeal judge then considered s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> and,
    in brief reasons, reproduced in full below, he concluded that the breathalyser
    readings should be excluded from evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Because the
    breach of the right to counsel of choice was a serious one, the evidence
    of the breathalyzer readings is inadmissible under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The denial of access to counsel of choice because of an inadequate effort
    of an arresting officer to contact the lawyer is a significant error in cases
    like this one. The seriousness of the breach is aggravated by the lack of
    resources made available to Constable Marxer by the Toronto Police Services.
    This case shows an institutionalized failure to respect the right to counsel
    of choice in cases like this one. The values embraced by the right to counsel
    of choice are an important part of the legal landscape in a case like this,
    and they were given a casual emphasis by the police. Arranging to speak with
    duty counsel, while helpful to the Crown, is not a sufficient answer under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. See <i>R. v. Kitaitchik</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C.
    (3d) 14 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Clayton</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1078 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, we are of the view that the summary conviction appeal
    judge erred in excluding the breathalyser results under s. 24(2). That being
    so, we need not finally decide whether he correctly overruled the trial judge
    on the s. 10(b) issue. These reasons should not be taken as an indication
    that he was correct in doing so. Indeed, that issue, in our view, remains
    very much an open question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming,
    for purposes of s. 24(2), that the arresting officer did not make reasonable
    efforts to contact the respondent’s counsel of choice, in our view, he missed
    the mark by very little. By no means can it be said that the breach here,
    if one occurred, was clear-cut. On the contrary, this was at best a close
    call and the summary conviction appeal court judge erred in characterizing
    the breach as “serious”. If anything, we are satisfied that the breach was
    a minor one and in the end, it occasioned no prejudice whatsoever to the
    respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the summary conviction appeal judge’s s. 24(2) analysis was brief.  It
    essentially focused on the nature and gravity of the breach and failed to
    consider other relevant factors. A more complete analysis follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    dealing with trial fairness, assuming that the breath samples constituted “conscriptive” evidence,
    they were minimally intrusive and essential to control the societal problem
    of drinking and driving. They were also entirely reliable, a fact conceded
    by the respondent at trial. Those features militate in favour of inclusion.
    See <i>R. v. Richfield</i> (2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    next to the seriousness of the breach, as indicated, we are of the view that
    the summary conviction appeal judge erred in characterizing it as serious.
    The arresting officer acted in good faith throughout. He made sincere efforts
    to locate the respondent’s counsel of choice. His efforts included:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the phone number of a friend who, according to the          respondent, would

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting,
    for purposes of s. 24(2), that the officer could and should have done more,
    such as calling directory assistance or checking the Canada 411 service through
    the internet, in the face of the efforts he did make (which the trial judge
    found to be sufficient in the circumstances) the summary conviction appeal
    judge overstated the nature of the breach when he found that it showed “an
    institutionalized failure to respect the right to counsel of choice in cases
    like this one”.  The evidence in this case fell considerably short of warranting
    a serious finding of that nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in assessing the seriousness of the breach, the summary conviction appeal
    judge failed to take into account that the breach did not prejudice the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record shows either that the respondent accepted the officer’s invitation
    to speak to duty counsel or that he initiated his own request to do so after
    the officer informed him he could not locate his counsel of choice. Regardless
    of the precise manner in which he came to speak to duty counsel, the respondent
    did speak to duty counsel for a period of twelve minutes. At no time during
    or after the call did he complain about having to speak to duty counsel;
    nor did he complain about the adequacy of the advice he received. Indeed,
    in his testimony on the <i>voir dire</i>, the respondent acknowledged that
    he “did not have any problem with what he had been told” by duty counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    the respondent spoke to duty counsel and was content with the advice he received
    is especially significant in this case. It attenuates to a large extent the
    seriousness of the breach for two reasons. First, the record is silent on
    whether there was any reasonable likelihood of contacting respondent’s counsel
    of choice at 3:00 a.m., even if the arresting officer had been able to locate
    his phone number.  Second, the inability to retain counsel of choice in these
    circumstances, while not insignificant, is far less significant than the
    inability to retain counsel of choice for trial, as was the situation in <i>R.
    v.  McCallen</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, if there was a s. 10(b) breach here, it was minor and inconsequential.
    The summary conviction appeal judge erred in concluding otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    the summary conviction appeal judge failed to properly assess whether excluding
    the breathalyser results would have a more serious impact on the repute of
    the administration of justice than admitting them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, we are satisfied that the exclusion of reliable evidence needed
    to establish the serious offence with which the respondent was charged would
    do more harm than good to the administration of justice. The breach here
    was neither flagrant nor wilful and as we have already observed, the evidence
    did not substantiate a finding of institutional indifference to individual
    rights. Accordingly, the repute of the justice system would suffer if the
    evidence were excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
