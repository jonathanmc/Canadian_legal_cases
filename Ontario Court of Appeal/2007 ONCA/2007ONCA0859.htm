  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and a co-accused were tried for the following offences: conspiracy
    to import cocaine, importing cocaine, and importing hashish.  The jury found
    the appellant guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine and importing cocaine,
    but not guilty of importing hashish.  His co-accused was acquitted on all
    counts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      importing conviction consisted of bringing some 270 kilograms of cocaine
      into
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  On the evidence of intercepted phone calls the trial judge found, at the
    time of his sentencing, that the appellant was
    “the overall boss in the conspiracy to import cocaine and continued in that
    capacity as a party to the importation itself.”  The trial judge sentenced
    the appellant to the maximum penalty, imprisonment for life. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>He
      appeals both his conviction and sentence.  The appellant submits that in
      the trial judge’s charge to the jury he committed two errors: (i) he improperly
      instructed on the standard of proof; and (ii) he failed to give a limiting
      instruction respecting evidence of other criminal activity by the appellant.</span></p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 7, 2001, a private jet landed at
    <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">
    Lake Simcoe
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Airport near
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Barrie,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Police officers who were waiting for the plane observed people
    arrive in several vehicles, approach the plane, and then walk away carrying
    bags.  The people in and around the plane were arrested, including the pilot.  The
    police seized several bags containing a total of 270 kilograms of cocaine
    and 16.4 kilograms of hashish. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was not among the people arrested, nor was he anywhere near the
    plane.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant was involved in arranging
    the importation of both the cocaine and hashish, both on this occasion and
    in the past.  The appellant and several other people were arrested on July
    9, 2002. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s case rested almost entirely on intercepted telephone com-munications.  The
    intercepts showed that the appellant and others were clearly involved in
    agreements to effect some unlawful purpose.  Included in the Crown’s theory
    was that the pilot of the plane and other persons involved on this occasion
    had been involved with the appellant in the past. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was the defence position that although the appellant was clearly involved
    in the importation of controlled substances, he was importing hashish or
    hashish oil, not cocaine.  Furthermore, the appellant’s position was that
    he was not involved in arranging the November 7 flight and had no prior knowledge
    of it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will provide other relevant facts and background when I discuss the related
    issues in this appeal.  In that regard, and for the reasons that follow,
    I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.  At the same time, I would
    grant leave to appeal the life sentence imposed, allow the appeal, and substitute
    a term of imprisonment of nineteen years.</p>
  <h2>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</h2>
  <h2><i>(i)        Jury Charge - Reasonable Doubt</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave the jury the standard <i>Lifchus</i> instruction on reasonable
    doubt.  However, he added the following explanation of  “reasonable doubt”:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is a very
    important part of our criminal system.  Reasonable doubt is not a farfetched
    or frivolous doubt.  It is not a doubt based on sympathy or prejudice.  It
    is a doubt based on reason and common sense.  <i>The old pit of the stomach
    test.  You have got to feel it.  That is what common sense is all about</i>.  Common
    sense is something that you have collectively gained, again, over the passage
    of years.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that by telling the jury that a reasonable doubt is something
    they have to “feel” in the “pit of the stomach” and by equating common sense
    with such a feeling, the trial judge engaged in misdirection.  He contends
    that by instructing the jury that “a feeling” is “what common sense is all
    about”, the trial judge effectively invited the jury to decide the case based
    on intuition instead of a reasoned and logical analysis of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    in his charge, the trial judge gave the following instruction:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So, when you go to your jury room, use the same
    old common sense we have talked about, that you use everyday in getting yourself
    up in the morning. Why do you get up [in] the morning [at] 6 o’clock? Answer,
    I have to go to work. Or I have to go to Tim Horton’s, or I have to do something.
    There is a reason for everything. Common sense tells you how you move from
    stage one to stage two in your reasoning process. There is no magic formula
    in deciding how much or how little to believe of a witness’s testimony or
    how much to rely upon it in deciding the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that this instruction is contrary to directions from the
    Supreme Court of Canada in that the deliberation process should not be likened
    to the approach one takes to everyday decisions.  See <i>R. v. Bisson</i> (1998),
    121 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 454 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are several factors, as I will demonstrate, that support upholding the trial
    judge’s charge in this case.  And, after considering those factors, I am
    satisfied that the trial judge’s description of the meaning of “reasonable
    doubt” — although regrettable in part —
    nevertheless, meets the standard required by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Lifchus</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and <i>R.
    v.</i> <i>Starr </i>(2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).  I am convinced
    that the jury in this case was not confused as to the proper standard of
    proof to apply in its deliberations.</p>
  <h2><i>The Law on Reasonable Doubt </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question in this case — as it is in all cases where a trial judge’s instructions
    on reasonable doubt are impugned — is whether there is a reasonable likelihood
    that the jury was under a misapprehension as to the correct standard of proof
    to apply:<i> Starr</i>, <i>supra </i>at para. 233; <i>R. v. Archer</i> (2005),
    202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 at para. 37(Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In answering this question the charge must be assessed by reading it
    in its entirety, and not by focusing on particular words that might have
    been omitted or included: <i>R. v. Bertucci</i> (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 453
    at para. 9 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )<span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the Supreme Court in <i>Lifchus</i> has set out specific language that it
    recommends be used for the purpose of defining
    “reasonable doubt”, this language is not mandatory.  And as that court stated
    in <i>R. v. Russell</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 66 at para. 23 (S.C.C.),
    an appellate court should only interfere if there is a
    “serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict [leading] to the
    conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    have been numerous cases that have examined reasonable doubt jury charges
    in the wake of <i>Lifchus</i> and <i>Starr</i>.  The cases have consistently
    stressed the need for flexibility and shown hesitancy towards reversing a
    trial result based on the presence of a few misspoken words.  At the same
    time, however, this court has repeatedly stated that the boundaries set out
    by the Supreme Court must be guarded.  It is this balance that I have kept
    in mind when analyzing the charge that is the subject of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Zebedee </i>(2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 199 at para. 41, this court upheld
      a charge where a judge told jurors that they need proof that “convinces
      your mind and satisfies your conscience.”  Although this type of “morality-laden
      language” should be avoided, it is not automatically fatal to the charge.  In <i>R.
      v. Pan; R. v. Sawyer</i> (2001), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 127, the Supreme
      Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    allowed a jury charge where the judge told the jury: “You must be able to
    say to yourself, ‘He is really guilty.  Of that I am morally certain.’” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
    charges have been upheld in which judges have told juries that, reasonable
    doubt has an “ordinary natural meaning” and no “special connotation”: <i><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. Feeley</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 449 </span>(Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and which contained “timid juror” references:
    See <i>Zebedee, supra </i>a<span lang=EN-US>t para. 53</span>.  </p>
  <h2><i>Application to this Case</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I alluded to earlier, there are a number of factors that are important when
    considering jury charges that on their face fall short of the standard, such
    as is contended in this case.  Some of these factors are particularly relevant
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first factor is whether the rest of the charge was exemplary: <i><span lang=EN-US>Feeley</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, <i>supra</i></span>.  When
    a charge closely tracks the model charge from <i>Lifchus</i> with only slight
    deviations, it is unlikely that the jury has been misled as to the standard
    to be applied: <i><span lang=EN-US>Archer</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, <i>supra </i></span>at
    para. 38.  In <i>R. v. Pilgrim </i>(2001), 150 O.A.C. 394 a<span lang=EN-US>t
    para. 4</span>, the jury charge took six hours to deliver and had raised
    only one objection by defence.  In dismissing the appeal, Justice Borins
    wrote that “with the exception of the impugned aspect of the charge, it represents
    a model charge.”  In my view, this is such a case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second factor is whether the judge correctly explains the concept elsewhere.  In <i>D.W.
    v. The Queen </i>(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 a<span
lang=EN-US>t 409-10</span> the Supreme Court of Canada in discussing the burden
    of proof observed that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where an error is made in the instruction on the
    burden of proof, the fact that the trial judge correctly instructed on that
    issue elsewhere in the charge is a strong indication that the jury were not
    left in doubt as to the burden resting on the Crown.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the trial judge gave the complete <i>Lifchus</i> charge not once but twice.
    He briefly explained to the jury the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt at the commencement of the trial.  On October 12<sup>,</sup> he instructed
    the jury on reasonable doubt in a fashion wholly consistent with <i>Lifchus</i>.  On
    October 14, the trial judge once again instructed the jury on reasonable
    doubt, which was also consistent with <i>Lifchus</i> except for the impugned
    sentences.  Leaving aside the sentences in question, the concept was fully
    and properly explained to the jury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third factor is whether the instructions on reasonable doubt are preceded
    by full and complete instructions on the presumption of innocence and the
    burden of proof: <i>Zebedee</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 41.  If reasonable
    doubt is strongly linked with the presumption of innocence, it is less likely
    that the jury will have been misled by the direction: <i>Feeley</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    para. 13. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    impugned sentences in this charge obviously refer to the trial judge’s attempt
    to define common sense in an unsophisticated and simple fashion.  If his
    instructions had ended with this comment, it would have been a more troubling
    charge.  However, the trial judge not only qualifies his definition correctly
    with the sentence that immediately follows, but defines it even further,
    wholly in accordance with the requirements of <i>Lifchus</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge instructed that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    is linked to the presumption of innocence.&nbsp; Thus, the charge linked
    the two concepts adequately.  He instructed the jury repeatedly that the
    presumption of innocence remained unless and until the Crown had proved every
    element of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the accused had
    no obligation to prove anything.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Additionally,
    in further compliance with <i>Lifchus</i>, the jury was instructed to decide
    the case without sympathy, prejudice or fear.  On at least two occasions
    the jury was instructed that reasonable doubt is based upon reason and common
    sense, although on the second occasion the trial judge unnecessarily included
    the impugned sentences.  The jury was instructed that the standard of proof <span lang=EN>“logically
    arises from the evidence or the lack of evidence.”</span>  And, the jury
    was instructed that more is required than that the accused is probably or
    likely guilty.  He added that, “proof of probable or likely guilt is not
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    fourth — and very important — factor identified by this court is whether
    a jury convicts an accused on some counts while acquitting on others.  Doing
    so strongly suggests that the jury appreciated the requisite standard of
    proof for a conviction: <i>R. v. J.P.S.</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 1890 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 23; <i>R. v. Bolus,</i> [2002] O.J. No. 386 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the jury found the appellant guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine and importing
    cocaine, but not guilty of importing hashish.  And as I noted at the outset,
    they found the co-accused who was tried with him not guilty on all counts.  Considering
    the complexity of the evidence in this case, these verdicts strongly suggest
    that the jury was applying a high standard of proof and not relying only
    on emotion, feeling or intuition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, when the jury charge in this case is considered in its entirety,
    and not by focusing on the particular words that were included, the appeal
    must be dismissed.  That is to say, in answer to the question that is central
    in cases such as this, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury was
    under a misapprehension as to the correct standard of proof to apply. </p>
  <h2><i>The “Tim Horton’s” Charge</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    set out above, the trial judge also referred to the process of making everyday
    decisions in part of his jury charge.  The appellant argues that the trial
    judge invited the jury to take the same approach to a finding of guilt as
    they would to making everyday decisions.  This type of instruction has been
    said to be inappropriate by the Supreme Court.  The respondent argues that
    the judge, in this passage, was describing only the reasoning process to
    be applied to making individual findings of fact along the way.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the respondent is correct.  When the trial judge gave this part
    of the charge, the trial judge had moved on from explaining the basic principles
    on to the evaluation of the evidence.  In the impugned passage, the judge
    says that “common sense tells you how you move from stage one to stage two
    in your reasoning process.”  This comment is prefaced, however, by his instructions
    to rely (or not rely) on the testimony of witnesses, the audio recordings,
    and the presentation of counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, I am satisfied that when the jury instructions are read as a whole,
    the jury would not have misunderstood the correct standard of proof required
    to convict the appellant.  This argument, respectfully, does not alter my
    opinion on the charge respecting reasonable doubt that was given in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    leaving this area of appeal, I wish to make a brief comment about this charge
    on reasonable doubt.  This court has said on numerous occasions that language
    such as that used by the trial judge in this case ought to be avoided.  After <i>Lifchus</i> and <i>Starr</i> it
    was expected that this ground of appeal would virtually disappear.  Regrettably,
    that does not appear to be the case.  Nevertheless, I do not view this unfortunate
    and unnecessary language as being fatal in this case.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
    consideration of the factors set out above, it is my view that they support
    the conclusion that this jury charge did not mislead the jury as to the proper
    standard of proof to be applied.  In my view, when read as a whole, the instructions
    on reasonable doubt were adequate and met that test.  I would reject this
    ground of appeal.</p>

    trial, through his trial counsel, the appellant acknowledged that he was
    involved in the drug trade, although not cocaine.  In light of this, counsel
    requested that the jury be given a limiting instruction.  That is, he wanted
    the trial judge to warn the jury that it was not to infer that the appellant
    was the type of person who was likely involved in the cocaine trade.  He
    now says that the trial judge erred because he neither responded to this
    request, nor gave the limiting instruction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      my view, and as with the previous ground of appeal, when the jury instructions
      are read as a whole, the trial judge adequately dealt with the evidence
      of other criminal activity by the appellant.  I reach this conclusion for
      two reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First,
      t</span>he trial judge instructed the jury that their concern was the alleged
      cocaine conspiracy, and not other possible conspiracies.  The judge clearly
      explained that the appellant’s general involvement in the drug trade was
      to have no effect on their decision about the cocaine conspiracy.  However,
      while the appellant acknowledges this aspect of the jury charge was given
      several times, he argues that it falls short of what is mandatory.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that there are two mandatory components to a limiting instruction
    regarding evidence of prior discreditable conduct.  He argues that the jury
    must be instructed that they are not to use the evidence in two ways: (i)
    to punish the accused person other than for the offences charged; and (ii)
    to reason that the accused person is, by virtue of his involvement in other
    discreditable conduct, the type of person to commit the offences charged
    and is therefore more likely to be guilty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    most telling portion of the trial judge’s charge to the jury, and which I
    believe addresses the grievance of the appellant, is as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Again, there was a concession, and counsel did not
    suggest that these people were up to something that was legal.  In fact,
    quite the opposite, that they may well have been up to something illegal.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Further, it is most likely that Malanca and Blewitt
    were involved in the drug trade.  However, they are not charged with being
    involved in the drug trade.  You are not here to punish them for things they
    did quite outside anything that is alleged against them here.  So, because
    they may have trafficked with Magic or taken his pails or done something,
    it has nothing to do with what is going on here and you are not to punish
    them by convicting them of these charges because they appear to have made
    some admission about something that had gone [on] historically in the past.  That
    is a given.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>They can only be convicted after the Crown has proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt that they conspired to import, and in fact, imported
    the specific drugs named in the three counts.  That is important.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    instructions, especially in the context of the charge read as a whole and
    with what I say below, provides ample warning to the jury as to the limited
    use that could be made of any character or propensity evidence: <i>R. v.
    Ruddick</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 421 (Ont. C.A.).  In sum, it was clear
    in the jury instructions that the appellant was not to be found guilty for
    being a bad person.  A precise statement to this effect was unnecessary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there was no risk that the jury was confused about the possible uses of general
    propensity evidence.  The appellant asserted at trial<i> </i>that the conversations
    were about unrelated discreditable conduct.  It was the appellant who tactically
    chose to put his own general character in issue.  The appellant’s theory
    itself would, therefore, impress upon the jury the limited use that could
    be made of any evidence found to be associated with other drug activity.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span

    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Farrah</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 347
    does not assist the appellant.  In <i>Farrah</i>, unlike here, there was
    no instruction whatsoever as to how the jury should deal with the accused
    person's admission that he was a drug dealer. </p>

  <h2>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      principles of sentencing relied upon by the trial judge in this case are
      captured in the following passage from his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
lang=EN-GB>The cases tell us that the paramount considerations in sentencing
      are deterrence and denunciation.  The two over-riding considerations are
      the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender
      in making sure that the sentence he receives is proportionate to these
      two considerations.  Deterrence must always reflect the moral culpability
      of the offender, as well as the seriousness of the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      trial judge considered mitigating factors that could be applied to diminish
      the appellant’s sentence.  He noted that the appellant was twenty-six or
      twenty-seven years old when he was convicted of the offences and he was
      a first time offender who has the support of his family and friends.  He
      observed that while the appellant’s background consisted of some traumatic
      experiences, they could not be described as unusual.  He noted that the
      appellant has two legitimate businesses: one concerns mortgages and financing,
      and the other is a restaurant.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As
      to any aggravating factors, the trial judge concluded that the appellant
      was the “boss” who “occupies the very pinnacle at the top of the pyramid” in
      this criminal conspiracy.  He found that the appellant had no regard for
      those below him in the drug business, nor any for the ultimate victims
      of drug use.  He concluded that the appellant was motivated solely by greed.  “[T]he
      most aggravating factor of all,” he noted, “was the immense quantity of
      cocaine imported and the unbelievable effects that that would have been
      visited on the public in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

      addition to considering the principles of deterrence and denunciation,
      the trial judge also noted that he must consider sentencing principles
      of parity and totality.  In this regard he alluded to another co-accused
      who received an effective sentence of nineteen years imprisonment “as a
      result of a guilty plea at a very early opportunity after being detained
      without bail.”  It was a joint submission. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In
      sentencing the appellant to life imprisonment, I am of the view that the
      trial judge erred in two ways.  First, he misapplied the principle of parity,
      and second, he arrived at a sentence that is manifestly unfit in all the
      circumstances. </span></p>

      consideration the principle that:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-GB>A sentence should be similar to
      sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in
      similar circum-stances.</span></p>

      co-accused’s plea and sentence of nineteen years included the same November
      7, 2001 importation as well as other offences including a completely separate
      importation conspiracy and other drug offences.  Moreover, unlike the appellant,
      that co-accused was neither a youthful offender nor a first time offender.  These
      differences, in my view, were very relevant to the principle of parity
      and were not given sufficient consideration by the trial judge. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    should have been imposed on the appellant, a youthful first offender.  The

    severe sentence.  Respectfully, in all the circumstances, I must disagree.   </span></p>

      trial judge emphasized two features as aggravating to such an extent that
      it warranted life in prison.  First, he found “the most aggravating factor” to
      be the amount of cocaine imported and its negative impact on members of
      society.  Second, he found that the appellant was the “big guy, the boss,
      the leader, orchestrator, planner and financier” of the conspiracy to import
      cocaine. </span></p>

      is important to note that the reported decision relied on by the sentencing
      judge in <i>Fievet</i> was in French, which the trial judge was unable
      to read, and thus he relied on the headnote, which was in English.  In
      this regard, the headnote reports that <i>Fievet</i> had no previous criminal
      record, yet nowhere in the trial judge’s reasons does he state this fact.  Thus,
      it is entirely unclear as to what, if any, consideration the sentencing

    of rehabilitation as a general principle.  </span></p>

      differences, <i>Fievet</i> is of little assistance to this court.  Thereafter,
      there is no

      involving the importation of large quantities of cocaine into Canada where
      it was considered to be at the higher levels of the importation hierarchy,
      reveal a high end range of sentence at about twenty years imprisonment.  Furthermore,
      these cases also involved much larger quantities of cocaine — in the thousands
      of kilograms — or offenders with prior criminal records.  Again, that is
      different from this case. </span></p>

      little to no regard was given to these important principles by the trial

      and left little room for the appellant’s rehabilitation. </span></p>

      it is not at all clear that the evidence supports the conclusion that the
      appellant was the “boss’ in this conspiracy, especially as between him
      and the co-accused who pled guilty and received nineteen years imprisonment.  In
      fact, the synopsis read in at the co-accused’s sentencing hearing — upon
      which the Crown presumably relied —
    described the co-accused as having “orchestrated” the November 7 importation. </span></p>
