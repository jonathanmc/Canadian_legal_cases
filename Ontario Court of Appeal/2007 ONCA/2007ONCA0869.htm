    primary ground of appeal arises from the appellant’s unsuccessful motion
    to have the fraud charges against him stayed on the basis of a violation
    of his right to trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  After
    the dismissal of his motion, and the trial that followed, the appellant was
    convicted of one count of theft over $1,000.  A second count of fraud was
    stayed.  The appellant’s secondary ground of appeal is that his conviction
    was based upon findings made by the trial judge that were unsupported by
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fraud for which the appellant was convicted was an historical one.  The appellant,
    a lawyer, had power of attorney over a Ms. Bourne’s financial affairs.  He
    was also the executor and sole beneficiary under her will.  Ms. Bourne purchased
    several annuities from Sun Life, from which she received monthly payments
    deposited automatically to her bank account.  Ms. Bourne died in December
    1990.  Unaware of her death, Sun Life continued to deposit the payments into
    Ms. Bourne’s bank account, which was controlled by the appellant.  In December
    1994, Sun Life learned of Ms. Bourne’s 1990 death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown alleged that the appellant deliberately failed to notify Sun Life of
    Ms. Bourne’s death in order to collect money to which, to his knowledge,
    he was not entitled.  The defence position was that the appellant had notified
    Sun Life of Ms. Bourne’s death and that he believed the annuities continued
    to be payable for five years after death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged in 1998.  However, because he was hospitalized for
    depression, he was not arrested until February 1999.  Initial Crown disclosure
    was provided in July 1999.  The appellant requested further disclosure, first
    in December 1999 and again in March 2000.  By letter dated March 8, 2000,
    the Crown refused that further disclosure.  Successive judicial pre-trials
    and set date appearances were adjourned.  The preliminary inquiry began October
    5, 2001 and concluded in March 2003, when the appellant consented to committal.  The
    appellant takes no issue on this appeal with the delay in the Superior Court;
    however, for completeness we note that further delays resulted involving
    legal aid and the retention of new counsel.  The s. 11(b) application was
    heard and dismissed in February 2004 and the trial commenced and concluded
    in the fall of 2004.  After the conclusion of trial, the defence brought
    an unsuccessful application to re-open the trial and to seek a stay of proceedings
    for abuse of process.  Following the failure of this application, the appellant
    was sentenced on November 4, 2005 to a conditional sentence of two years
    less a day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Hamilton J. heard the stay application on February 2, 2004, nearly five years
    had passed since the appellant’s arrest.  The application judge, who correctly
    recognized that this was a significant delay that merited scrutiny, dismissed
    the application after considering the reasons for the delay, including issues
    surrounding disclosure, the series of pre-trial adjournments, the circumstances
    of the preliminary inquiry and the changes in defence counsel, and after
    finding no more than minimal prejudice to the appellant inferred from the
    delay.  In arriving at this result, the application judge concluded that
    seven months of the delay (waiting for preliminary inquiry dates) was institutional
    delay.  He found the balance of the delay was either inherent delay or delay
    attributable to the defence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    finding of seven months institutional delay is not challenged.  On appeal,
    the appellant challenges the application judge’s findings in three areas:
    first, the delay surrounding the requested further disclosure and the serial
    unproductive adjournments; second, the delay during the preliminary inquiry;
    and third, the prejudice suffered by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant argues that the application judge erred in failing to attribute
    delay to the Crown from the December 22, 1999 hearing to set a date through
    to the November 8, 2000 pre-trial, which was adjourned due to the untimely
    death of defence counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, the appearances were unproductive in the challenged period
    in part because Crown counsel either did not have the Crown brief or did
    not have a sufficient grasp of the case to engage in disclosure discussions.  The
    appellant argues that this delay should be attributed to the Crown because
    it failed to assign the case (which was then described as complex) to a specific
    Crown counsel, or at least to have a properly instructed counsel attend the
    pre-trials.  In our view, while the Crown was under no obligation to assign
    a specific Crown counsel, it was obliged to have counsel attend at the pre-trials
    who had the necessary familiarity with the case.  As the Crown fairly concedes,
    it failed to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However
    this failure was not the root cause of the adjournments.  Rather, the adjournments
    arose from the defence desire to discuss the Crown’s disclosure refusal regarding
    the various third party records.  There are two points to be made.  First,
    the defence never told the attending Crowns in the challenged period that
    the disclosure issue had already been addressed by the March 8 letter.  Second,
    the requested third party records were in the possession of such institutions
    as the Law Society of Upper Canada, the Ontario Legal Aid Plan, Revenue
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the Public Trustee.  While the appellant relies on <i>R. v. Arsenault</i> (1994),
    93 C.C.C. (3d) 111 (N.B.C.A.) at p. 117 for the principle that Crown counsel
    has a duty to make reasonable inquiries of other Crown agencies that could
    be in possession of evidence, in that case the Crown agency at issue had
    been involved in the investigation that led to the criminal charges and was
    in attendance at virtually all court proceedings.  That is different from
    this case.  Here, there was no suggestion that the third parties were involved
    in any way in the investigation that led to the charges against the appellant
    and therefore no evidence that their files were subject to Crown disclosure
    obligations.  We also note that it appears the defence was already aware
    from the civil proceedings that some of the requested files were no longer
    available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, as we have said, the Crown refused disclosure of these records
    as early as March 8, 2000 on the basis that they were not in the Crown’s
    possession.  Although it was not unreasonable of the defence to suggest discussion
    about the issue at a judicial pre-trial (rather than incur the delay and
    expense of litigating the matter in a Superior Court disclosure motion),
    the defence cannot now attribute the resulting delay to the Crown in light
    of its clear position on the issue and, particularly so where the defence
    could not realistically expect the Crown to secure the requested materials
    from the third parties in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the root cause of the delay in the challenged period had already been addressed
    by the Crown in its March 8, 2000 letter, we would attribute only three months
    to Crown delay, comprised of two months from January 18 to March 15, 2000,
    for late disclosure, and one further month because the Crown appeared without
    its brief.  No delay should be attributed to the Crown from April 17 because
    the subsequent delay resulted from the defence continuing to press for disclosure
    that had already properly been refused by the Crown.  We also note that the
    request for disclosure was subsequently abandoned by the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second delay challenged on this appeal occurred during the preliminary inquiry
    from January 23, 2002 until September 19, 2002.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry, which the Crown estimated would take three days, was
    scheduled for October 2, 5 and 9, 2001.  The judge was unavailable on the
    first day.  On October 5, the preliminary inquiry began, but was interrupted
    for an unrelated matter.  Defence counsel advised the court that he would
    not be available on October 9 and, anticipating that the inquiry would not “be
    very long”, waived any s. 11(b) delay until the inquiry was concluded.  Although
    the inquiry resumed on January 23, 2002, it was adjourned first to May and
    then to September 2002 and then further adjourned. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the hearing of the s. 11(b) stay motion before the application judge, the
    Crown agreed with the defence that only the three-and-a-half months from
    October 2001 to January 2002 should be attributed to the defence.  Notwithstanding
    this agreement, the application judge found that the entire subsequent delay
    of the preliminary inquiry was attributable to the defence by reason of its
    waiver.  We do not agree.  In our view, the Crown’s concession on this point
    was reasonable in the context of the expectations of all the participants
    that the preliminary inquiry would be concluded within the next short number
    of months.  At a minimum, the application judge was not entitled to reject
    this concession on the Crown’s part, at least without explicitly addressing
    the matter in his reasons and explaining why he did so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    even accepting that the delay during the preliminary inquiry flowing from
    the defence waiver should be limited to three-and-a-half months, we do not
    accept the appellant’s submission that the balance of the disputed delay
    from January to September should be attributed to the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    come to this conclusion because explanations were provided for the intervening
    delays.  The preliminary inquiry continued on January 23 with evidence.  However,
    defence counsel asked to leave early for reasons relating to a medical appointment,
    which was accepted by the judge who also had a medical appointment.  When
    the inquiry resumed on May 14, after an initial interruption for an in-custody
    trial, defence counsel asked that the matter be adjourned because he found
    the courtroom to be “awfully hot”.  In addition, counsel alluded to ongoing
    off-the-record discussions that they wished to continue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 19, the Crown called evidence after which the parties discussed
    the possibility of re-electing and converting the preliminary inquiry into
    a trial.  The appellant does not argue that the subsequent delays of the
    preliminary inquiry are attributable to the Crown.  Further, we note that
    in the end the preliminary inquiry did not take significantly longer than
    the equivalent of the three full days originally estimated.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of these events, we agree with the application judge that the period
    of delay between January and September 2002 is not attributable to the Crown
    or to institutional delay.  Rather much of the delay was either responsive
    to the requests of the defence or was attributable to inherent scheduling
    issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we conclude only the three months of delay is attributable to the Crown.  Added
    to the seven months of institutional delay that is not challenged on this
    appeal, the total delay for the purposes of the s. 11(b) application is ten
    months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
    on this issue, the appellant argues that the application judge erred in finding
    only minimal, if any, prejudice to the appellant as a result of the delays.  On
    the application, the appellant relied on a brief affidavit from his physician
    that showed the appellant was suffering from major depression and post-traumatic
    stress disorder, which was exacerbated by the delay.  However, on appeal,
    the appellant points to more extensive medical evidence, including evidence
    that the appellant was heavily medicated for these conditions throughout
    the proceedings.  He also argues that the appellant had not practised law
    since 1994, he was under administrative suspension by the Law Society, discipline
    proceedings were outstanding, his marriage had ended, he was living in a
    shelter and that further prejudice could be inferred from the length of the
    delay, all of which prejudice was enhanced by the appellant’s vulnerability.  In
    our view, the subsequent evidence from the trial and sentencing is not admissible
    on this issue.  That evidence was available through the exercise of reasonable
    diligence and, in any event, could not have been expected to change the result.  It
    merely elaborated on evidence that was already before the application judge
    in the physician’s affidavit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we tend to think that the application judge underestimated the impact of
    the delay on the appellant’s health, the fact remains that much of the appellant’s
    mental health and other problems pre-dated the charges.  By the time of his
    arrest, his marriage had broken down, he had experienced deaths in his family
    and he was hospitalized for depression.  While there is no question that
    the delay in bringing the charges to a hearing in this case exacerbated the
    difficulty, we are satisfied that any prejudice suffered is balanced by the
    societal interest in the prosecution of the offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the combined ten months of institutional and Crown delay falls
    within the ten months recognized as acceptable in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, (1992),
    71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  Moreover, as the defence argued at the time,
    this case was perceived to be an historical and complex fraud.  Thus, even
    if an additional month of delay was attributed to the Crown, a case such
    as this necessitates longer inherent time requirements.  See <i>Morin</i> at
    p. 16.  Even considering the prejudice suffered by the appellant, the interest
    in bringing the charges to trial outweighs any interest in obtaining a stay
    of proceedings on account of delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn to the appellant’s final issue of the conviction appeal, which is based
    on the ground that the trial judge’s conclusions are unsupported by the evidence.  We
    did not find it necessary to call upon the Crown to respond to this ground
    of appeal.  In our view, the two misapprehensions of evidence that are conceded
    by the Crown were inconsequential.  First, the evidence regarding Sun Life’s
    communication of the terms of the annuities, including that the annuities
    did not provide for death benefits, was contained in a letter that Sun Life
    testified through its agent was sent to the appellant.  The trial judge’s
    additional reference to a telephone call to the same effect was in error;
    however, it was a harmless error in light of the evidence regarding the written
    correspondence.  The crucial conclusion of the trial judge that the appellant
    knew the deposits from Sun Life were made in error, or that he was reckless
    about that fact, flowed from the court’s other findings, including that the “Balder” opinion
    letter was “error-laden” and that the appellant knew about the ongoing Sun
    Life deposits.</p>

    the appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s mistaken inference that,
    because the appellant had information about the annuities sufficient to request
    an opinion about them from another lawyer, he must have received that information
    from Sun Life.  The respondent fairly concedes that it is also possible that
    the appellant had this information, not from Sun Life, but from his management
    of Ms. Bourne’s affairs and his possession of her financial documents.  The
    alleged error is immaterial, however, because the relevant fact was not how
    the information came to the appellant’s attention, but rather that he was
    in possession of it through the annuity contracts and that he would have
    been aware of their contents.    </p>

    in our view, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the appellant had the necessary subjective <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i>,
    including the appellant’s withdrawal of over $100,000 from Ms. Bourne’s account
    between the date of her death and the date the account was frozen, his extensive
    knowledge of Ms. Bourne’s financial affairs, his activities in conducting
    Ms. Bourne’s banking transactions during her life and after her death, his
    inquiries to Sun Life about the particulars of the annuities in 1994, and
    the circumstances surrounding the Balder letter of opinion.  </p>
