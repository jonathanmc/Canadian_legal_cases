style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was charged with second degree murder.  He entered a plea to the
    charge of manslaughter, but that plea was not accepted by the Crown and the
    trial proceeded.  The appellant testified and advanced essentially two defences.  First,
    he argued that the Crown had not proved the requisite <i>mens rea</i> and,
    second, he advanced the statutory partial defence of provocation.  The jury
    convicted and the trial judge imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  He
    also imposed a fourteen year parole ineligibility period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant has very ably advanced several grounds of appeal, all of
    which relate to the charge to the jury.  Counsel has also made submissions
    with respect to the fitness of the parole ineligibility period. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would not give effect to any of those arguments.</p>
  <h4>The Conviction Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the instruction on intoxication as it relates to the <i>mens
    rea</i> required for murder was inadequate.  There is no doubt that intoxication
    was at play in this case.  On the evidence the appellant had consumed a considerable
    amount of crack cocaine throughout the day of the homicide and had also been
    drinking heavily.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first submission relates to the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury
    separately on the issue of whether the appellant had the capacity to form
    the requisite intent.  The trial judge could have given a separate instruction
    on the question of whether the appellant had the capacity to form the intent
    required under s. 229.  Instead, he instructed the jury exclusively in terms
    of whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    in fact had the requisite intent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was not asked by counsel at trial to instruct the jury in terms
    of capacity.  This is of some added significance because the trial judge
    conducted an elaborate pre-trial conference in which all matters, including
    this matter, were discussed in some detail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    a capacity instruction could have been given, we are satisfied that the jury
    understood the crucial question insofar as this issue was concerned, that
    is whether the Crown had proved the requisite intent.  We are also satisfied
    that the jury could not have helped but understand that the defence position
    was that by virtue of the intoxication, the appellant did not have the necessary
    intent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second submission relating to the instruction on intoxication concerns the
    foreseeability component of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement in s. 229.  Counsel
    submits the trial judge did not relate the evidence of intoxication to that
    issue.  The trial judge gave a careful “rolled up”
    instruction in his charge.  In our view, that instruction clearly and fully
    related all of the evidence, including the evidence of intoxication, to the
    question of foreseeability arising out of the <i>mens rea</i> component of
    s. 229.  The charge was adequate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal relates to the trial judge’s instruction to the jury
    that certain after-the-fact conduct was relevant to their consideration of
    whether the appellant had the requisite intent for murder.  The trial judge
    told the jury that various acts performed by the appellant immediately after
    the homicide and moving forward to several hours after the homicide were
    potentially relevant in assessing the appellant’s level of intoxication at
    the time of the homicide.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant concedes that some of the after-the-fact conduct was relevant
    to the <i>mens rea</i> issue and was properly left to the jury.  Counsel
    goes on to argue, however, that some of the conduct was so far removed in
    time from the homicide that it could not logically be of any assistance to
    the jury on the question of whether the appellant had the requisite intent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the after-the-fact conduct in some detail and made it
    clear to the jury that the evidence “may or may not”
    help them on the question of intent.  In our view, the jury would clearly
    understand that as the conduct became more removed in time from the homicide,
    it would be of less assistance to them in determining the appellant’s state
    of mind at the time of the homicide.  There was no need for the trial judge
    to go further and actually remove some of this evidence from the consideration
    of the jury.  The jury would apply their common sense to the evidence and
    understand the significance of the passage of time to the relevance of the
    evidence on the issue of whether the appellant had the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third issue arises out of the provocation instruction.  The trial judge did
    not mention the after-the-fact conduct in the course of the provocation instruction.  Counsel
    for the appellant argues that the trial judge should have specifically told
    the jury that the evidence of the after-the-fact conduct had no relevance
    to the provocation issues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct was irrelevant to the provocation
    defence, we are satisfied that the trial judge effectively told the jury
    that they could not consider this evidence when addressing the provocation
    defence.  On at least two occasions when instructing the jury on the issue
    of intent, the trial judge told the jury that the appellant’s after-the-fact
    conduct was relevant only to the issue of intent.  In our view, this amounts
    to an instruction that the evidence was irrelevant on all other issues, including
    provocation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fourth ground of appeal alleges that the trial judge implicitly withdrew
    from the jury its right to disagree and return no verdict.  We do not read
    the instruction in that way.  Near the end of the instruction, the trial
    judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>As I have already
    said to you, the verdict which you return must be a unanimous verdict.  All
    of you must agree upon that verdict that you see fit to return.  That of
    course does not mean that you do not have the right to disagree.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>As I have
      also said to you,</u> although the verdict which you return must be unanimous,
      you may take different routes to arrive at that unanimous verdict.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you reach
    a verdict …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the jury would understand from this instruction that they were
    not required to return a verdict and could disagree as to the verdict.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    conviction appeal fails.</p>
  <h4>The Sentence Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the parole ineligibility period, counsel does not contend that
    the trial judge made any error in principle.  The trial judge’s reasons for
    sentence are carefully crafted and, in our view, reflect a full appreciation
    and analysis of the relevant considerations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    does argue with some force that the period of parole ineligibility, fourteen
    years, is simply too long and beyond what could be considered a reasonable
    sentence in the circumstances of this case.  No doubt, different judges may
    have imposed a somewhat lower period of parole ineligibility.  There is some
    reason to be sympathetic towards this appellant and some reason to hope that
    at some point he may become a productive member in the community.  However,
    we cannot say that the period of parole ineligibility imposed is clearly
    unreasonable.  Consequently, we cannot interfere.  The appeal from the period
    of parole ineligibility is dismissed.  </p>
