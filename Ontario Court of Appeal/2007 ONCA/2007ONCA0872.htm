      appellant was charged with six counts of sexual assault, six counts of
      sexual interference and one count of possession of child pornography occurring
      between 2001 and 2003. At trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to the child
      pornography charge (count 13) and not guilty to the remaining charges.
      Following a trial before Molloy J., sitting without a jury, findings of
      guilt were made in relation to two counts of sexual assault (counts 9 and
      11) and one count of sexual interference (count 10). However, count 9 was

      complainant in counts 1 to 12 is the appellant’s stepson who was born on
      September 20, 1989 and was twelve and thirteen years old at the time of
      the abuse alleged in the indictment. The boy disclosed the sexual abuse
      to his mother on November 18, 2003. That same day, he provided a videotaped
      statement to police. His testimony at trial, which was in all material
      respects essentially the same as his evidence on the videotape, disclosed
      six separate incidents of sexual abuse. </span></p>

      to the complainant, the six incidents of sexual abuse occurred in specific

      following conduct:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(i)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       Counts 1 and 2 – December 2001 – the appellant fondled the

      erect penis;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(ii)</span><span
lang=EN-US>      Counts 3 and 4 – January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2002 – the appellant
      forced the boy’s hand down his (the appellant’s) pants; kissed the boy
      on the lips using his tongue; rubbed his erect penis on the boy and ejaculated
      on the boy’s back;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(iii)</span><span
lang=EN-US>     Counts 5 and 6 – March 1, 2002 to August 31, 2002 – the appellant
      performed fellatio on the boy in the boy’s bedroom; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(iv)</span><span
lang=EN-US>      Counts 7 and 8 – April 1, 2002 to September 30, 2002 – while
      the boy was staying at the appellant’s apartment the appellant put a pornographic
      videotape in his VCR and told the boy to watch it. He began kissing the
      boy. The appellant then lay naked on top of the boy and ejaculated on the
      boy’s stomach;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(v)</span><span
lang=EN-US>       Counts 9 and 10 – May 1, 2003 to August 31, 2003 – the appellant
      set up a computer in the boy’s room and showed him pornographic pictures.
      After this incident the appellant forced the boy onto the floor, fondled
      his genitalia and had anal intercourse with him. (A forensic computer expert
      recovered 2,481 pornographic images from the computer, including approximately
      500 images of child pornography); and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(vi)</span><span
lang=EN-US>      Counts 11 and 12 – August 2003 – while the appellant was looking
      at pornographic pictures on the computer he forced the boy to masturbate
      him.</span></p>

      trial, the appellant admitted to engaging in two sexual acts with his stepson
      during which he ejaculated on the boy’s body. The appellant also admitted
      to three or four acts of fellatio on the boy. He claimed that the sexual
      activity did not begin until after his stepson turned fourteen in September
      2003 and that all incidents were consensual. The appellant’s admission
      of sexual activity with the boy was also set out in two separate letters
      to his wife written in January 2004. In both letters, the appellant repeatedly
      asserted that the incidents were consensual but was not specific with respect
      to timing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:

      reviewing the evidence, the trial judge acquitted the appellant on counts
      1 to 8. In doing so she said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            On the whole of the
      evidence I have difficulty accepting [the complainant’s] evidence that
      there were only six separate and isolated incidents of sexual assault as
      he has described. It may be that these were incidents which particularly
      stood out and that sexual abuse was ongoing for this whole period. However,
      that is not what he said in his testimony. Given the discrepancies in [the
      complainant’s] testimony, I simply cannot be sure that the incidents alleged
      in 2001 and 2002 occurred. I will go so far as to say it is likely or probable
      they occurred at some point during this time period, but I am simply not
      satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. I am therefore acquitting [the accused]
      of counts 1 through 8.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge then considered the charges from 2003 – counts 9, 10, 11, 12
      and 13. She rejected the appellant’s denial of the charges and concluded
      that there was sexual abuse in the summer of 2003. In doing so, she said: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Given the extent of
      the abuse and the number of incidents, which even [the appellant] concedes,
      it is not plausible that they all occurred in the short period of time
      between September 19 and November 17…There would not have been five or
      six occasions in that timeframe when [the appellant] and [the boy] were
      alone in that apartment for a sufficient period of time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Later
      in her reasons, the trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            I do not believe [the
      appellant’s] testimony at trial that the sexual contact only started after
      [the boy’s] 14th birthday. Further, his evidence does not even cause me
      to have a reasonable doubt about that. I am certain there was sexual abuse
      during the summer of 2003. It is probable the abuse had been ongoing well
      before the summer of 2003, likely for years. However, I am not satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt as to that. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
      doubt, however, that there was more than one incident of sexual touching
      during the summer of 2003, prior to [the boy’s] 14th birthday.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Having determined
      that the sexual acts constituting such touching for a sexual purpose took
      place while [the boy] was under the age of 14, the offences charged in
      the counts relating to 2003 are proven.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge concluded her reasons on conviction by referring to the sexual
      conduct that the appellant admitted took place in the period following
      the boy’s fourteenth birthday up to the time of his arrest – September
      19, 2003 to November 19, 2003:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Finally, [the appellant]
      has admitted to having engaged in sexual activity with [the complainant]
      between September 19, 2003, and November 19th, 2003. He acknowledges he
      knew this was wrong because [the complainant] is his stepson. He acknowledges
      he is the only father [the complainant] has ever known and he has been
      a prominent figure in [the complainant’s] life from the age of 5 with the
      exception of some period of time in 2002. [The complainant] called him
      Dad. He was clearly a person with authority over [the complainant] and
      in a position of trust. In this context, all of the elements of sexual
      exploitation under s. 153 of the <u>Criminal Code</u> are met, even though
      there is no charge under that section in the indictment.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Further, in my view,
      the evidence clearly establishes an offence under s. 271 of the <u>Criminal
      Code</u>, the offence of sexual assault. [The appellant] asserts that [the
      complainant] “consented”
    to the sexual activity. [The complainant] was a vulnerable child, whether
    he was 13 or 14. [The appellant] was his stepfather and knew this conduct
    was wrong. The despicable conduct over many months in respect of pornography
    can properly be seen as a process of “grooming” or desensitizing [the complainant]
    to what was to follow. In this context it was not necessary for [the complainant]
    to fight back or to refuse to engage in this sexual contact with his stepfather.
    [The appellant] was in a position of trust and authority and he abused that
    position of trust to further his own perverted desires.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            During periods of
      court ordered access, he exposed [the complainant] to disgusting pornographic
      material and ultimately led him into overt sexual activity with his own
      stepfather. Even if [the complainant] failed to struggle in that situation,
      this cannot be characterized as “consent”. The power balance in that relationship
      was such that [the appellant] cannot rely on [the complainant’s] acquiescence
      as a true consent to sexual activity. That would be precluded in my view
      under s. 273.1(2)(c) of the <u>Criminal Code.</u> </span></p>

      trial judge then said that she would be convicting the appellant on “some
      counts” and invited both counsel to make submissions on which counts she
      should register convictions. The court adjourned for twenty minutes. On
      the return to court, the Crown Attorney, Mr. Ball, said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>MR. BALL:    It seems to me that
      based on your findings that sexual activity occurred both before [the complainant’s]
      14th birthday, that is in the summer of 2003, and after [the complainant’s]
      birthday in the narrow gap between the birthday and the arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT: That is right.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>MR. BALL:    That a reasonable
      way to deal with counts 9 to 12 would be the following, that findings of
      guilt can reasonably follow on counts 9 and 10 relating to the period before
      the 14th birthday. That a finding of guilt can apply to count 11 based
      on Your Honour’s finding that even once he turned 14 he was not in a position
      to give meaningful consent, given the provisions of the <u>Code</u> relating
      to persons in authority. If we take count 12 to relate to the period after
      the 14th birthday, then count 12 does not apply because sexual interference
      is clearly limited to complainants under 14. For that reason I would suggest
      that the indictment could be marked findings of guilt on counts 9, 10,
      11 and 13, which Your Honour has already commented on, and to which [the
      appellant] pled guilty. And regarding counts 9 and 10, since they relate
      to the same delict, <u>Kienapple</u> does come into play, and I would ask
      that you enter a stay on count 9 so that we have convictions on counts
      10, 11 and 13.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT:  What about the time
      alleged in count 11? It says August of 2003.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>MR. BALL:    Yes. And as I understand
      it, Your Honour, the timing is not an essential averment except when it
      becomes an essential element of the offence. It is not an essential element
      of the sexual assault and that’s why I suggest that count 12 -- </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THE COURT:  Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>MR. BALL:    --could be registered
      as a not guilty just on the basis that the last sexual contact happened
      after [the complainant] had turned 14, as you found, and therefore sexual
      touching does not apply.</span></p>

    in charges of sexual assault but are considered mere surplusage <i>R. v.
    B.(G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30 at 53. However, that general rule does not
    apply where the occurrence of specific events and specific dates are matters
    critical to the preparation of the defence and where regarding them as surplusage
    would prejudice the accused. See <i>R. v. Vézina</i> [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2 at

    this case, the fact that the allegations predated the boy’s fourteenth birthday
    was critical because the case against the appellant related solely to pre-fourteenth-birthday
    conduct and did not involve any issues relating to consent. In particular,
    since no count in the indictment, and none of the prior testimony at trial,
    related to sexual misconduct occurring after the important date of the boy’s
    fourteenth birthday, it was unnecessary for the appellant to make a choice
    concerning how to defend allegations that he sexually assaulted the boy after
    that date. In our view, the appellant suffered prejudice akin to that occasioned
    by the effective nullification of an alibi defence in response to a specific
    date in the indictment. See <i>R. v. Parkin</i> (1922), 37 C.C.C. 35 (

      the trial judge’s findings fully support a finding of guilt on count 11
      as it was originally framed for events that took place before the boy’s
      fourteenth birthday. In particular, the trial judge made a specific finding
      that “there was more than one incident of sexual touching during the summer
      of 2003” and that
    “the offences charged in the counts relating to 2003 are proven.” Further,
    as the trial was conducted on the basis of count 11 as it was originally
    framed, we see no basis for concluding that appellant was misled or would
    in any way be prejudiced if convicted of count 11 as originally framed. </span></p>

      3 to 6. We disagree. In our view, there was more than sufficient evidence
      to support the findings of guilt on counts 9 and 10. These counts involved
      sexual abuse of the boy in the summer of 2003. There was evidence that

    the appellant’s convictions, the Crown brought a Dangerous Offender application.
    For the purposes of this application, the appellant was assessed by two psychiatrists,
    Dr. Woodside for the Crown and Dr. Gojer for the defence. Dr. Woodside gave
    oral evidence at the hearing and his report was filed as an exhibit. With
    the Crown’s consent, the defence filed Dr. Gojer’s report as an exhibit.

    her reasons for sentence, the trial judge concluded that the criteria for
    designation as a dangerous offender had been satisfied and she rejected the
    appellant’s submission that he should be designated as a long-term offender.
    In making these determinations, the trial judge reviewed the appellant’s
    circumstances, including his extensive criminal record, which contained entries
    both for assault and for sexual assault (the most significant convictions
    were for sexual assault with a weapon and uttering threats in relation to
    his stepdaughter from a previous relationship, for which he received a total
    sentence of four and a half years’ imprisonment). </p>

    trial judge also noted the appellant’s
    “violent and explosive” temper, his difficulties with anger management, and
    his history of alcohol and drug abuse. In addition, she accepted the evidence
    of both psychiatrists that the appellant is a pedophile with a non-exclusive
    “sexually deviant preference for children, both male and female, and both
    pubescent and pre-pubescent” (meaning the appellant is properly diagnosed
    as having pedohebephilia) and their diagnosis of anti-social personality

    after reviewing the case law and statutory provisions relating to long-term
    offenders and dangerous offenders, the trial judge considered the evidence
    regarding the appellant’s risk of re-offence and the prospects of his eventual
    control in the community. She concluded that there “is a substantial likelihood
    [the appellant] will commit similarly harmful crimes in the future” and that
    he meets the criteria for designation as a dangerous offender. </p>

    offender criteria. While she concluded that the appellant meets the first
    two criteria, she found that there was not a reasonable possibility of eventual
    control of the risk in the community. To the extent that the evidence of
    the two psychiatrists could be interpreted as suggesting such a reasonable
    possibility, she rejected that opinion. After setting out her analysis of
    their evidence, she said:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Ultimately, the decision
    as to whether there is a “reasonable possibility of eventual control of the

    assistance in cases of this nature. However, I am not bound to accept the
    opinions of the experts if I find them to be unpersuasive or unsupported
    by the evidence. I do not lightly discount the opinions of these two experts.

    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by misapprehending the risk
    management evidence that was presented at the hearing and the legal significance
    of that evidence. According to the appellant, the risk management evidence
    addressed both his treatment prospects and the availability and potential
    efficacy of <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>treatment and</span> supervision
    in the community. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by focussing
    almost exclusively on the question of whether his (the appellant’s) risk
    could be successfully reduced by treatment and either improperly discounted
    or ignored the evidence relating to the efficacy of supervision. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, the appellant claims that the trial judge erred by failing to
    make any reference to the evidence of Dr. Robin Wilson, Correctional Services
    Canada’s chief psychologist for the Ontario Region. The appellant says that
    Dr. Wilson’s evidence was the centrepiece of his defence and demonstrated,
    in conjunction with the evidence of other witnesses, that the appellant’s
    risk could be adequately controlled through supervision. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Wilson testified about both the treatment programs available for individuals
    such as the appellant while in the penitentiary and about the type of supervision
    that the appellant could expect under a long-term supervision order. Relevant
    to these issues, he provided empirical data demonstrating the effectiveness,
    from a risk management standpoint, of the community-based government treatment/supervision
    program he headed. In addition, Dr. Wilson spoke about the work of a community
    program called Circles of Support and Accountability, about the effects of
    being in a Circle and about the results of a study that demonstrated that “there
    is a significant difference in the actual rate of re-offending between those
    who were in a Circle and those who were not”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span

    appellant contends that as the result of failing to either advert to or appreciate
    the significance of this evidence, the trial judge essentially overlooked
    the prospects of managing the appellant’s risk through supervision. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this submission. In our view, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate
    that she was fully aware of Dr. Wilson’s evidence in particular, as well
    as the other evidence that was presented concerning the scope of the available
    community supervision. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, the trial judge alluded to Dr. Wilson’s evidence at four points
    in her reasons: first, in an overall list of the evidence presented at the
    hearing; second, when referring to the procedures that Corrections Canada
    would follow in dealing with the appellant; third, when outlining the graduated
    release program that would be available if the appellant were placed on a
    long-term supervision order; and fourth, when noting the very good track
    record of Circles of Support and Accountability. Accordingly, the trial judge
    was clearly alert to Dr. Wilson’s evidence with respect to community supervision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    contrary to the appellant’s submission, in our view, it was unnecessary that
    the trial judge focus on the empirical evidence presented by Dr. Wilson concerning
    the statistical successes of various programs. While that evidence was important
    in providing a backdrop to other evidence concerning the potential for effective
    supervision, in our view, it did not address the specific issue of the reasonable
    possibility of eventually controlling the risk presented by the appellant
    in the community. Dr. Wilson could not give that evidence because she had
    never met the appellant. Rather, the psychiatric evidence to which we have
    referred provided specific evidence concerning the prospects for eventually
    controlling the appellant’s risk in the community—and the trial judge reviewed
    that evidence extensively. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in basing her rejection
    of the appellant’s release plan on her speculative fear that the supervision
    and support offered to the appellant by Circles of Support and Accountability
    might not be available to the appellant by the time of his release and on
    her assessment that the continued availability of that support was “uncertain.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, the appellant points out that the trial judge found there was
    no clear evidence that the support program currently offered by Circles of
    Support and Accountability would continue to be available upon the appellant’s
    release after he served a determinate sentence of four to six years. As well,
    in making that finding, the trial judge noted that Circles, which is a community-run
    program, is dependent on the availability of both volunteers and government
    funding. The appellant submits that the trial judge was required to make
    her decision on the basis of currently available programs and was not permitted
    to speculate that those programs would not continue to receive adequate funding. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this submission. Even if the appellant is correct that the
    trial judge erred in questioning the continued viability of Circles, in our
    view, her finding in this respect was not critical to her analysis. In expressing
    her reservations about the program, the trial judge expressed specific concern
    about Circles’ ability “to absorb the extreme demands that managing [the
    appellant] would require.”  In our view, it was this concern about Circles’
    inability to provide the necessary close supervision of the appellant that
    was relevant to the reasonable possibility of managing his risk in the community. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Encompassed
    in the issue of the available scope of Circles’ supervision is the question
    of its ability to monitor the appellant’s recommended medication and his
    use of alcohol and drugs. On the issue of the scope of the necessary supervision,
    both experts (particularly Dr. Woodside) referred to the need for anti-androgen
    medication as part of the appellant’s supervision plan. Indeed, Dr. Woodside
    gave the opinion that without such medication on a lifelong basis the appellant
    would be “very clearly unmanageable within the community.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Anti-androgen
    medication would normally be administered by injection and monitored by extraction
    of blood samples. However, the evidence about the appellant’s willingness
    to comply with this medication regime was that he would only agree to take
    the medication orally; he had a phobia about needles. While there was evidence
    that his phobia would be amenable to treatment, there was no evidence about
    the appellant’s willingness to undergo that treatment or his ability to tolerate
    the medication. Toleration was an issue because the medication can adversely
    affect a patient’s bones and the appellant suffered from a pre-existing back
    condition. In any event, even assuming the medication could be tolerated
    there remained the essential requirement of monitoring the appellant’s compliance
    with the medication.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this issue, Elizabeth Henderson, Circles’
    Program Manager, testified that  Circles’
    volunteers would not be in a position either to monitor the appellant’s necessary
    daily ingestion of pills or to provide the random checks necessary to ensure
    his abstention from alcohol and drugs. As the trial judge said, Circles is “largely
    dependent upon the offender self-reporting breaches or upon finding out about
    breaches by coincidence.”  Further, the Circle volunteers “do not do random
    spot-checks to ensure the offender is compliant with his conditions.”</p>

    addition, the trial judge was entitled to balance the appellant’s profession
    that he would take the medication, at least orally, with his history of his
    deceitfulness and manipulation, spawned by his anti-social personality disorder. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in rejecting the opinion
    expressed in Dr. Gojer’s report without first alerting the defence to the
    fact that she had concerns about the opinion and without giving the defence
    an opportunity to address her concerns (by, for example, calling Dr. Gojer
    as a witness and having him give oral evidence). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this regard, the appellant points out that defence counsel at trial informed
    the trial judge that he and Crown counsel had agreed that Dr. Gojer’s report
    could be filed and that the Crown did not require the opportunity to cross-examine
    Dr. Gojer. When asked if she required a copy of Dr. Gojer’s curriculum vitae,
    the trial judge indicated she did not because she was familiar with Dr. Gojer’s
    work. Further, when defence counsel referred to Dr. Gojer’s report during
    the course of oral submissions, the trial judge commented simply, “I read
    it” and asked no questions and made no comments on the contents of his report.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the approach taken by the trial judge in failing to
    give the defence any warning of her intention to reject Dr. Gojer’s report
    was fundamentally unfair. According to the appellant, the proper approach
    is the one commonly used when a sentencing judge is considering rejecting
    a joint submission—i.e., counsel are informed of the sentencing judge’s concerns
    and given the opportunity to make further submissions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept these submissions. Defence counsel at trial was well aware
    of the Crown’s position that a dangerous offender designation should be made.
    In such circumstances, it would have been obvious that the Crown contested
    Dr. Gojer’s opinion concerning the possibility of eventually controlling
    the risk presented by the appellant in the community and that it would be
    for the trial judge to make a designation based on all of the evidence adduced.
    Just as with any other witness, it is open to a trial judge to accept some,
    all or none of an expert witness’s evidence. In this case, it is apparent
    that the trial judge questioned certain assumptions contained in Dr. Gojer’s
    report in light of other evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing. In any
    event, in our view, the record makes it clear that the defence decision not
    to call Dr. Gojer was a strategic one through which the defence obtained
    the advantage of not having Dr. Gojer challenged on cross-examination. We
    see no basis for holding that the trial judge was under an obligation to
    suggest that the appellant call Dr. Gojer to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence.
    Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge improperly placed the onus on the
    defence to prove that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control
    of the appellant’s risk in the community and erred in assessing the psychiatric
    evidence on that basis. In support of his argument, the appellant cites the
    trial judge’s reference to the defence “relying” on the experts’ opinions
    and her statement that she was not
    “persuaded” that she should adopt the experts’ opinions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this argument. In our view, the trial judge’s choice of language
    must be considered in its context of responding to the appellant’s reference
    to the similar psychiatric opinions and does not reflect an impermissible
    shifting of the burden to the defence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    in her statutory analysis, the trial judge specifically noted that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            The burden remains on the Crown to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria for the dangerous offender designation
    have been met. This burden requires both proving the elements of the dangerous
    offender test <i>and ruling out the appropriateness of the long-term offender
    designation. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-align:justify'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>            In the context of a dangerous
      offender application, the issue is whether the sentencing judge should
      exercise the discretion not to declare an offender dangerous after the
      sentencing judge has found that the offender satisfies the statutory criteria
      for that designation. As I have explained, the sentencing judge <i>may </i>exercise
      that discretion<i> </i><i>where he or she is satisfied </i>that the public
      threat can be reduced to an acceptable level through either the long-term
      offender provisions or a determinate sentence. <i>This is not an issue
      that requires either party to satisfy a burden of proof; rather, it is
      an issue for the sentencing judge concerning whether to exercise his or

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since
      there is no onus on the Crown regarding the third criterion, it follows

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, the trial judge concluded her reasons by saying:  “I am not satisfied
    that the requirements for a long-term offender designation have been met.”  In
    our view, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that there was no impermissible
    shifting of the burden and this ground of appeal cannot succeed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in rejecting the common opinions
    of the experts concerning the prospects of eventually controlling the risk
    presented by the appellant in the community. According to the appellant,
    the opinions of the experts were consistent on this pivotal issue. We reject
    this submission. Among other flaws in the appellant’s argument is the assumption
    that the experts’ opinions were both consistent and unequivocal. In the trial
    judge’s view, they were not. We agree with the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    Dr. Gojer gave the opinion that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual
    control of the appellant’s risk in the community, the trial judge had difficulty
    with that opinion, including the reasons given for this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    in giving his opinion that the appellant “resembles or more closely resembles
    what I would see as a long-term offender”, Dr. Woodside raised specific concerns
    about both the appellant’s potential for treatment and his supervision. In
    his view, the issue of the appellant’s designation turned on the question
    of supervision. He considered this issue in the context of the appellant’s
    past behaviour, recognizing that the appellant posed a higher risk to children
    under his supervision (such as his stepchildren) than to children in the
    larger community. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    though he recognized the risk was thus limited, Dr. Woodside qualified his
    opinion saying:  “My <i>hope </i>would be that such an intensive level of
    supervision, while not eliminating the risk posed by Mr. M., <i>might</i> allow
    for intervention (i.e. breach) prior to his committing a further violent
    offence.” [Emphasis added.] In the trial judge’s words, this “is hardly a
    ringing endorsement” about the prospects of managing the appellant’s risk
    in the community. More importantly, Dr. Woodside’s “hope” was premised on
    a number of conditions that the trial judge was not satisfied would be met. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s concerns about the conditions that were critical to Dr. Woodside’s
    hope included the efficacy of anti-androgen medication and the supervision
    available under the Circles program, both of which are discussed earlier
    in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in our view, the trial judge was entitled, and indeed obliged,
    to reach her own conclusion about the appellant’s risk. Her determination
    of this issue was one she made after careful consideration of extensive evidence
    concerning the factual foundations that underlay the experts’ opinions, including
    the seriousness of the appellant’s criminal record for violent crimes, his
    history of predatory sexual conduct, the ineffectiveness of an earlier penitentiary
    sentence for an assault against another stepchild, the appellant’s substance
    abuse and anger management problems, the appellant’s minimization of his
    conduct and his potential for treatment and supervision in the community.  The
    trial judge’s findings on these issues are entitled to deference. In applying
    those findings to the legal question of the appropriate designation, the
    trial judge was entitled to distinguish between a reasonable possibility
    and a speculative one concerning the appellant’s eventual control in the
    community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge’s assessment of Dr. Woodside’s
    evidence was tainted because she unfairly discounted Dr. Woodside’s concession
    about eventual control and because she relied on his demeanour. We reject
    these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was clearly alive to the fact that Dr. Woodside was a Crown witness.
    In our view, the trial judge operated well within her obligation to weigh
    the evidence in concluding that Dr. Woodside’s optimism about the appellant’s
    risk could not safely be accepted based on his past conduct and the trial
    judge’s lack of satisfaction about the conditions necessary to control his
    risk in the community. In this regard, the trial judge was also entitled
    to note the tentative quality of Dr. Woodside’s evidence when he carefully
    chose his words about the appellant’s potential risk if designated a long-term
    offender in contrast to Dr. Woodside’s assured and confident testimony regarding
    the appellant’s designation as a dangerous offender. The fact that Dr. Woodside
    was a Crown witness did not mean that the trial judge was obliged to accept
    an opinion that she saw as qualified in crucial respects. Accordingly, we
    do not accept this ground of appeal.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal. </p>
