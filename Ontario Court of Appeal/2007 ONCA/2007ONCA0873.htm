    allowed the appeal and indicated that written reasons would be released a short
    time later.  These are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 5, 2007, a Health and Safety inspector laid an
    information before a justice of the peace charging the respondents with
    offences contrary to the <i>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.  At the same time the justice of the peace issued summonses returnable on
    May 2, 2007.  On May 2, no justice of the
    peace was available and nothing was done.  On May 17, 2007, a justice of the peace issued new summonses returnable
    on June 13, 2007.  The respondents
    brought an application for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to quash the summonses and prevent the Provincial Offences
    Court from taking any further proceedings in relation to the charges in the
    April 5 information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Herold J. heard the application on June 11, 2007 and
    granted the application.  He was of the
    view that jurisdiction over the information and the respondents was lost when
    nothing was done on May 2, 2007 and that the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> provides no mechanism for issuing
    successive summonses on the same information.  He did not follow the decision of this court in <i>R. v. 1283499 Ontario Inc.</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 763, which appears
    to stand for the proposition that s. 31 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> preserves jurisdiction over the information
    in circumstances such as this and that jurisdiction over the person can be
    regained by issuing new summonses.  The
    application judge was of the view that s. 31 does not preserve jurisdiction
    over the person and that the part of the reasons in <i>R. v. 1283499
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    Inc.</i> that sanctions issuing new summonses to regain jurisdiction over the
    person was <i>obiter</i> and said <i>per incuriam</i>, because Doherty J.A. did
    not refer to certain provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the application judge erred.  In fairness to the application judge, while
    we do not agree with his conclusion, it must be said that he did a commendable
    job in providing comprehensive reasons in the context of the very tight time
    frame.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in our view, the decisions in <i>R. v. 1283499 Ontario Inc. </i>and the
    companion case of <i>R. v. Colarossi</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 767 (C.A.) are dispositive of this aspect of the
    case.  Section 31 of the Act preserves
    jurisdiction over the offence and there is nothing in the Act that precludes a
    justice of the peace from issuing a new summons under s. 24 in circumstances
    such as occurred here.  As the Crown
    rightly points out, any other interpretation of the Act would render s. 31
    nugatory except in the unlikely circumstance that a defendant voluntarily
    returned to court so that jurisdiction could be regained in that fashion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Parliament has enacted provisions in s. 485 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>specifically permitting
    the issuing of successive summonses but also placing limits on the time within
    which those summonses may be issued does not affect the interpretation of a
    different piece of legislation enacted by a different legislative body.  Finally, the fact that other provisions of
    the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, such as
    ss. 54 and 98, provide additional authority, in entirely different
    circumstances, for bringing a defendant before the court by means of a summons
    or warrant, does not impact on the interpretation of ss. 24 and 31 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that issuing of new summonses was
    precluded in any event because the one year limitation period under s. 69 of
    the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> had expired prior to May 17 when the new summonses were issued.  Section 69 provides that no prosecution 
    shall be instituted more than a year after the last act upon which the
    prosecution is based occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that a prosecution is not
    instituted until an information is laid and a summons or warrant issued.  There are two answers to this argument.  First, an information was laid and summonses
    were issued prior to expiration of the limitation period.  The fact that nothing was done on the return
    date does not mean that the prosecution had not been instituted.  Second, a prosecution is instituted within
    the meaning of s. 69 once the information is laid before a justice of the peace.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents rely upon <i>Dowson v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 144 as authority for the view
    that a prosecution is not instituted until a summons is issued.  However, <i>Dowson </i>involved the quite different language of former s. 508 and concerned the power
    of the Attorney General to stay an information.  Section 508 only gave the Attorney General this power after an
    indictment has been found.  The
    difficulty faced in <i>Dowson</i> was in
    determining when an information is found, since the term found is not one
    usually associated with an information.  For policy and other reasons the court held that an information is found
    only after process has been issued.  No
    similar considerations encumber the interpretation of the phrase prosecution 
    shall be instituted and we see no reason not to give this phrase the
    well-accepted meaning that a prosecution is instituted when the information is
    laid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents also rely upon language in <i>Southam Inc. v. Coulter</i> (1990), 75 O.R.
    (2d) 1 (C.A.) where the court, referring to passages from <i>Dowson</i>, held at p. 7 that a prosecution commences only after a
    justice of the peace has decided to issue process.  It may be that in some contexts a prosecution
    only commences with the issue of process but that does not answer the question
    of when a prosecution is instituted.  The
    laying of the information before a justice of the peace is the first formal
    step taken in the proceedings before the Provincial Offences Court and in our
    view constitutes the institution of the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the orders of <i>certioriari </i>and prohibition are set
    aside and the matter is remitted to the Provincial Offences Court for
    trial.  If necessary, summonses may issue
    compelling the attendance of the respondents.</p>
