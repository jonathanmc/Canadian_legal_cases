  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wyman MacKinnon is a member of the Ontario
    Municipal Employees Retirement System (“OMERS”) plan (the “Plan”).  The Plan is a defined benefit pension plan
    for employees of municipalities and local boards throughout
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It provides pension services to about 342,000 members and 900
    employers.  It is funded by employer and
    employee contributions and earnings thereon.  As of December 31, 2003, it had assets in excess of $32 billion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Patrick S. Ryan is the General Vice President of
    the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the collective bargaining agent for a
    significant number of the Plan members.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacKinnon and Ryan filed a statement of claim in
    which they sought, on behalf of the Plan, redress for alleged acts of serious
    maladministration, including breaches of trust and fiduciary duty.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defendants in this action are the OMERS
    Board, which administers the Plan, Borealis Capital Corporation (“BCC”),
    Borealis Real Estate Management Inc. (“BREMI”), and Ian Collier, R. Michael
    Latimer and Michael Nobrega.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal arises from the disposition of two
    motions.  The first motion was brought by
    MacKinnon and Ryan under Rule 10 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  In that motion,
    MacKinnon and Ryan asked to be appointed as representative plaintiffs on behalf
    of all Plan members.  The defendants
    brought the second motion.  In it they
    sought, pursuant to Rule 21 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, to have the statement of claim struck primarily on the
    ground it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the Rule 10 motion, the motions judge held
    that Ryan was not an appropriate candidate because he was not a Plan
    member.  However, MacKinnon was held to
    be suitable and he was named as the representative plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the Rule 21 motion, the motions judge found
    that he was unable to determine whether the statement of claim disclosed
    reasonable causes of action against the various defendants.  Accordingly, he granted leave to the
    plaintiff to deliver an amended statement of claim without prejudice to the
    right of the defendants to renew their motion to strike the amended statement
    of claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of
    action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiff filed an amended statement of
    claim in which he sought, among other things, the following relief:
    declarations that the defendants had acted negligently and committed various
    breaches of fiduciary and trust duties; a declaration that the individual
    defendants had been unjustly enriched at the expense of the OMERS pension fund
    (the “Fund”); an accounting for all monies improperly paid by OMERS to the
    other defendants pursuant to a series of agreements and transactions; an order
    for equitable tracing of all monies improperly paid by OMERS to the defendants;
    an order that various agreements under which the monies had been paid were void
    by reason of illegality; and, alternatively, damages for breach of fiduciary
    duty and unjust enrichment, which monies were to be returned to the Fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defendants renewed their Rule 21
    motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By order dated August 16, 2006 (the “Order”),
    the motions judge struck:  (1) all claims
    against BCC; (2) all claims against Nobrega and Collier; (3) all but two claims
    against BREMI; and (4) all claims against Latimer save for the claim based on
    his alleged participation in the negotiation of the Management Services
    Agreement, on which more is said later.  The motions judge did not strike any claims against the OMERS
    Board.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph 6 of the Order provides that the
    determination of remedies, as sought in the amended statement of claim, is
    reserved to the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In an order dated January 19, 2007 (the “Costs
    Order”), the motions judge ordered that no costs were payable in respect of the
    Rule 10 motion.  He ordered costs of the
    Rule 21 motion in favour of BCC, Collier and Nobrega, payable from the Fund.  BREMI’s and Latimer’s costs were reserved to
    the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacKinnon appeals.  He asks this court to set aside those
    paragraphs in the Order which strike the action as against the various
    defendants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>BCC also appeals.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  It asks the court to set aside paragraph 6 of
    the Order, which permits the plaintiff to pursue the remedies sought against
    it.  BCC argues that it is an error to
    permit the plaintiff to pursue remedies against it in the absence of a cause of
    action against it remaining in the amended statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacKinnon also seeks leave to appeal the Costs
    Order.  He asks that his full costs of
    the Rule 10 and Rule 21 motions be ordered payable by the defendants or the
    Fund.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  BCC
    cross-appeals the Costs Order, asking that the costs ordered in its favour be
    made payable by MacKinnon, rather than the Fund.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    MacKinnon appeal in part and dismiss the BCC appeal.  I would grant leave to appeal the Costs Order
    and allow the costs appeal.  I would
    dismiss the cross-appeal on costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For ease of reference, the following terms are
    used in the balance of these reasons: all of the defendants, including the
    OMERS Board, are the “Defendants”; all of the defendants, excluding the OMERS
    Board, are the “Respondents”; BCC and BREMI are the “Corporate Defendants”; and
    Collier, Latimer and Nobrega are the “Individual Defendants”.</p>
  <h3>THE PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO A RULE 21 MOTION TO STRIKE A PLEADING</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties agree on the hurdle that must be met
    on a Rule 21 motion brought to strike a pleading as disclosing no reasonable cause
    of action:  the moving party must show
    that it is plain and obvious that the claim could not succeed at trial  (<i>Hunt
    v. Carey Canada Inc</i>., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959).  That is, as the motions judge properly recognized, a claim is not to be
    struck as disclosing no reasonable cause of action unless it is “plain, obvious
    and beyond doubt that the claim will not succeed”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The following principles apply to a Rule 21
    motion to strike a pleading:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

style='"Times New Roman"'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The material facts pleaded must be deemed to be
    proven or true, except to the extent that the alleged facts are patently
    ridiculous or incapable of proof;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claim incorporates by reference any document
    pleaded and the court is entitled to read and rely on the terms of such
    documents as if they were fully quoted in the pleadings;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Novelty of the cause of action is of no concern
    at this stage of the proceeding;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

style='"Times New Roman"'>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The statement of claim must be read generously
    to allow for drafting deficiencies; and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the claim has some chance of success, it must
    be permitted to proceed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is well settled law that the threshold for
    sustaining a pleading on a Rule 21 motion is not high.</p>
  <h3>THE FACTS AS PLEADED  </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All of the following facts are taken from the
    amended statement of claim.  In
    accordance with the applicable legal principles, they are deemed to be
    proven.  Thus, even though they are
    allegations at this stage of the proceedings, they are set out as if they have
    been proven. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    company.  It changed its name to Dorset

    grossly understated value of approximately $11 million for OMERS’ real estate
    management business and agreed to manage OMERS’ real estate assets.  OMERS agreed to pay $3.7 million of BREMI’s
    start-up costs.  OMERS also agreed to pay

    services purported to have been rendered and grossly in excess of market rates
    or of the costs that OMERS would have incurred had it continued to manage its
    real estate assets internally.  These
    fees resulted in excessive compensation to the Corporate Defendants and their
    senior officers and shareholders, including the Individual Defendants. </p>

    terminate the Management Agreement and repatriate the assets being managed by
    BREMI.  The costs to the OMERS Plan were
    enormous.  In addition to the $62 million
    in fees that it had paid to BREMI and/or BCC, on February 23, 2004, OMERS
    bought the shares of BCC that it did not already own for $49.9 million.  OMERS also paid $5 million to each of
    Collier, Nobrega, and Latimer to satisfy its contractual obligations under the
    Buy-out Agreements and/or buy-out settlements.  The buy-out settlements also guaranteed Collier, Nobrega and Latimer
    continuous employment.  As a result, each
    of the Individual Defendants became CEOs of wholly owned subsidiaries of OMERS.
     In 2004, Nobrega was CEO of Borealis
    Infrastructure Corp., Latimer was CEO of Oxford Properties Group, and Collier

    the Defendants are as follows.  Prior to
    the delegation of its real estate management functions to BREMI, those
    functions were performed internally by OMERS through its wholly owned and
    controlled companies.  The decision to
    outsource the real estate management services was taken by an inadequately
    informed OMERS Board and driven by the personal compensation interests of the
    Individual Defendants who were current or former employees of OMERS or its
    affiliates and who were aware of OMERS’ fiduciary role in respect of Plan
    members and the Fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The OMERS Board breached its fiduciary
    obligations and duty of care to the Plan members by entering into the various
    imprudent agreements.  The various
    agreements are void by reason of illegality and as being contrary to public policy.  The fees and payments made by the OMERS
    Board, pursuant to those agreements, were exorbitant and constituted breaches
    of trust.  </p>

    having received fees and compensation that were incommensurate with the
    services rendered.  These payments resulted
    in excessive compensation to the Corporate Defendants and their senior officers
    and shareholders, including the Individual Defendants.  The Individual Defendants were unjustly
    enriched, having received excessive amounts as salaries, share dividends and
    the proceeds of sale of their BCC shares.    </p>

    fees, salary, dividends, commissions or the transfer of equity, to the
    Respondents and to require the Respondents to disgorge the funds.  If any of the proceeds are not traceable, the

  <h3>THE CAUSES OF ACTION</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I understand the plaintiff to assert, through the
    amended statement of claim, the following claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The OMERS Board acted negligently and in breach
    of its fiduciary and trust duties by entering into various improvident
    agreements (previously described) and by making exorbitant payments pursuant to
    those agreements.  Each of the
    Respondents is liable for breach of fiduciary obligation at common law, as
    agents of the OMERS Board or as “related parties” of the OMERS Board (the
    “breach of fiduciary obligation” claims);</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents knowingly received trust
    property that was conveyed in breach of trust (the “knowing receipt of trust
    property” claims);</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents knowingly assisted the OMERS
    Board, a trustee, in breach of trust (the “knowing assistance” claims); and,</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents were unjustly enriched (the
    “unjust enrichment” claims).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, it is fair to say that there is some
    confusion as to what claims the motions judge considered in relation to each
    defendant and what determination was made in respect of the claims.  For example, paragraph 1 of the Order strikes
    “all claims against” BCC.  However, I see
    nothing in the reasons of the motions judge to indicate that he considered
    whether claims based on knowing receipt, knowing assistance or unjust enrichment
    could proceed as against BCC (or, indeed, any of the Defendants).  Rather, it appears that the motions judged
    viewed the asserted claims to be limited to the breach of fiduciary obligation
    claims and that matters such as unjust enrichment related only to the remedies
    that had been sought.  Given the sheer
    volume of asserted claims and the unfocussed nature of the amended statement of
    claim, the motions judge can scarcely be faulted for this.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacKinnon argues that because the motions judge
    expressly stated that the remedies sought in the amended statement of claim
    were left for determination by the trial judge, the motions judge was
    implicitly permitting the claims based on knowing receipt, knowing assistance
    and unjust enrichment to proceed.  Given that
    an appeal lies from orders and judgments, not from reasons,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> I have
    proceeded on the basis of the plain wording of the Order.  Thus, for example, as paragraph 1 of the
    Order strikes all claims against BCC, I have assumed that the motions judge
    intended to strike all claims against BCC, not only those based on fiduciary
    and trust duties.        </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I explain below, although I agree with the
    motions judge that certain of the breach of fiduciary obligation claims ought
    to be struck, I am of the view that the balance of the claims must be permitted
    to proceed.</p>
  <h3><span class=BoldItalics><span style='font-style:normal'>THE BREACH OF
    FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION CLAIMS</span></span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge permitted all claims against
    the OMERS Board to proceed.  That
    determination has not been appealed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge also permitted the claims
    against BREMI, based on fees paid pursuant to the Management Agreement, to
    proceed.  In addition, he permitted the
    claim against Latimer, based on Latimer’s alleged participation in the
    negotiation of the Management Agreement on behalf of the OMERS Board, to
    proceed.  Again, no appeal is taken from
    these determinations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacKinnon argues that the motions judge erred in
    striking out the other claims based on fiduciary obligation.  He argues that the Respondents owed fiduciary
    obligations to the Plan members: at common law; as agents of the OMERS Board
    pursuant to s. 22 of the <i>Pension Benefits
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (the “PBA”) and/or the <i>Trustee Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23; and, as related parties pursuant
    to the provisions of the Federal Investment Regulations (“FIR”).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will consider each possible source of duties
    for each defendant.  In doing this
    analysis, it is important to keep in mind the alleged wrongdoing of the OMERS
    Board – (1) entering into improvident agreements, particularly the Management Agreement,
    and (2) payment of exorbitant sums due to the outsourcing of the management of
    the real estate assets and repatriation of the same.       </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            1.         Fiduciary Obligation based on the Common
    Law<i></i></span></h4>
  <h3>            BCC</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge correctly concluded, in my
    view, that there are no material facts pleaded which would support the finding
    that BCC owed a fiduciary or other duty to the Plan members or that the common
    law would recognise such a duty.  BCC
    owed no fiduciary obligation when it negotiated agreements on its own
    behalf.  For the same reason, there is
    nothing in the making of payments by the OMERS Board that can translate into a
    fiduciary obligation on the part of BCC at common law.</p>
  <h3>            BREMI </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge permitted the claim against
    BREMI to proceed based on the fees it received.  I understand the motions judge to have permitted the claim to proceed on
    the basis of the PBA provisions governing agents.  As I explain below, I agree with the motions
    judge’s determination in that regard.  As
    BREMI was not in existence when the Management Agreement was negotiated, it is
    not possible that a claim based on fiduciary duty could exist in relation to
    that matter.     </p>
  <h3>            The Individual Defendants</h3>
  <h3>            Collier and Nobrega</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge struck the asserted claims of
    breach of a fiduciary or other duty owed by Collier and Nobrega to the OMERS
    Board or the Plan members.  I agree, for
    the reasons given by the motions judge.  As he explains in paras. 22 through 25 of the reasons:  Collier and Nobrega were former OMERS
    employees when the Management Agreement was negotiated; fiduciary duties owed
    by former employees have generally been confined to improper use of
    confidential information, trade secrets and customer lists, seizing corporate
    opportunities or improperly soliciting customers; and, while there is a bald
    assertion in the amended statement of claim that Collier and Nobrega misused
    confidential information, there are no facts pleaded to show that they engaged
    in that or other similar types of activities.  I would simply note that the assertion remained a bald statement,
    without facts to support it, despite the plaintiff having been given the
    opportunity to amend the statement of claim.  In the circumstances, even if the intent were to assert some type of
    novel claim, there is no basis to interfere with the motions judge’s
    determination.       </p>
  <h3>            Latimer</h3>

    22(5) of the PBA.  Might the word “agent”
    in s. 22(5) extend to encompass BCC in respect of the performance of the
    Management Agreement?  It is a novel
    argument but not one that can be said to be without any chance of success given
    the following:  BREMI, as explained
    below, may be an agent in respect of management services and receipt of fees;
    BCC signed the Management Agreement to guarantee BREMI’s performance; BREMI is
    a wholly owned subsidiary of BCC; BCC received financial benefits, directly or
    indirectly, for the performance of that agreement; agency is a fact specific
    determination to be made after a consideration of all surrounding
    circumstances; and, the policy reasons behind s. 22, coupled with the type of
    close relationship that existed between BCC and BREMI, may dictate such an
    interpretation.  The novelty of a claim
    is not a bar to its proceeding at this point.  Accordingly, I would not strike the fiduciary claim against BCC, as it
    relates to the performance of the Management Agreement, which is based on s. 22

    employ an agent to carry out “any act required to be done” in the
    administration of the plan or fund.  The
    OMERS Board is the administrator and had the obligation to manage the Fund real
    estate assets.  BREMI managed the OMERS’
    real estate assets on behalf of the OMERS Board.  Consequently, I agree with the motions judge
    that there are facts pleaded to support the claim that BREMI was an agent
    within the meaning of s. 22 of the PBA in relation to the performance of the
    property management services (but not with respect to the negotiation of the
    Management Agreement).  </p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsection 22(8) makes agents subject to the
    same standards that apply to the administrator under ss. 22(1), (2) and
    (4).  As agent, by virtue of s. 22(11),
    BREMI could receive no more than the “usual and reasonable fees and expenses
    for the services provided”.  Accordingly,
    as the motions judge held, the claim against BREMI for breach of duty pursuant
    to s. 22 of the PBA must be allowed to proceed.</p>
  <h3>            The Individual Defendants</h3>
  <h3><i>            </i>Collier
    and Nobrega</h3>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These individuals cannot be agents for the
    purposes of the negotiation of the various agreements.  Can they be held to be agents for the
    purposes of the payment of fees?  It does
    not appear possible, in my view.  Section
    22(5) is clear:  to be an agent, the
    person must be employed by the administrator of the pension plan to carry out
    any act required to be done in the administration of the plan or fund.  Collier and Nobrega were not employed by the
    OMERS Board at any of the relevant times nor is it alleged that they were.  </p>
  <h3>            Latimer</h3>

    Latimer was an agent, within the meaning of s. 22(5) when the Management
    Agreement was negotiated.  He was
    employed by the OMERS Board at that time and allegedly assisted in the
    negotiation of the Management Services Agreement.  Obtaining a management services agreement in
    respect of the OMERS real estate assets is an act required to be done in the
    administration of the Plan and Fund.  </p>

    breach of fiduciary obligation claim against Latimer is to proceed both at
    common law and pursuant to s. 22 of the PBA.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    of fiduciary duty with the exception of the claim based on s. 22 of the PBA and
    which relate to the performance of the various agreements, not their
    negotiation.  I would permit the breach of
    fiduciary claims against BREMI based on the common law, s. 22 and the related
    party provisions in FIR to proceed in relation to the performance of the
    management agreement.  I would permit the
    claims against Latimer in relation to the negotiation of the Management
    Agreement to proceed on all bases (duties owed at common law, pursuant to s. 22
    of the PBA and pursuant to the related party provisions of FIR).  I would strike the breach of fiduciary
    obligation claims against Collier and Nobrega.  </p>
  <h3>THE KNOWING RECEIPT OF TRUST PROPERTY CLAIMS </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To establish the knowing receipt of trust
    property claim, the plaintiff must prove in respect of each Respondent that (1)
    the Respondent received trust property for its or his own benefit, (2) with
    knowledge that the property was transferred (3) in breach of trust.  The Respondents, as recipients of trust
    funds, may be strangers to the trust and need owe no duties to the
    beneficiaries.  The knowledge requirement
    is satisfied if the recipient had knowledge of facts sufficient to put a
    reasonable person on notice or inquiry.  It is immaterial whether the breach of trust was fraudulent.  Liability for this type of claim is
    restitution based.  See <i>Citadel General Assurance Co. v. Lloyd’s
    Bank of Canada</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 805.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the factual summary set out above shows,
    facts have been pleaded in the amended statement of claim to support each
    element of these claims.  (1) The
    Respondents each received payments from the Fund.  That is, they received trust property for
    their own benefit.  (2) The Respondents
    knew that the OMERS Board, as the Plan administrator, was a fiduciary and was
    dealing with trust fund assets.  On the
    facts as pleaded, each of the Respondents knew or ought to have known that the
    impugned payments amounted to a breach of fiduciary or trust obligations that
    the OMERS Board owed to the Plan members.  (3)  The claims against the OMERS
    Board have been permitted to proceed.  Those claims include breach of fiduciary and trust obligation by the
    OMERS Board by virtue of entering into the various agreements and making the
    various payments.  By allowing these
    claims against the OMERS Board to continue – and no appeal has been taken from
    this - it is apparent that the potential exists for a finding that the OMERS
    Board entered into the agreements and made the payments in breach of
    trust.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the Respondents may defend the claims on
    the basis that the payments were received in good faith, for value, and without
    notice of the breach of trust, it cannot be said, on the facts as pleaded, that
    it is plain and obvious that the claims based on knowing receipt of trust
    property cannot succeed at trial.  For
    example, if it is found that BREMI was an agent and received fees in excess of
    those permitted by s. 22(11) of the PBA, it was a breach of fiduciary
    obligation for the OMERS Board to have paid such fees.  As all parties were aware of the fiduciary
    role of the OMERS Board and the role that BREMI played in investing Fund real
    estate assets, that may be sufficient to amount to notice of the breach of
    trust.        </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the knowing receipt claims constitute
    causes of action on which equitable tracing orders and other remedies may be
    sought.  Accordingly, these claims
    against the Respondents ought not to have been struck on the Rule 21
    motion.     </p>
  <h3>THE KNOWING ASSISTANCE CLAIMS</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A claim for knowing assistance must plead facts
    to support the allegation that a stranger to the trust, who had actual
    knowledge or was wilfully blind to the fact that the property was transferred
    to him or her in breach of trust, assisted in a fraudulent or dishonest breach
    of trust.  See <i>Citadel General Assurance Co., supra</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Much of the reasoning given in relation to the
    knowing receipt claims applies also to the knowing assistance claims.  There are facts pleaded that support each
    element of the knowing assistance claim against each Respondent.  Each of the Respondents received trust
    property.  The allegation is that each
    had actual knowledge or was wilfully blind to the fact that the property was
    being transferred to it or him in breach of trust.  Each is alleged to have assisted the OMERS
    Board in the breach of trust through their participation in the formation of
    the “illegal” agreements and their receipt of allegedly improper payments of
    trust funds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, the claims that the Respondents knowingly
    assisted the OMERS Board in various breaches of trust must be allowed to
    proceed.  </p>
  <h3>THE UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIMS</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly, in my view, the claim based on unjust
    enrichment must be permitted to proceed in respect of all of the
    Respondents.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In order to succeed in a claim based on unjust
    enrichment, the plaintiff must establish, in respect of each of the
    Respondents, that:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    was no juristic reason for the enrichment.<a

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the summary of the facts pleaded in the
    amended statement of claim shows, each of the Respondents is alleged to have
    received money from the Fund – that is, each was enriched to the detriment of
    the Fund.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What is in dispute is whether there was a
    juristic reason for the enrichment.  A
    dispute, however, does not make it plain and obvious that the claim of unjust
    enrichment cannot succeed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Take, for example, the allegedly exorbitant fees
    that BREMI received for managing the OMERS real estate assets.  BREMI is likely to claim that the Management
    Agreement is the juristic reason for those fees.  However, if BREMI is the agent of the OMERS
    Board within the meaning of s. 22 of the PBA, s. 22(11) prevents BREMI from
    receiving more than “the usual and reasonable fees and expenses for the
    services provided”.  Accordingly, if
    payments were made in excess of that which was reasonable, a court may conclude
    that BREMI could not rely on the Management Agreement as a juristic reason for
    those fees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the Management Agreement may be void
    for illegality, as is alleged by the plaintiff.  It may be novel to argue that illegality extends to the type of
    agreements in question but novelty does not prevent the claim from proceeding
    at this stage of the litigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The strictures that may surround BREMI’s ability
    to claim legal entitlement to fees have implications for the balance of the
    Respondents.  For example, as a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of BCC, there is a relationship between BREMI and BCC
    such that monies received by BREMI may be traceable to BCC, as the parent
    company, in the form of dividends, increased share prices or otherwise.  These facts lay the basis for a claim that
    BCC was enriched to the detriment of the Fund and it becomes an issue whether,
    among other things, the interposition of BREMI creates a juristic reason for
    that enrichment.  Further, and in any
    event, the claim is that some of the fees paid pursuant to the Management
    Agreement were made directly to BCC.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the enrichment of the Individual
    Defendants, I accept that a valid contract is a juristic reason that is fatal
    to a claim of unjust enrichment.  However, I do not accept the submission of counsel for the Individual
    Defendants that there is no allegation that the agreements relied on as
    justifying the various monetary benefits are invalid.  The amended statement of claim provides a
    factual basis for questioning the validity of the contracts relied on.  If the various agreements are held to be void
    for public policy reasons, they cannot be relied on as a juristic reason for,
    among other things, the $5 million payments to each of the Individual
    Defendants.  Again, it may be novel to
    argue that illegality extends to pension trust funds but it cannot be said that
    there is no prospect of success for such a claim.  The pleading makes clear that the agreements
    are attacked on a number of bases, including that the Individual Defendants
    assisted the OMERS Board in breach of trust by accepting payments that they
    knew were contrary to the OMERS Board’s fiduciary obligations and consequently
    that those agreements are invalid or otherwise cannot be relied on to justify
    receipt of BCC shares and salaries.   </p>

    enrichment must be allowed to proceed.</p>
  <h3>THE BCC APPEAL</h3>

  <h3>THE COSTS APPEAL<i></i></h3>

    in not awarding him costs of the motions from the Fund on a full indemnity
    basis.  He argues that because the action
    is brought for the benefit of all beneficiaries, all of his costs are properly payable
    from the Fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept this submission.  This court recently considered the issue of
    costs in pension litigation in <i>Kerry (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    )
    Inc. v. Nolan et al. </i>(2007), 282 D.L.R. (4th) 625.  In <i>Kerry</i>,
    the court explained that public policy dictates that it is appropriate to award
    costs from a pension trust fund in two categories of cases, otherwise the
    normal costs rules of civil litigation apply.  Those two categories are: (1) where the action is brought to ensure the
    due administration of the pension trust fund; and (2) where the proceedings are
    taken for the benefit of all of the beneficiaries.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the action falls within both
    categories.  The action is based on the
    alleged maladministration of the Fund.  Through the action, the plaintiff seeks redress for the
    maladministration.  That is, the
    plaintiff seeks to have the Fund restored to the position it would have been in
    had it been properly administered.  Although to date, actions in the first category have typically revolved
    around the interpretation of trust documents, I see no reason to confine it to
    such situations.  In my view, because
    this action has been brought to ensure the due administration of the pension
    fund, it falls within the first category of pension trust cases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, and in any event, it clearly falls
    within the second category.  The
    proceedings have been brought on behalf of all of the Fund beneficiaries.  As a representative plaintiff, MacKinnon is
    acting on behalf of all Plan members. – he is not adverse in interest to other
    beneficiaries.  And, the relief sought is
    for the benefit of the Fund and all Plan beneficiaries, not for his own
    personal benefit.</p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently, I would award the plaintiff costs
    of the Rule 10 motion from the Fund on a full indemnity basis.  I would not order the Defendants to pay any
    part of the costs of the Rule 10 motion both because they were successful in
    opposing Ryan being named as a representative plaintiff and because the motion
    was necessary in order for the proceeding to continue.  As the action is brought on behalf of all
    Plan beneficiaries and it was necessary in order that the proceeding continue,
    it is fair that all Plan beneficiaries share in the cost of the Rule 10
    motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Defendants brought the Rule 21 motions.  The first Rule 21 motion resulted in the
    plaintiff amending the statement of claim.  Despite the ultimate result of the Rule 21 motion, the need for
    amendment was created by the plaintiff.  Thus,
    in my view, the Defendants ought not to bear any part of the costs of that
    motion.  For the reasons already given,
    however, MacKinnon ought not to bear the costs personally and is entitled to
    such costs, on a full indemnity basis, from the Fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of the renewed Rule 21 motion, given
    the results of these appeals, the Respondents were largely unsuccessful.  As a consequence, in my view, it is
    appropriate that the Respondents pay MacKinnon’s costs of the second Rule 21
    motion on a partial indemnity basis with the balance of MacKinnon’s full
    indemnity costs to be paid from the Fund.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I wish to note that in ordering costs on a full
    indemnity basis, I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that there are no
    “checks and balances” on such costs.  At
    a minimum, such costs are to be reviewed by the court and are limited to those
    that have been reasonably incurred.    </p>
  <h3>THE COSTS CROSS-APPEAL</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It will be recalled that in the BCC cross-appeal
    on costs, BBC seeks costs of the Rule 21 motions payable by MacKinnon, rather
    than the Fund.  In light of the results
    of these appeals, the BCC cross-appeal on costs falls away.  I would simply add this.  BCC’s cross-appeal is based on its contention
    that the litigation is adversarial in nature.  Thus, the argument runs, MacKinnon ought not to be indemnified
    regardless of result achieved.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons already given, in my view, the
    motions judge correctly viewed the action as having been brought on behalf of
    all Fund beneficiaries.  Consequently, I
    share his view that if BCC had been entitled to costs of the motion, those
    costs were properly payable from the Fund and not from MacKinnon personally. </p>
  <h3>DISPOSITION </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I would allow the MacKinnon appeal
    and vary paragraphs 1 through 5 of the Order to bring them into conformity with
    these reasons.  I would dismiss the BCC
    appeal.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would grant MacKinnon leave to appeal the
    Costs Order and award costs of the motions in accordance with these reasons. I
    would dismiss the BCC cross-appeal on costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In light of MacKinnon’s success in respect of
    both appeals, he would normally be entitled to costs from the Respondents on a
    partial indemnity basis.  For the reasons
    given above, it would appear that the balance of his costs on the appeals ought
    to be paid from the Fund.  Having made
    those observations, this court agreed to accept written submissions on the
    matter of costs after the release of our reasons.  Thus, if the parties are unable to agree on
    costs of the appeals, they may make written submissions on the same, to a
    maximum of four pages in length, within fifteen days of the date of release of
    these reasons.   </p>
