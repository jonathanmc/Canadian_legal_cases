      in 1983, pursuant to an assignment by Ward in favour of Ward Inc., all
      commissions he earned were paid to his company.  Ward divided the overhead

      October 16, 1990, NAL sent a memo to Ward Inc. offering to change their
      agreement to an “88-A” Agent’s Agreement effective January, 1991.  The
      relevant portion of the memo states,
    “agents who change to the 88-A at January, 1991 will receive 5% lifetime
    renewals or service fees on their existing business which is past the commission – paying
    period.” Under the heading Vesting Clause, the memo stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Clause 9 of the 88-A contract,
    “Commissions After Termination of Agreement” was amended in November, 1988

      evidence was that the memo meant if he agreed to the 88-A, his commissions
      would vest and he would receive 5% commission on the premiums paid for  all
      renewal business of life insurance policies from 1967 forward. Manulife,
      on the other hand, argued at trial that any vested commissions applied
      only to renewals from 1991, when the 88-A was offered, until 1995, when
      a further agreement was entered into.  In addition, Manulife submitted
      that there was a distinction between the vested renewals referred to in
      the memo and the renewals which Ward was claiming.  No one was called by
      Manulife to explain the distinction. </span></p>

      Ward Inc. did not sign an actual contract at that time, the trial judge
      accepted Ward’s evidence that he concluded he did not need to do so.  The
      trial judge found support for his conclusion in an internal NAL memo dated
      April 30, 1991 which confirmed an agreement to “Provide the vesting of
      his (Ward’s) renewals through the 84AC and assign renewals to his corporation.”  An
      NAL official wrote on the memo “treat as Special 88A Member”.  Ward began
      to receive commissions on policies that were renewed from 1967 onward. </span></p>

      were vested from 1967 onward.  He found that Ward gave up the more lucrative

      year period in exchange for the lesser 5% commission that vested.  </span></p>

      1991 agreement was terminated in 1995, and Ward was asked to sign another
      88A contract by his then manager, John Martin.  This contract was silent
      as to whether commissions were vested, stating that they would be paid
      pursuant to the “Rules of the Company”.  Ward’s evidence was that prior
      to executing the 1995 agreement, he understood that the commission-vesting
      provisions contained in his 1991 agreement would continue to apply although
      that agreement was terminated.  Manulife called no witness from the relevant
      time to contradict him.  The trial judge accepted Ward’s evidence.  He
      stated at para. 47 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>On examination for discovery, NAL’s representative agreed that the
      vesting arrangement meant that the insurer would continue to pay commissions
      to the agent even after the agreement had been terminated provided the
      policyholders continued to pay premiums, the agent was licenced to sell
      life insurance, and there were no contractual provisions to the contrary.  </span></p>

      others on November 30, 1995, announcing the forthcoming merger and terminating
      its agency agreement with Ward Inc. Among other things, the letter said, “[p]rovided
      that a Manulife agreement is signed and returned to the Company by January
      15, 1996, holders of non-vested NAL Agreements will continue to receive
      their renewal commissions as long as their Manulife Agreement remains in

      December 29, 1995, having accepted assurances from Farley, Manulife’s Cobourg
      Manager, that he would be
    “grandfathered” under his new Manulife Producer’s Agreement, Ward caused
    Ward Inc. to enter into a non-exclusive Producer’s Agreement with Manulife.  The
    trial judge observed that on discovery, an NAL agent agreed that, “…the subsequent
    Producer’s Agreement with Manulife provided for the payment by Manulife of
    any commissions that were required to be made in the agreement between the
    agent and NAL.” </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The evidence persuades me that there should be a finding in favour
      of the Plaintiffs that the commissions on renewals were vested and that
      the start date is 1967 rather than 1991 as argued by Manulife.  I can find
      no compelling reason why I should find that the right to receive renewal
      commissions existed only during the life of the 1995 88-A contract.  As

      the fact that he gave up a more lucrative bonus structure; the April 30,

      It had nothing to do with the payment of vested commissions.  As mentioned
      by the trial judge at para. 189 of his reasons, there were collateral representations “…and
      collateral agreements concerning the vesting of commissions which induced
      the Plaintiffs to enter into the [Producer’s] agreement.”  He further held,
      at para. 196 of his reasons, that Ward’s right to receive lifetime renewals,
      subject to sufficient levels of “persistency” (a measure of the renewal
      rate of policies), was in the nature of a pension and not conditional on
      a continuation of the Producer’s agreement.</span></p>

      also knew or should have known that Ward was dependent on Manulife for

      of the Producer’s Agreement had nothing to do with the NAL vested commissions.  Ward
      relies on the NAL November 1995 memo which stated, “The Holders of vested
      NAL Agreements will, of course, continue to receive their renewals.”  Ward
      submits that the word “vested” means the right to renewal commissions exists
      irrespective of any contract and does not end when the contract is terminated.  Manulife’s
      only involvement with these vested premiums is as the collector and remitter

      insurer.  At a certain point, according to the insurer’s projections, the
      dividends earned on the policy, together with the premiums paid, created
      a pool of funds that would allow all future premiums to be paid out of
      the pool.  Thus the premiums would vanish in that no further out-of-pocket

      economy took place and interest rates fell in the early to mid-1990s, the

    it is apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that he was simply quoting
    an allegation made by Manulife to then say that this allegation had not been
