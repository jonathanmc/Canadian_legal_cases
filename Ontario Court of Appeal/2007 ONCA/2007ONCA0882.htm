    several occasions over the last few years, this court has been asked to deal
    with the vicarious liability provisions of s. 192 of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;H.8.  Section 192(2) makes the owner of a motor
    vehicle liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence
    in the operation of the vehicle “unless the motor vehicle … was without the
    owner’s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or
    the owner’s chauffeur.”  The application of this provision has arisen in
    a number of different circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the owner, a rental agency, alleged that the operator effectively
    stole the vehicle from the person who had consent to possess it, despite
    the fact that the person with consent to possess it was physically in the
    vehicle at the time of the accident.  Therefore, the owner argued that the
    exclusion in s. 192(2) applied and it was not liable for the damages caused
    by the operator’s negligence.  The owner applied for summary judgment on
    that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge not only dismissed the owner’s application for summary judgment,
    but found as a fact that the vehicle was in the possession of the operator
    with the owner’s consent and that the owner was therefore liable.  For the
    reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the declaration
    that the vehicle was in possession with the owner’s consent and dismiss the
    motion for summary judgment.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts of this case were set out in the affidavits and exhibits filed in support
    of the appellant’s motion for summary judgment, and were not objected to
    by any of the parties.  The plaintiff (respondent in this appeal), Peter
    Henwood, sells frozen meat door-to-door.  His supplier of meat products was
    owned by George Fitzgerald.  On June 30, 2000, Fitzgerald rented a truck
    from the defendant (appellant in this appeal), Ontario Car and Truck Rentals,
    on behalf of Henwood after Henwood’s truck broke down.  The rental agreement
    shows Fitzgerald as the renter and Henwood as the listed driver.  Fitzgerald
    asked Henwood to train the defendant (respondent in this appeal) Frederick
    Coburn by taking Coburn along on his sales trip.  Coburn did not have a driver’s
    licence and did not have car insurance.  In his examination for discovery,
    Henwood recalled that Fitzgerald told him that only he was to drive the truck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the day’s work was completed, Henwood and Coburn went to a tavern near Henwood’s
    home.  According to Henwood, Coburn began drinking and became belligerent.  Coburn
    wanted Henwood to take him to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie, several hours from the tavern and Henwood’s home.  Henwood refused,
    at which point Coburn punched him in the face and took the keys to the truck.  According
    to Henwood, Coburn got into the truck and began to drive away.  Henwood was
    able to get into the passenger side as the truck began moving.  During examination
    for discovery, Henwood said that he “jumped in the passenger side to talk
    him [Coburn] out of going [to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie].”  He said that there was still $5,000 worth of meat in the back
    of the truck, and he agreed that this was part of the reason he wanted to
    get into the truck.  He said that Coburn was drunk and that he repeatedly
    told him to stop and to slow down, but Coburn wasn’t listening.  Henwood
    had also been drinking, but he had been planning to leave the truck in the
    tavern’s parking lot and walk home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    twenty minutes into the drive, Coburn was unable to navigate a turn and the
    vehicle left the road and crashed into a field.  Henwood was injured in the
    accident, and sought damages from Coburn, Ontario Car, and his insurer, Pembridge
    Insurance Company, under his uninsured motorist coverage.  The Minister of
    Finance defends the action in the name of Coburn seeking to prevent any claim
    being paid out of the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    Car and Pembridge brought motions for summary judgment prior to trial.  Ontario
    Car’s motion was brought on the basis that the exclusion in s. 192(2) applied,
    so it was not liable for the damages caused by Coburn’s negligence.  Pembridge’s
    motion was based on an unrelated issue.  It was adjourned for reasons that
    are not material to this appeal and is not before this court.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    carefully reviewing many of the decisions that have interpreted s. 192, the
    motion judge concluded that those cases “stand for the principle that where
    the permitted driver remains an occupant in the vehicle and either specifically
    allows the non-permitted driver to drive the car or acquiesces to the driver
    using the car, the permitted driver continues to remain <i>in possession</i> of
    the vehicle, and the owner will remain liable” [emphasis in original].  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge stated that he was being “requested to make findings of fact
    and make a ruling in favour of Henwood.”  He found as a fact that the reason
    Henwood entered the vehicle was because he was “asserting his continued right
    to possession of it.” He interpreted the evidence before him as showing that
    Henwood was giving directions to Coburn and that he “continued to assert
    possession of the vehicle notwithstanding that he had a disagreement with
    Coburn about their destination.” Accordingly, he found that although Coburn
    was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident, Henwood was in possession
    of the vehicle. Since there was no question that Henwood was in possession
    with the consent of the owner, Ontario Car was liable under s. 192. The motion
    judge therefore granted judgment in favour of Henwood against Ontario Car.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Ontario Car, submits that on the undisputed evidence, Coburn was
    in possession of the vehicle without Henwood’s consent.  Therefore, the exclusion
    in s. 192(2) applies and summary judgment should have been granted in its
    favour. Alternatively, it submits that there are genuine issues for trial
    and it was not open to the motion judge to make a finding of fact that it
    is liable. Accordingly, it asks that the order of the motion judge be set
    aside and the issue of vicarious liability be sent on for trial.</p>

    appellant submits that the evidence demonstrates without question that Coburn
    was not in possession with the owner’s consent and this fact determines the
    s.&nbsp;192(2) issue in its favour, entitling it to summary judgment.  In
    my view, this argument cannot succeed.  It is inconsistent with the reasons
    of the majority in <i>Thompson v. Bourchier</i>, [1933] O.R. 525 (C.A.),
    which have repeatedly been followed by this court, the Divisional Court and
    trial courts for over eighty years. I can see no basis for not following
    or applying that decision in this case.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was held in <i>Thompson</i> that an owner will be liable under s. 192(2)
    where the person to whom the owner entrusted possession of the vehicle is
    in possession of the vehicle at the time of the collision, even if that person
    was not actually driving at the time.  </p>

    applying <i>Thompson </i>have made it clear that the fact that the driver
    may be operating the vehicle without the consent of the owner, or even contrary
    to the express wishes of the owner, is irrelevant provided that the person
    to whom the owner entrusted the vehicle is in possession of the vehicle,
    albeit as a passenger.  Some of these cases include:</p>

      son to use the car on condition that only he drove it.  The son allowed
      his friend to drive while he remained as a passenger.  Since the son remained
      in possession with the consent of the owner, the owner was liable.</p>

    ):  The owner lent the car to a friend who in turn allowed another person
    to drive.  The friend was a passenger at the time of the collision.  Since
    the friend was in possession with the consent of the owner at the time, the
    owner was liable.</p>

    ).  In that case, the owner leased the vehicle to Simon and Jefferies on
    condition that Simon not operate it because he was not licensed.  Simon was
    driving at the time of the accident.  However, since the owner had consented
    to Simon’s possession, it was liable even though it did not consent to his
    driving.  This court reiterated the point that the issue under s. 192 is
    possession, not operation.  Provided that the vehicle is in the possession
    of a person with the owner’s consent, the owner is liable regardless of whether
    the person actually operating the vehicle has the owner’s consent, and even
    if that person is operating the vehicle contrary to the owner’s express wishes.</p>

    appellant urges this court to follow the dissenting reasons of Masten J.A

    have held that the person actually operating the vehicle is the only person
    in possession (barring a chauffeur situation).  Whatever the logic of that
    position, it is now far too late to abandon over eighty years of settled

    consistent with the <i>Thompson</i> line of cases.  In <i>Thorne</i>, the
    owner gave Thorne possession of the car.  Thorne was with one MacNeil, who
    did not have a license.  Thorne expressly told MacNeil that he could not
    drive the car.  After drinking at a tavern, Thorne went to sleep in the vehicle,
    leaving the keys beside him.  He awoke to find that MacNeil was driving and
    heard him shout a warning just before the accident.  The court held that
    although Thorne had been in possession with the owner’s consent earlier in
    the evening, he was not in possession at the time MacNeil was driving. Although
    Thorne was physically in the car, he was asleep and therefore could not be
    said to be in possession.  Since MacNeil had obtained possession and control
    of the vehicle from Thorne without the consent of either Thorne or the owner,
    the owner was not liable.  </p>

    thus consistent with the <i>Thompson</i> line of cases because although the
    person in possession with the consent of the owner was physically present
    in the vehicle, he was not actually in possession of the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    summarize, the mere fact that someone, here Coburn, is operating the vehicle
    without the owner’s consent is not determinative of the owner’s liability
    under s. 192. If someone, such as Henwood in this case, is found to be in
    possession, and that person has the owner’s consent, the owner will be liable
    even if the person in possession is only a passenger. Accordingly, the appellant
    was not entitled to summary judgment in its favour.</p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in my view, Henwood was not entitled to summary judgment. Even though Henwood
    was physically in the car, that undisputed fact did not determine that he
    was in possession of the vehicle. While cases where the person who has the
    owner’s consent to possess the vehicle is not in possession although physically
    present may be rare, they do exist. <i>Thorne</i> is one example.  There
    are others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    example, in <i>DiFede v. McCarthy</i> (1984), 27 M.V.R. 170 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Ont. Div. Ct.), the owner’s husband, who did not have a driver’s licence,
    grabbed the car keys without her consent. The owner jumped in the car as
    it began moving and yelled at him to stop driving.  The accident occurred
    a short time later.  The court held that at the time of the accident, the
    owner was not in possession; rather, she was attempting to gain possession.  Craig
    J. held at para. 8 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    the husband commenced to drive off without the owner’s consent and at that
    time, he had possession of the motor vehicle without consent of the owner;
    she never did regain possession in the true sense although she was attempting
    to do so, and she never did give consent to possession by her husband.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>In those
    circumstances, the owner, like the owner in <i>Thorne,</i> was not liable
    under s. 192(2).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case also bears some similarity to <i>Kuhmo and Laakso v. Helberg</i>, [1931]
    O.R. 630 (S.C. A.D.),<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> where the court found that the owner was not liable
    even though his chauffeur was physically in the vehicle.  The owner had leased
    the car to one
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moline on the condition that the owner’s chauffeur drove it.  During the
    journey,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Moline became drunk and insisted on driving.  He was able to wrest control
    of the vehicle from the chauffeur despite the chauffeur’s resistance.  As
    the court said at p. 633, “the change of operators was due to duress and
    brought about a situation distinctly contrary to the [owner's] express instructions
    and the bargain made with
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moline.”  The court reasoned that if fraud or force had been used to enable
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moline to “oust” the chauffeur, the owner would clearly not be liable.  The
    court saw no difference between the effect of duress and of fraud or force.</p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    cases demonstrate that it is open to dispute whether Henwood was in possession
    of the vehicle at the time of the collision. Whether or not Henwood was in
    possession in turn determines the appellant’s liability, regardless of the
    fact that Coburn was operating the vehicle without Henwood’s or the owner’s
    consent.  In my view, the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment
    in favour of Henwood when there were material facts in dispute.  The motion
    judge’s error is found in the following passage from para. 46 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The court finds
    that Henwood was in possession of the rented vehicle at the time of the accident
    within the meaning of s. 192 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> and Ontario
    Car is liable as owner of the vehicle.  The very reason that Henwood got
    into the passenger’s side of the vehicle was that he was asserting his continued
    right to possession of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Henwood
    may or may not have been asserting his right to possession, but that did
    not mean that he was necessarily in possession.  Asserting a right to possession
    and possession are not the same thing.  As Kellock J. said in <i>Marsh v.
    Kulchar</i>, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 330 at 335:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When a motor
    car is stolen from the owner, the thief takes actual physical possession,
    and thus takes it out of the possession of the owner, although the right
    to possession remains with the latter.<a href="#_ftn3"

line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is a question of fact whether Henwood had regained possession of the vehicle
    at the time of the accident.  As this court has said in a number of decisions,
    most recently in <i>Thorne</i> at para. 18, “the question of whether a motor
    vehicle was in the possession of some other person without the owner’s consent
    is a question of fact to be decided by the evidence in each particular case”.  <span lang=EN-US>I
    note that in <i>Finlayson</i> at para. 23, this court stated that, “Possession
    is a question of law whereas operation of a vehicle is a question of fact.”  I
    think it more correct to say that the meaning of possession is a question
    of law; the application of that definition to any particular set of facts
    is not a question of law alone.  There is no suggestion in <i>Finlayson</i> that
    the court intended to depart from the line of authority referred to in <i>Thorne</i> holding
    that whether a person is in possession of a vehicle depends on the particular
    facts.</span>  </p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    of the evidence showing that there was a genuine issue for trial on the question
    of Henwood’s possession includes the following, tending to weigh against
    Henwood having possession:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Henwood, Coburn began drinking and became belligerent and when Henwood
    refused to drive Coburn to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Barrie, Coburn punched him in the face and took the keys.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Henwood

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    one of his statements, Henwood stated that
    “[t]here is no way Fred Coburn could have got the impression he had my consent
    to drive that truck.  He had never driven it in the past and he forcibly
    took the keys from me.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    purporting to find that Henwood was in possession, the motion judge exceeded
    his role under Rule 20 by granting summary judgment when there were material
    facts in dispute.  In my view, it is no answer to say that Henwood invited
    the motion judge to make findings of fact.  There is no suggestion that the
    appellant agreed to the motion judge adopting that role and counsel for the
    appellant denied before us that his client took any such position before
    the motion judge.  </p>

    I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the motion judge holding
    that Henwood was in possession within the meaning of s. 192 and that the
    appellant is liable as owner of the vehicle. I would dismiss the appellant’s
    motion for summary judgment and remit this matter to trial.  The appellant
    is entitled to its costs of the appeal fixed at $9,000, inclusive of G.S.T.
    and disbursements, payable jointly and severally by the respondents Henwood
    and the Minister.  </p>

    costs of the motion before the motion judge are another matter.  The motion
    judge should not have granted summary judgment in favour of Henwood, but
    the appellant was not entitled to summary judgment since there was a genuine
    issue for trial.  In my view, the Minister and Henwood are entitled to their
    costs of the motion payable by the appellant, which I would fix at $4,000
    each, inclusive of G.S.T and disbursements.  As I understand it, Pembridge
    is not seeking costs on the appeal, nor is any party seeking costs from Pembridge.  I
    also understand that this court need not deal with Pembridge’s costs before
    the motion judge.  If I am wrong in these assumptions, Pembridge may make
    brief written submissions on costs within five days of release of these reasons
    and any party opposed to its position may respond within five days of receiving
    Pembridge’s submissions.</p>
