style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal.  It argues that the trial judge
    erred: (i) by accepting the respondent’s causation expert as a person qualified
    to give opinion evidence in this case; (ii) in his apportionment of liability;
    and (iii) by allegedly failing to exercise his discretion independently to
    determine whether the appellant’s adjournment request on the first day of
    trial should have been granted.  We reject these grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complaints raised by the appellant concerning the respondent’s causation
    expert bear on the weight to be assigned to, rather than the admissibility
    of, his evidence:  see <i>McLean (Litigation Guardian of) v. Seisel</i> (2004),
    182 O.A.C. 122 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) per Gillese J.A. at paras. 108-09.  In this case, the witness had experience
    in numerous cases in the investigation of the origin and cause of fires.  Despite
    his lack of formal accreditation at the time of his investigation of this
    fire, his practical experience was sufficient to render his opinion evidence
    admissible.  It was open to the appellant to then attack –
    as it did – the weight to be attached to the witness’ evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s admissibility ruling makes it abundantly clear that he
    was alert to the alleged deficiencies in the witness’ expertise, experience
    and qualifications, and that he was mindful of his obligation to take such
    alleged deficiencies into account when ultimately assessing the weight, if
    any, to be assigned to the witness’ testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s challenge to the trial judge’s apportionment of liability also
    fails.  We agree with the respondent’s submission that there is no basis
    in fact or law to interfere with the trial judge’s decision concerning contributory
    negligence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the fire was caused by the defendant’s negligent business
    operations.  He also found that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent
    by failing to have sufficient plans in place to respond to a fire emergency
    of the kind at issue and by failing to take appropriate steps to deal with
    the fire when it occurred.  On those facts, the trial judge’s apportionment
    of liability adequately addressed the relative degrees of the blameworthiness
    of the parties.  We are not persuaded that the high test for intervention
    with that apportionment has been met.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s treatment of the appellant’s request
    at trial for an adjournment.  The history of this matter as outlined for
    the trial judge included numerous earlier adjournments requested and obtained
    by the appellant and a denial by the Regional Senior Justice of an adjournment
    request by the appellant a mere ten days prior to the scheduled commencement
    date of the trial.  On our reading of the trial judge’s adjournment ruling,
    he simply declined to exercise his discretion to grant an adjournment at
    trial – as he was entitled to do – in light of this history.  We note that
    the same ground for the adjournment request – the unavailability of the appellant’s
    preferred trial counsel – was presented to the trial judge as had been advanced
    before the Regional Senior Justice ten days earlier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, we see no error in the trial judge’s discretionary decision to
    refuse the appellant’s renewed adjournment request.  To the contrary, we
    agree with his decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant asserts that the trial scheduling system in use in the Region where
    this trial took place is regularly depriving litigants of their choice of
    trial counsel.  There is no evidence before us to support this submission.  More
    importantly, however, this appellant received several indulgences from the
    court in the form of serial adjournments
    – some of which were opposed – to accommodate its choice of trial counsel.  This,
    of course, occasioned costs and inconvenience both to the respondent and
    its counsel.  In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the denial of
    the appellant’s final adjournment request worked any unfairness on the appellant,
    which was thereafter represented at trial by experienced counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the
    appeal, fixed in the total amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
