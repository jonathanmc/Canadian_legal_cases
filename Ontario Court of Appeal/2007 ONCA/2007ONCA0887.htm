    appellant appeals from his convictions by a court composed of McNeely J.
    and a jury for sexual assault, sexual interference and forcible confinement.  The
    appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal relating to the charge to
    the jury.  For the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the complainant lived on different floors of the same apartment
    building.  At the time of the offences, the complainant was thirteen years
    of age and living with her parents and siblings.  The appellant was twenty
    years of age and living with his girlfriend and her children.  There had
    been some previous contact between the complainant and the appellant.  It
    was the theory of the defence that the complainant had a “crush” on the appellant.  The
    complainant testified that on the day of the offences, the appellant pulled
    her into his apartment while she was walking by his door.  He then forcibly
    removed her clothes and had unprotected sexual intercourse with her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that the complainant entered the apartment voluntarily
    and consented to sexual intercourse.  The theory of the defence was that
    the complainant later told her mother and others that she had been raped
    when she was confronted about her loss of virginity.  The appellant also
    testified that he believed that the complainant was seventeen years of age
    because she had told him this and from other circumstances.  The complainant
    denied telling the appellant that she was seventeen and testified that she
    lied to him telling him that she was eleven.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Theory of the Defence </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal ground of appeal, and the only ground we called upon
    the Crown to respond to, is that the trial judge failed to adequately set
    out the theory of the defence and the evidence in support of the defence
    of consent in his charge to the jury.  While consent is not generally a defence
    to charges of sexual assault and sexual interference involving complainants
    under fourteen years of age, consent could have been a defence in this case
    if the jury also had a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that
    the complainant was fourteen years of age or more, in accordance with the
    requirements set out in s.&nbsp;150.1(4) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the theory of the defence was adequately set out by the trial judge.  In
    reviewing the defence position, he briefly reviewed the appellant’s evidence
    that the complainant sought him out and had been flirting with him.  The
    trial judge also referred the jury to the appellant’s evidence as to the
    previous contact between him and the complainant.  The jury would clearly
    understand that the defence position was that the complainant consented to
    the sexual encounter.  It was also the defence position that the complainant
    eventually claimed that she had been raped because of pressure from her mother
    and others once it became known that she had lost her virginity.  While the
    trial judge did not review the evidence as to what happened after the encounter
    when setting out the defence position, he had reviewed that evidence as part
    of his review of all of the evidence in the case only minutes earlier in
    the charge.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would no doubt have been preferable if the trial judge had made more explicit
    reference to the defence theory about the impact of the events after the
    encounter in reviewing the position of the defence.  However, the jury had
    just heard defence counsel describe that part of the defence theory and,
    as we have said, that evidence was reviewed in the charge.  In these circumstances,
    we are satisfied that the jury would have appreciated the theory of the defence
    and the evidence in support of that defence.  Finally, we take into account
    that there was no objection from defence counsel at trial to this aspect
    of the charge.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Inconsistencies
      in the Complainant’s Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were some inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence, particularly as
    to the details of her prior contact with the appellant, how she entered the
    apartment and whether she heard people on the balcony.  The appellant submits
    that the trial judge did not adequately review these inconsistencies in his
    charge to the jury.  There is no obligation on a trial judge to review all
    of the inconsistencies in a witness’s evidence.  The trial judge reviewed
    the substance of the complainant’s evidence.  In any event,  most of these
    inconsistencies were relatively minor.  There was also no objection from
    defence counsel to this aspect of the charge.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Confirmatory
      Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the general part of the charge to the jury on assessing the credibility of
    witnesses, the trial judge pointed out that they should consider whether
    the physical evidence tended to support one version of events or another.  He
    then referred to the evidence of the nurse and to evidence from the Centre
    of Forensic Sciences that sperm was found in the swab taken from the complainant,
    indicating that the appellant had unprotected intercourse with her.  The
    appellant submits that this evidence was not supportive of the complainant’s
    version of events because it was conceded that the appellant had intercourse
    with the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion, the trial judge’s reference to the evidence of the nurse as
    a whole was clearly supportive of the complainant’s version of events because
    it was also the nurse’s evidence that the complainant had injuries in the
    vaginal area and was still bleeding a day after the encounter with the appellant.  This
    was consistent with the complainant’s testimony that the appellant had engaged
    in forced and painful sexual intercourse with her when she resisted.  Even
    if the fact that the appellant had unprotected sexual intercourse offered
    no support for the complainant’s story, this was of little moment given the
    significant probative value of the nurse’s evidence as a whole.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Withdrawal
      of Consent</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s evidence was that she protested against the appellant’s advances
    from the beginning of the encounter when he first pulled her into the apartment.  For
    his part, the appellant described a fully consensual encounter throughout.  However,
    in response to an objection from Crown counsel, the trial judge instructed
    the jury in accordance with s. 273.1(2)(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that
    even if the complainant originally consented, no consent is obtained where
    the complainant expresses by words or conduct a lack of agreement to continue
    to engage in the activity.  Defence counsel at trial raised no objection
    to the trial judge recharging the jury in this respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not err in charging the jury in accordance
    with s.&nbsp;273.1(2)(e).  The jury was not required to accept all of the
    complainant’s evidence.  It was open to the jury to find that the original
    encounter was consensual because of the evidence about the complainant’s
    interest in the appellant.  But it was also open to the jury to find that
    the complainant clearly withdrew her consent when the encounter became painful.  If
    the jury took that view of the evidence, it was important that they understood
    the legal implications of the complainant’s change of mind.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Out-of-Court Statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the general part of the charge, the trial judge gave the jury a direction
    concerning the use of hearsay evidence, although he did not use that term.  In
    short, he instructed the jury that aside from out-of-court statements by
    the appellant and the complainant’s videotaped statement, out-of-court statements
    were not evidence unless the witness adopted them.  He also pointed out that
    unadopted inconsistent statements could be considered in assessing the evidence
    of witnesses at trial.  The appellant submits that these instructions were
    misleading in this case because statements made by the complainant’s mother
    and her neighbours after the encounter were relevant to the complainant’s
    state of mind.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that this general direction would not have misled the jury.  When
    he later reviewed the testimony of the complainant’s mother and neighbours,
    the trial judge referred to it as “evidence”.  He did not direct the jury
    that this testimony could not be used as evidence and told the jury to consider
    whether what happened after the incident was more consistent with the complainant’s
    version of events or the appellant’s version.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Defence
      of Mistake</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge did not fairly present the defence
    of mistake as to age, and in particular, the objective element of that defence.  We
    do not agree.  In the charge and in the recharge, the trial judge instructed
    the jury that the reasonableness of the steps taken by the appellant to ascertain
    the complainant’s age would depend on the appearance of the complainant and
    the accused’s knowledge of the complainant and her associates. These were
    all factors that were relied upon by the appellant.  The trial judge also
    made it clear that there was no particular step that had to be taken and
    that an accused does not have to take all possible steps in order to have
    acted reasonably.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Reasonable
      Doubt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to give the jury
    the reasonable doubt instruction from <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C.
    (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  However, the classic <i>W.&nbsp;(D.)</i> instruction
    would not have been accurate in this case.  In view of the objective element
    to the s. 150.1(4) defence, even if the jury accepted the appellant’s testimony,
    the appellant was not automatically entitled to an acquittal on the charges
    of sexual assault and sexual interference.  It was only if the jury also
    had a reasonable doubt that the appellant had taken all reasonable steps
    to ascertain the complainant’s age that he was entitled to be acquitted.  Thus,
    the trial judge charged the jury on several occasions that the burden was
    on the Crown to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt and that this burden
    also applied to the defence of mistake.  In the circumstances, we think that
    this was sufficient and that the jury would have understood the application
    of reasonable doubt in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge could have provided the classic <i>W. (D.)</i> charge in
    relation to the forcible confinement charge, it was a judgment call for the
    trial judge as to whether this direction was necessary or would have been
    confusing in the circumstances.  We note that in response to an objection
    by defence counsel, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that
    the Crown had to prove all elements of forcible confinement, including lack
    of consent, beyond a reasonable doubt.  We are satisfied that the instructions
    were adequate.</p>
