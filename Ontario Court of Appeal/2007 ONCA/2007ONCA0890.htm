  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a hearing in March 2006, the Consent and Capacity Board (the “Board”) made
    three orders against the appellant, Daniela Giecewicz:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    Board confirmed her status as an involuntary patient under the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7;</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    Board found, pursuant to s. 32(1) of the <i>Health Care Consent Act</i>,
    S.O. 1996, c. 2, Sch. A, that the appellant was incapable with respect to
    treatment with
    “anti-psychotic and side effects medications”;  and</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    Board found, pursuant to s. 60(1) of the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, that the
    appellant was not capable of managing her property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appealed all three orders to the Superior Court of Justice.  The
    appeal was heard in July 2006, dismissed in January 2007 with reasons provided
    in February 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant further appeals to this court from the orders declaring her incapable
    with respect to treatment and the management of her property.  The appellant
    does not challenge the order confirming her status as an involuntary patient.  She
    remains an involuntary patient.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board found, based on the evidence of Dr. Hastings, that the appellant suffered
    from a mental disorder he described as
    “chronic persecutory delusions”.  The Board further held that because of
    this disorder, the appellant could not either leave or fix her dilapidated
    home.  Consequently, the Board found that it was likely she would suffer
    serious physical impairment by continuing to live in a squalid and unsafe
    environment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board further found that while the appellant could understand the information
    given to her by Dr. Hastings that was relevant to her treatment decisions,
    she could not apply that information to her own situation because of the
    delusional disorder that she denied and that rendered her incapable of appreciating
    the benefits of taking the recommended medication or the risks of refusing
    to take that medication.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board also held that the appellant’s delusional system made her incapable
    of managing her property.  The Board specifically noted that it was not concerned
    with the wisdom of the appellant’s decisions, but with her capacity to make
    those decisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Superior Court Justice dismissed the appeal from the Board’s orders.  He
    found that the Board had applied the proper legal test in determining the
    appellant’s capacity to consent to treatment and manage her affairs.  He
    applied a standard of reasonableness to the Board’s application of the legal
    tests to the facts and concluded that on the evidence before the Board, its
    decision was reasonable.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    argument, there was some reference to alleged errors made on the appeal to
    the Superior Court.  The focus was, however, on the Board’s decision.  The
    Board’s orders raise two issues:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>did
    the Board apply the correct legal tests in arriving at its conclusions?</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>are
    the Board’s decisions with respect to incapacity as it relates to treatment
    and management of financial affairs reasonable?</p>
  <h2>(a)  Did the Board apply the correct legal tests?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Starson
      v. Swaze</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 722 at para. 78, Major J., writing for the
      majority, explained the test for capacity found in s. 4(1) of the <i>Health
      Care Consent Act</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Capacity involves
    two criteria.&nbsp; <u>First, a person must be able to understand the information
    that is relevant to making a treatment decision.</u>&nbsp; This requires
    the cognitive ability to process, retain and understand the relevant information. …&nbsp; <u>Second,
    a person must be able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences
    of the decision or lack of one.</u>&nbsp;
    This requires the patient to be able to apply the relevant information to
    his or her circumstances, and to be able to weigh the foreseeable risks and
    benefits of a decision or lack thereof.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    review of the Board’s reasons satisfies me that that the Board applied the
    proper tests in concluding that the appellant was not capable to make decisions
    about treatment with “anti-psychotic and side effects medication” and was
    incapable of managing her own property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the evidence, the position of the parties and properly describing
    the onus of proof, the Board accurately summarized the relevant statutory
    provisions.  The Board then concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The doctor
      said that the Applicant can understand the information that is relevant
      to making a decision about treatment.  However, she does not seem to apply
      it to herself. She has a delusional disorder which she denies.  She said
      she does not need treatment.  She does not appreciate the benefits of taking
      medication or the risks of not taking it.</u>  Therefore she is not able
      to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or
      lack of decision about treatment.  Hence she is not capable regarding treatment.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Her underlying
    delusional system makes the Applicant not capable of managing her property.  Her
    persecutory delusions have meant her spending a great deal of money in legal
    fees over the years with respect to her land and her neighbours.  <u>The
    Board is not commenting on the wisdom or lack of wisdom of those expenses.  The
    Board is concerned with capacity not wisdom.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Were
    the Board’s decisions reasonable?</h2>
  <h2>(i)  The standard of review</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board’s application of the proper legal standard to the evidence before the
    Board is reviewable on a reasonableness standard:  <i>Starson v. Swaze</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 84.  The reasonableness inquiry dictates respect for the expertise
    and advantaged position of the Board.  It also, however, demands a somewhat
    probing examination of the reasons offered by the Board for its conclusion.  That
    examination must ensure that the reasons taken as a whole provide a line
    of analysis, supported by the evidence, that can reasonably justify the Board’s
    conclusion:  <i>Law Society of
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <h2>(ii)  The statutory provisions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasonableness inquiry begins with the applicable legal standards for capacity
    to consent to treatment and manage one’s own affairs.  The relevant statutory
    provisions are set out below:</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>(1)</span><span
style='font-weight:normal;'> </span><span
style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>Health Care Consent Act, 1996</span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>,
      S.O. 1996, c. 2, Sch. A</span></h3>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Capacity</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.  (1)  A person
    is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a
    personal assistance service if the person is able to understand the information
    that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, admission or personal
    assistance service, as the case may be, and able to appreciate the reasonably
    foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.  </p>
  <p>(2) <i>Substitute Decisions Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 30</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Incapacity to manage property</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>6.  A person
    is incapable of managing property if the person is not able to understand
    information that is relevant to making a decision in the management of his
    or her property, or is not able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable
    consequences of a decision or lack of decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    capacity inquiries described in the two statutes are similar.  Both contain
    two criteria.  A person is incapable of making treatment decisions or managing
    his or her own property if that person cannot understand the information
    relevant to the making of the decision, or if that person is unable to appreciate
    the reasonably foreseeable consequences of making the decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was not suggested before the Board that the appellant was incapable of understanding
    the information relevant to treatment decisions or decisions pertaining to
    the management of her property.  To the contrary, Dr. Hastings described
    the appellant as an intelligent person who was fully capable of understanding
    the information she received from him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board did conclude, however, based on Dr. Hastings’ report and his evidence,
    that the appellant, because of her particular mental disorder, was incapable
    of appreciating the reasonably foreseeable consequences of decisions she
    was making with respect to her treatment and her financial affairs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    meaning of the ability to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences
    of a decision was considered in relation to s. 4 of the <i>Health Care Consent
    Act</i> by both the majority and the dissent in <i>Starson v. Swaze</i>, <i>supra</i>.  I
    see no difference of opinion between the two judgments on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Major
    J., for the majority, said at paras. 79, 81:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… While a patient
    need not agree with a particular diagnosis, if it is demonstrated he has
    a mental “condition”, <u>the patient must be able to recognize the possibility
    that he is affected by that condition.</u> …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a result,
    a patient is not required to describe his mental condition as an “illness”,
    or to otherwise characterize the condition in negative terms.  Nor is a patient
    required to agree with the attending physician’s opinion regarding the cause
    of that condition.  <u>Nonetheless, if the patient’s condition results in
    him being unable to recognize that he is affected by its manifestations,
    he will be unable to apply the relevant information to his circumstances,
    and unable to appreciate the consequences of his decision.</u> …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, a patient’s
    failure to demonstrate actual appreciation does not inexorably lead to a
    conclusion of incapacity.  The patient’s lack of appreciation may derive
    from causes that do not undermine his <u>ability</u> to appreciate consequences.  For
    instance, a lack of appreciation may reflect the attending physician’s failure
    to adequately inform the patient of the decision’s consequences [reference
    omitted].  Accordingly, it is imperative that the Board inquire into the
    reasons for the patient’s failure to appreciate consequences.  <u>A finding
    of incapacity is justified only if those reasons demonstrate that the patient’s
    mental disorder prevents him from having the ability to appreciate the foreseeable
    consequences of the decision.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Justice McLachlin, in dissent, observed at para. 17 that the ability to appreciate
    involved more than a mere understanding of the relevant information.  Appreciation
    required some ability to evaluate the information.  She then quoted with

    have identified three “common clinical indicators” of a person’s ability

    able to assess how the proposed treatment and alternatives, including no
    treatment, could affect his or her life or quality of life; <u>[whether]

    that she and her husband had purchased many years earlier.  Her husband was
    deceased.  Although the home was very large and was located on a valuable
    piece of property, it was in an extremely dilapidated state.  The basement
    was flooded, there was no hydro, and part of the ceiling in the bedroom had

    Hastings concluded that the appellant suffered from a disorder of persecutory
    delusions.  These problems stemmed from her longstanding legal disputes concerning
    access to her home by way of an easement over her neighbour’s land.  The
    legal dispute had developed into an obsession that affected all aspects of
    the appellant’s life.  She was convinced that she was being persecuted by
    her neighbours and various public authorities.  She believed that her lawyers
    and family physician may be involved in the persecution and that her closest
    living relative, a brother in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    , could not be forthcoming regarding these problems because of a “gag order” that
    prevented him from telling the truth.  The appellant was convinced that all
    of her problems stemmed from these legal difficulties and that none could
    be properly addressed until she received justice in respect of these legal
    problems.</p>

    Hastings described the appellant as intelligent and physically healthy.  She
    did not suffer from any form of dementia.  Dr. Hastings went on to describe
    the appellant’s delusional belief system:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The conviction
    to which she holds that is very, very strong, and this is the – the foundation
    of the delusional belief.  <u>She feels that were she to back out of this

    for instance, to live with her family, that it would just follow her there.  She’s

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The reason
      for that was that in my repeated discussions with her, she couldn’t focus

    appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of her decision to refuse
    the recommended medication:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… <u>Her judgment

      problems.  She’s very giving in that way, she wants to let these people
      that have made mistakes undo their wrongs, and make it right.  And she
      can’t see that that won’t happen, she can’t see that her behaviour is preventing
      that from happening, and that these judgments really are – are done, there’re

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>This same
      delusional system is the one that I believe also makes her incapable of
      consenting to treatment.  She does not believe that this is a mental disorder.</u>  While
      she is able to understand the information about what delusional disorder
      is, the kinds of medications that might be used for this disorder, the
      potential side effects of this medication, that’s not at issue.  The issue
      is her ability to appreciate the reasonably forseeable consequences of
      treatment or non-treatment. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>She fundamentally
      does not believe that she is ill, delusional.  She fundamentally does not

      come pass, should she not be treated for this condition.</u>  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of her ability to make decisions concerning property, Dr. Hastings
    said the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I believe she
    also currently continues to be incapable of managing property. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… she’s a smart
    woman, the issue again is the intrusion of this delusional system on her
    ability to make overall judgment about her financial situation.  She says
    she wants to repair her house, but she has not done it.  She says that she
    would like to go and be with her family, she has not sold her house.  She
    can’t, her system prevents her from entertaining that possibility.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… I think she
    would continue to run into problems as a result of this delusional system
    about having her electricity and hydro and Visa bills and interest on all

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>And because
      it again all goes back to the beginning problems, everything that flows
      from that is not really perceived as being important.  What needs to be

      the involvement of the City in terms of persecuting her, being in a democratic

    have set out the evidence in some detail because, in my view, that evidence
    speaks to the very situation described by both Major J. and McLachlin C.J.C.
    in the passages from their reasons in <i>Starson v. Swaze</i> quoted above.  According
    to Dr. Hastings, the appellant suffers from a mental disorder that in the
    words of Major J., quoted above at para. 17 makes her unable to apply the
    relevant information given to her to her own circumstances and unable to
    appreciate the consequence of her decisions.  Dr. Hastings testified that
    the appellant’s inability to acknowledge the existence of the condition for
    which he had recommended medication thoroughly undermined her ability to
    evaluate that information and his advice.  </p>

    Hastings’ evidence also reveals two of the three indicators of incapacity
    based on an inability to appreciate consequences referred to by McLachlin
    C.J.C. in the passage quoted above at para. 19.  Dr. Hastings opined that
    the appellant was unable to acknowledge the fact that the condition for which
    he recommended treatment may affect her (the first criterion described by
    McLachlin C.J.C.), and that her choice to refuse treatment was substantially
    based on her delusional belief system (the third criterion described by McLachlin

    cannot agree with the first submission outlined above.  Dr. Hastings did
    testify that he spoke to the appellant about possible adverse side effects.  According
    to him, she understood the information, but could not apply it to her situation
    because of her mental disorder.  This was not a case where it could be suggested
    that the appellant’s lack of appreciation of the risks and benefits reflected
    the “physician’s failure to adequately inform the patient of the decision’s

    it was required to make.  It is not the Board’s task to weigh the risks and
    benefits of the proposed treatment or to make any determination as to the
