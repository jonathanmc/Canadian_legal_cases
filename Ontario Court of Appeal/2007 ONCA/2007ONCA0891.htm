    appellant was charged with sexually assaulting his stepdaughter.  The trial
    judge, Cumming J., convicted him and imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment
    and three years’ probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction on two grounds: (1) the trial judge erred
    in considering the appellant’s demeanour; and (2) the trial judge erred by
    permitting Crown counsel to ask the appellant why the complainant would lie
    about the alleged assault.</p>
  <h3>(1)       <u>The demeanour issue</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge wrote comprehensive reasons for judgment.  He thoroughly reviewed
    the testimony of all the witnesses and dealt directly with many of the problems
    with the testimony of the complainant advanced by defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explicitly adopted the analytical framework set out in <i>R.
    v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  On the first branch of the <i>W. (D.)</i> analysis,
    the trial judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I observed his demeanour carefully in giving his
    evidence and throughout the trial.  Accused persons will react differently
    given the stress of a criminal trial.  A judge must be very careful in drawing
    inferences in respect of demeanour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T.E.] was not at all convincing in his denial
    of any guilt.  He made a blanket denial but his expression was completely
    passive.  It was as though he was embarrassed by what had taken place, had
    detached himself from the situation and resigned himself to accepting the
    consequences.  He made notes throughout the trial but seemed to avoid eye
    contact with the witnesses, including the complainant.  Considering all of
    the defendant’s evidence, I do not believe him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge’s references to the appellant’s apparent
    passivity and to his failure to make eye contact with the other witnesses
    at the trial constitute erroneous use of demeanour evidence.  We agree.  As
    the trial judge himself observed, accused persons can react differently in
    a stressful criminal trial.  Without explaining why, and without acknowledging
    the effect of cultural background on demeanour (the appellant was born and
    raised in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Sudan</st1:country-region>
    ), the trial judge equated passivity and an absence of eye contact with witnesses
    with rejection of the appellant’s credibility and, ultimately, his testimonial
    denial of committing the offence.  This equation is, in our view, a misconceived
    and improper linkage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown does not attempt to uphold the accuracy or merit of the trial judge’s
    two observations about the appellant’s demeanour.  Rather, the Crown contends
    that the trial judge relied on other evidence in rejecting the appellant’s
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his analysis under the first branch of <i>W. (D.)</i>, the trial judge did
    comment critically on other aspects of the appellant’s testimony.  Immediately
    after commenting on the appellant’s demeanour, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As for [T.E.], he stated that he could have been
    at home at the time of the alleged offence; but said he also could have been
    at work.  The onus is not upon [T.E.], of course, to prove his innocence.  However,
    one would think there would be a record of his shift work schedule from his
    employer such that he could have established he could not have been at home
    at 10:00 a.m. on August 19, 1999 such that there was not even the opportunity
    of committing the offence.  His insistence that he did not even have the
    opportunity to commit the alleged rape was not convincing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that in this passage the trial judge is dealing with a point different
    from the appellant’s demeanour.  However, the problem with the passage is
    that the first and last sentences are inconsistent.  The observation that “he
    could have been at home at the time of the alleged offence” does not support
    the trial judge’s ultimate conclusion that “[h]is insistence that he did
    not even have the opportunity to commit the alleged rape was not convincing.”  Indeed,
    on our reading of the appellant’s testimony, the first observation precisely
    reflects what the appellant said.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt comprehensively with the third branch of <i>W. (D.)</i>.  He
    was satisfied that the Crown evidence, especially the complainant’s testimony,
    supported a conviction.  In our view, there is nothing to criticize in this
    component of his analysis.  However, the fact remains that his reasons for
    rejecting the appellant’s testimony are legally flawed.  Accordingly, we
    would give effect to the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>(2)       <u>The cross-examination issue</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that the trial judge should not have permitted Crown
    counsel to ask the appellant to comment on whether the complainant had a
    motive to lie: see <i>R. v. Rose</i> (2001), 153 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  However, in the circumstances of this case, we do not think that this
    error had any effect on the trial for two reasons: first, this was a judge-alone
    trial and the trial judge did not rely on the appellant’s response in any
    way; and second, the appellant’s answer – “I don’t know” – was innocuous
    and non-prejudicial.  Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h3><u>Disposition</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first error vitiates the conviction of the appellant.  Accordingly, the appeal
    is allowed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
