  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            <u>The Appeal</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    liquidator of Standard Trust Company (“Standard”) brought action against
    Metropolitan Trust Company of Canada and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
    (collectively, “Met”) for damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,
    breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The claims arose as the result
    of certain mortgage advances made by Met on behalf of Standard to Darrow
    Development Limited (“Darrow”) in relation to a waterfront condominium development
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brockville,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    all times, the relationship between Standard and Met was governed by a Mortgage
    Administration Agreement (“MAA”) entered into in 1972 between Standard as
    the investor and Met as the trust company. Although the trial judge found
    that Standard and Met are both sophisticated and knowledgeable mortgage investors
    actively involved in the mortgage lending market, on this transaction Met
    acted on behalf of Standard. Met held Standard’s interest in trust and contracted
    to exercise the care and prudence it would exercise if the mortgage were
    held for its own account and as would be exercised by a prudent mortgagee.
    The agreement effectively gave Met a “<i>carte blanche</i>” in terms of the
    mortgage dealings on behalf of Standard once Standard agreed to commit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mortgage went into default in April 1988 when thirty-four liens were registered
    against the property. Ultimately and at the urging of Standard, the lien
    trustee issued an order vesting title in 772792 Ontario Ltd. (“772792”),
    a company controlled by Richard Wachter (“Wachter”), a customer of Standard
    in a number of other unrelated transactions. Wachter also defaulted in January
    1990.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Met responsible for the losses suffered by Standard up
    to November 1988, when the loan was taken over by the Wachter interest. He
    assessed those losses at $203,000 and awarded judgment against Met in favour
    of Standard in that amount plus interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claims entitlement to the full amount of the mortgage advances
    to Darrow to the point of its default in the total sum of $2,743,372.70 plus
    interest.</p>
  <h3><u>The Cross-Appeal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent claims that when Standard agreed to replace Darrow with Wachter
    it agreed to the substitution of one debtor for another which, in law, amounts
    to novation. Therefore, it is Met’s position that Standard has no losses
    to the date of that substitution and, in view of Standard having admitted
    that any losses suffered thereafter are too remote to be the subject of claims
    against Met, this action ought to have been dismissed.</p>
  <h3><u>The Facts</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 1987, Mr. Simpson of Met received the mortgage proposal from a broker,
    Coulter Financial Services Ltd., and used it to prepare his own proposal.
    He included a representation that there was $1.5 million invested and pre-sales
    of approximately fifty per cent of the residential units. He sent the proposal
    to several prospective lenders, including Standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 6, 1987, well before Standard approved the loan, Mr. Gibson, a Vice-President
    of Met, received a phone call from a local
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brockville developer well-known to Met. This developer told Mr. Gibson that
    despite  his $5000 deposit, he would not close the transaction with respect
    to a unit in the project which was the subject of the loan under consideration,
    because he had bought elsewhere for less money. He also suggested careful
    examination of the legitimacy of the indicated committed purchasers. Although
    Gibson considered the information important and it caused him concern, other
    than place a memo in the file, he did nothing further in relation to the
    call nor did he bring it to anyone else’s attention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that had Standard known of this conversation, it might
    not have entered the transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standard
    considered the proposal and on June 8, 1987, approved the loan subject to
    an amendment to show two commercial and thirteen residential pre-sales producing
    $4,489,375 net after commissions. Standard relied on representations contained
    in the proposal that deposits of $20,000 per unit were being paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    June 8 and 9, 1987, Standard’s requirement with respect to pre-sale proceeds
    changed; in its final form the Commitment Letter between Met and Darrow required
    the borrower to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>show pre-sales net proceeds to lenders of no less
    than $3,895,831.00 and takeout commitments from Vanguard Trust of not less
    than $3,761,450.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standard
    relied in particular on certain conditions in the Commitment Letter:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    takeout financing was to be seventy per cent of the appraised value of all
    unsold units and funded on substantial completion of the project;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    Morguard (Met) confirm to its satisfaction all agreements of purchase and
    sale with respect to all unit sales;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Morguard
    (Met) shall receive an assignment of all agreements of purchase and sale
    for this project as well as an assignment of all sales deposits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    letter dated July 23, 1987 Met sent thirteen Agreements of Purchase and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale plus three leases to Standard. On that letter, Mr. Thrower of Standard
    made a note that “all sales confirmed $20,000 deposit”. Mr. Thrower testified
    that this information was conveyed to him in a telephone conversation with
    Mr. Simpson of Met and satisfied him that the required deposits were paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the following day of July 24, 1987, Mr. Simpson wrote to Standard and provided
    detailed information in respect of the pre-sold units which represented that
    Standard’s condition in relation to net proceeds and takeout commitments
    had been met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commitment Letter also required Met to confirm to its satisfaction all Agreements
    of Purchase and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Sale of the units. These agreements required a deposit of $5000 on the purchaser
    signing and a further $15,000 to be paid within five days of the purchaser
    being provided with a copy of the agreement signed by the vendor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found while there were more than $3,895,000 in pre-sales, only
    two of the sales had a deposit of $20,000. Seven had put down only the initial
    $5000; several had put down nothing. Mr. Simpson of Met conceded he should
    have done more to confirm the pre-sales. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Darrow
    defaulted under the mortgage on April 22, 1988 when thirty-four liens were
    registered totalling $1,664,096.84. On March 30, 1988 Standard was owed $2,549,408.30
    inclusive of interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the default efforts were made to sell the project for sufficient money to
    pay off the liens and recover the mortgage advances, but without success.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 10, 1988 Met informed Standard that with respect to the project now
    being closed, in view of the project’s stage of development and the terms
    of the Commitment Letter, there ought to have been $422,500 in deposits for
    thirteen agreements for sale of residential units (13 x $32,500). However,
    there was only $60,000, leaving a shortfall of $362,500.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 1988 Standard wrote to advise Met that by not securing the deposit
    monies as required under the terms of the Commitment Letter, Met had breached
    the duty of care owed to Standard. Met was told Standard would hold it liable
    for any loss incurred. The property was valued at between $5 million and
    $6 million dollars as it was, at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    their efforts to sell the project “as is” were unsuccessful, Met and Standard
    agreed to build out the project to mitigate their losses. They received a
    number of offers, the best of which came from Wachter, a customer of Standard
    on several other projects. Wachter offered $6 million, plus a new second
    mortgage of $2.5 million. Met expressed concerns about Wachter’s experience,
    but eventually agreed to accept Wachter’s offer when pressed by Standard
    to do so. Met and Standard each agreed to provide fifty per cent of the additional
    funding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately
    an agreement was reached with Wachter whereby 772792 was to pay $500,000
    subject to adjustments in cash, a first mortgage of $5.5 million, a second
    mortgage of $3 million but only $2.7 million to be advanced and a third mortgage
    for $500,000 to secure a profit sharing interest.  On November 15, 1988,
    in accordance with the agreement between Met and Wachter as approved by Standard,
    the lien trustee sold the project to 772792 pursuant to a foreclosure and
    vesting order. All other interests were foreclosed. The sale was pursuant
    to the provisions of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>. It was not a sale
    pursuant to the <i>Mortgages Act</i>. Darrow was not served and the trial
    judge noted there was no issue and no adjudication as between Met and Darrow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    of December 31, 1988 Darrow owed Standard $2,900,480.55 inclusive of interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 5, 1989, a cheque for $19,000, being one half of the Trustee’s rebate,
    was received by Standard and credited to the Darrow loan. On January 20,
    1989, the Supreme Court of Ontario released $521,442.63 for Darrow, which
    was equally divided between Standard and Met. Standard credited its half
    of $260,721.32 to the Darrow loan, leaving about $2,600,000 owing on the
    Darrow loan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 6, 1989 Standard paid itself by way of two cheques totalling $2,750,000.
    This was nothing more than a bookkeeping entry because Standard did not actually
    receive these funds, but the entry did note the Darrow account was being “Dis
    in full eff Jan. 25/89”. Although the maker of the note was not called to
    testify, it would be difficult to infer any meaning to the notation other
    than “discharged in full effective January 25, 1989”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its annual reports filed with the Office of the Federal Inspector of Institutions,
    Standard reported in relation to the Darrow loan:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 31, 1988, Darrow was noted as being in default of interest on the
    first mortgage for more than 6 months and 772792 was noted as giving a second
    mortgage for $1.5 million;</p>

    December 31, 1989, there was no mention of Darrow regarding loans in excess
    of $250,000 or loans in default, and 772792 was noted in reference to first
    and second mortgages with neither noted to be in default.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a printout of the Darrow loan made February 21, 1994, Darrow was written
    off as at January 25, 1989 and the account closed. This corresponds with
    the file notation referenced in paragraph 27 above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Met’s
    concerns about Wachter’s experience proved true. The project was fraught
    with difficulties from the outset of his involvement. Contrary to the advice
    of its professionals, Standard insisted that advances continue to be made
    to Wachter. In late 1989 mortgage interest fell into arrears and construction
    lien problems arose. The last mortgage advance was made on January 5, 1990,
    leaving a balance owing of $2,932,500, less a lien holdback of $67,500.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wachter
    defaulted on January 29, 1991 and on the same date Met gave Notice of Sale
    Under Mortgage for $3,149,929.34. The mortgagor foreclosed July 2, 1991.
    Met and Standard completed the building in 1994-1995 at a cost in excess
    of $1.2 million. There was a resulting net deficit of over $700,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Met
    obtained judgment against Wachter on the second mortgage. There is no judgment
    against either Wachter or Darrow on the first mortgage of approximately $5.5
    million. Met did not third party Darrow in this proceeding.</p>
  <h3><u>The Issues</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue raised on the appeal is whether the trial judge erred in law in
    assessing damages solely on the basis of contractual principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Met had confirmed to Standard that $20,000 had
    been paid on each deposit when in fact that was not so. However, he went
    on to conclude that the issue of the deposits became academic when the agreement
    between Met and Darrow (the Commitment Letter) switched from the number of
    sales to the net proceeds of sale and takeout financing requirements. The
    trial judge found that the total net pre-sales were $460,000 below the minimum
    required in the terms of the Commitment Letter. It was for Met to confirm
    those numbers and in failing to do so, Met was in breach of its contract
    with Standard. In addition, the trial judge found that same conduct of failing
    to satisfy itself as to the purchases amounted to negligence on the part
    of Met in fulfilling its duty of care to Standard. He found Met liable for
    negligent misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge further concluded that Met’s conduct constituted breach of the
    fiduciary duty owed to Standard and breach of trust. His conclusions in this
    regard are supported by the evidence and the language of the MAA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Met had provided Standard with copies of the Agreements of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale, there was no way for Standard to determine whether deposits had been
    paid. Only Met had the ability to establish the legitimacy of those pre-sales,
    and Met was the sole contact with Darrow. By withholding information or providing
    inaccurate information, Met had the ability to unilaterally affect the rights
    of Standard, thus rendering Standard particularly vulnerable to the exercise
    of that absolute power or discretion. On this basis the trial judge concluded
    Met was more than a mere contractual agent of Standard; its obligation, he
    said, was indistinguishable from that of a trustee or fiduciary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Standard would not have authorized the release of
    its funds July 24, 1987 if it had been aware of the true state of the pre-sales
    prior to that advance. However, he also concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The loss sustained here was caused not so much
    because of the breach of trust respecting pre-sales, payment of pre-existing
    interest and an affidavit, as by the subsequent events such as the sale to
    Mr. Wachter. The sale itself to Mr. Wachter was reasonable mitigation. However
    Standard’s subsequent actions in Mr. Wachter’s interest were not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted that the proper remedy for breach of trust was an award
    of damages on a restitutionary scale: Standard is entitled to be put in as
    good a position as it would have been had the breach not occurred. He also
    concluded, however, that Met’s breach in failing to establish the pre-sale
    on July 24, 1987 had little or no effect on the ultimate failure of the project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the mortgage to Wachter was an entirely new transaction – a <i>novus actus</i> – which
    broke the chain of causation, constituting a new cause for which Met was
    not liable. The appellant concedes the events of the Wachter era are remote.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of his reasons, the trial judge briefly reviewed the law in
    relation to breach of contract and stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that because of the negligent misrepresentation
    and breach of trust, Met is solely responsible for the loss until November
    15, 1988.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    went on to conclude that the amount owing on the mortgage to that point in
    time was $2,529,372.70.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s findings in relation to causation
    and submits that the trial judge confused the concepts of causation and mitigation.
    Standard argues that the issue is not
    “what caused the whole loss?” but rather “what caused the initial loss?”  It
    is submitted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly, Met Trust’s liability caused the initial
    loss under the Darrow mortgage, which ended at the damages assessment date
    of either:  (1) August 18, 1988 – the date of Standard’s notice or demand
    letter; or (2) November 15, 1988 – the date of the vesting orders transferring
    title to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Brockville property to Wachter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. The appellant’s argument is artificial and entirely misses the
    reality of the situation. What Standard wants is akin to the ancient parable
    of having one’s cake and eating it too.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    look at the Darrow loan in isolation is to ignore reality. Here the appellant
    willingly substituted Wachter’s company for Darrow. It replaced Darrow with
    772792 on its books; it has not pursued Darrow in any way for payment. Standard
    was clearly an eager participant in the events leading up to the November
    15, 1988 vesting order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s conclusion that the non-disclosure of pre-sales really had
    little to do with the ultimate failure of this project is a critical finding
    against the appellant and one which is overwhelmingly supported in the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    McLachlin J. (as she then was) noted in <i>Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton &amp;
    Co.</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534 at 556:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Foreseeability is not a concern in assessing compensation,
    but it is essential that the losses made good are only those which, on a
    common sense view of causation, were caused by the breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question is whether, applying a common sense
    view of causation, the further losses sustained in the course of construction
    can be said to have resulted or flowed from the breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court emphasizes a “common sense view of causation”
    and  that only those resulting losses –
    after the application of the “common sense view of causation” test be made
    good. The comment by Lambert J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    at p. 182 of that judgment are instructive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rubric “breach of fiduciary duty” has come
    to encompass so many different types of liability that it is not now possible
    to determine the appropriate remedy by defining the wrong simply as a “breach
    of fiduciary duty”. It is necessary, instead, to look through the categorization
    of the wrong as a “breach of fiduciary duty” to the true nature of the wrong,
    and to move from there to the determination of the remedy. The nature of
    the wrong and the nature of the loss, not the nature of the cause of action,
    will dictate the scope of the remedy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    LaForest wrote separate concurring reasons in <i>Canson</i> and at p. 588
    of the decision noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But, as those cases underline, equity cannot be
    rigidly applied. Its doctrines must be attuned to different circumstances.
    Quite obviously not all fiduciary obligations are the same. It would be wholly
    inappropriate to interpret equitable doctrines so technically as to displace
    common law rules that achieve substantial justice in areas of common concern,
    thereby leading to harsh and inequitable results. I whole heartedly reject
    the notion advanced by the appellants that the Court of Appeal fell “into
    error because of a misplaced concern with concepts of common sense and reasonableness”.
    I would have thought these concerns were central to both common law and equity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view the trial judge here did, as <i>Canson</i> directs, on a common sense
    and reasonable consideration of the evidence, conclude what the losses were
    that flowed from the breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge held Met responsible for Standard’s losses to November 15,
    1988, the date of the vesting order transferring the property to 772792,  he
    concluded those losses were modest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    substitution of 772792 for Darrow was a <i>novus actus</i> and the appellant
    concedes the losses thereafter to be remote. Standard not only agreed to
    the substitution, but urged the less willing Met to accept Wachter’s offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge looked at matters as of November 15, 1988. He concluded at that
    point Standard was owed $2,529,372.70 after giving credit for certain amounts
    recovered. He then reviewed certain offers to take over the project which
    had been received by Met and Standard. The details concerning those offers
    were in evidence before the trial judge as part of the Agreed Statement of
    Facts which was Exhibit 16 at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    concluded, even accepting the lowest of those offers, Standard’s loss did
    not exceed $203,000. Had he used other higher offers there would have been
    no damage suffered by the appellant as of November 15, 1988. He merely used
    the Wood’s offer as a comparator and one which benefited the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, I see no error in the trial judge’s findings and I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h3><u>The Cross-Appeal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main thrust of the cross-appeal is that there has been a novation between
    the lenders, Standard and Met, and between the lenders and Darrow, which
    had the effect of discharging any debt owed on the Darrow loan. On this basis
    the respondent argues the action ought to have been dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty with the argument is that Standard is not a party to the Darrow
    loan; only Met is party to the loan agreements and the mortgage. Standard’s
    cause of action against Met arises because of the MMA contract between them,
    and not as the result of its dealings with any particular debtor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument may well be a valid one to any claim advanced by Met but it cannot,
    in my view, succeed against Standard on these facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the cross-appeal. Costs to the respondent fixed in the all-inclusive
    sum of $50,000.</p>
