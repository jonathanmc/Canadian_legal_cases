    appeal raises issues of foreign law.  The first issue concerns the standard
    of appellate review to be applied to questions of foreign law determined
    by a trial judge.  The second issue concerns the application of the personal
    property security legislation in
    <st1:State

    Ontario.  If they had done a search on the day of the transactions, they
    would have found nothing registered against the Corvette.  Twelve days later,
    the finance company registered its security interest (pursuant to a conditional

    Ontario purchasers were presumed to have knowledge of the finance company’s
    security interest.  The trial judge further found that the purchasers’ presumed
    good faith conduct in proceeding as they did was rebutted by their failure
    to act with due diligence.  In the result, the trial judge awarded damages
    against the purchasers, who now appeal to this court.</p>

  <h2>THE FACTS</h2>
  <h2>The Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale of the Corvette</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    complex chain of transactions gave rise to this case.  On November 24, 1999,
    9069-7368 Quebec Inc. (“9069”) of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal purchased a 1999 Corvette from Wilhelmy Chevrolet Geo Oldsmobile
    Cadillac Limit<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>e (“Wilhelmy”) in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Repentigny,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec.  A conditional sales agreement was signed the same day and Wilhelmy
    assigned it to General Motors Acceptance Corporation of Canada, Limited (“GMAC”),
    who financed the purchase by advancing funds to 9069.  After delivery, a
    second numbered company, 9066-1141 (“9066”), took possession of the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 25, 1999, one of the appellants, Town and Country Chrysler Limited
    (“T &amp; C”) of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Smiths Falls,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, purchased the Corvette from 9066 for $60,990.  9066 represented
    to T &amp; C that there existed no interest in the Corvette other than that
    of the vendor – a long-time wholesale vendor of vehicles to T &amp;
    C.  There was no notice of any interest of GMAC.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    same day that T &amp; C purchased the Corvette, it sold the car to the other
    appellant, Devolin Auto Group Ltd. (“Devolin”) of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Belleville,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 9, 1999, Devolin sold the Corvette to Brisbee Motor Sales in

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

  <h2>The Security Interest of GMAC</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    GMAC advanced the funds for the purchase of the Corvette pursuant to a conditional
    sales agreement of November 24, 1999, GMAC did not register its security
    interest in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Quebec with the Register of Personal and Movable Real Rights (“RPMRR”) until
    December 7, 1999.  The RPMRR was then a new personal property registration
    system which came into operation in September 1999.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC
    did not register its security interest in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario under the <i>Personal Property Security Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    P.10, (“PPSA”) until January 24, 2000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 17, 2000, GMAC sent a letter to the appellants advising of its security
    interest in the Corvette and claiming damages against the appellants.</p>
  <h2>The Action</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GMAC
    sought declaratory relief concerning its security interest in the Corvette
    and damages in the amount of $50,000 against the appellants.  GMAC claimed
    that when T
    &amp; C purchased the Corvette from 9066 on November 25, 1999, and when Devolin,
    in turn, purchased it from T &amp; C, GMAC had a valid registered security
    interest in the Corvette pursuant to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec law.  GMAC invoked Article 1745 of the <i>Civil Code</i> <i>of Quebec</i>,
    S.Q. 1991, c. 64, which provides that the registration of a security interest
    has a retroactive effect to the date of sale as long as registration is completed
    within 15 days of the sale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the date of registration (December 7, 1999) is within 15 days
    of the date of the initial purchase and sale (November 24, 1999).  Therefore
    GMAC’s security interest was valid on November 24, 1999.  GMAC further argued
    that pursuant to s. 5(2)(a) of the PPSA, its registration in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario on January 24, 2000 (within 60 days after the car entered
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario), perfected its
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec security in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and entitled it to recovery in the courts of this province.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants argued that GMAC’s security interest was not valid
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec because under the <i>Civil Code</i> the presumption of knowledge of
    registration of a purchaser is rebuttable.  T &amp; C and Devolin could not
    reasonably have been expected to know of GMAC’s security interest since no
    registration existed at the time they dealt with the Corvette.  Both appellants
    were unaware of the RPMRR, which had been established only three months prior
    to the transactions.  In any event, even if searches had been conducted at
    the relevant times, they would have produced negative results.  The appellants
    submitted that they acted in good faith, which is presumed under Article
    2805 of the <i>Civil Code</i>, and that their good faith rebutted the presumption
    of knowledge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants further argued that GMAC’s registration in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario gave it no greater right in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario than it would have had in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec.  Since there was no valid registration in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Quebec at the time of the transactions, there could be no valid registration
    of a security interest in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <h2>THE TRIAL </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Central
    to the case was whether GMAC’s security interest in the Corvette had been
    perfected in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Quebec so as to be binding on third parties, including the appellants.  This
    required calling expert evidence on
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec law and, in particular, on the legal effect of the RPMRR registration
    system.  Each side called a practising commercial lawyer in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec to provide such evidence.  Before referring to the expert evidence,
    I will set out the relevant provisions of the <i>Civil Code</i> and of the
    PPSA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relevant statutory provisions of the RPMRR registration system contained
    in the <i>Civil Code </i>are as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>932.    A possessor is in good faith if, when his
    possession begins, he is justified in believing he holds the real right he
    is exercising.  His good faith ceases from the time his lack of title or
    the defects of his possession or title are notified to him by a civil proceeding.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1745.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An instalment
    sale is a term sale by which the seller reserves ownership of the property
    until full payment of the sale price.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A reservation of ownership in respect of a road
    vehicle or other movable property determined by regulation, or in respect
    of any moveable property acquired for the service or operation of an enterprise,
    has effect against third persons only if it has been published; effect against
    third persons operates from the date of the sale provided the reservation
    of ownership is published within 15 days.  As well, the transfer of such
    a reservation has effect against third persons only if it has been published.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2805. Good faith is always presumed, unless the
    law expressly requires that it be provided.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2846.  A presumption is an inference established
    by law or the court from a known fact to an unknown fact.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2847. A legal presumption is one that is specially
    attached by law to certain facts; it exempts the person in whose favour it
    exists from making any other proof.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A presumption concerning presumed facts is simple
    and may be rebutted by proof to the contrary; a presumption concerning deemed
    facts is absolute and irrebuttable.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2943.  … A right registered in the register of personal
    and movable real rights…is presumed known by a person acquiring or publishing
    a right in the same property.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2944.  Registration of a right in the register of
    personal and moveable real rights or the land register carries, in respect
    of all persons, simple presumption of the existence of that right.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2969.  … a register of personal and movable real
    rights is kept in the Personal and Moveable Real Rights Registry Office.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2970.  … Rights concerning a movable and any other
    rights are published by registration in the register of personal and moveable

    respondent’s expert, Stephen Hamilton of the Quebec Bar, gave evidence in
    respect of two of the Civil Code provisions that are relevant to the RPMRR
    system.  He read into the record Article 1745 concerning the retroactive
    effect of publication (registration) within 15 days of the sale.  He then
    made brief reference to the registration in this case.  Mr. Hamilton also
    read into the record the provisions of Article 2943 concerning the presumption
    of knowledge by third parties claiming a right in the same property registered
    in the RPMRR system.  Counsel then asked Mr. Hamilton what steps a prudent
    purchaser would take in a case such as the case at bar.  Mr. Hamilton suggested
    the following steps:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>check

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)     wait for the 15-day period to expire;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)     retain the purchase price until the expiry
    of 15 days and check the register again; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)     inquire more closely as to the chain of
    title back to the dealer. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Mr. Hamilton was not asked about
    and he gave no evidence as to what might rebut the presumption of knowledge
    under Article 2943.  He was also not asked about and gave no evidence in

    McMartin of the Quebec Bar testified for the appellants.  Like Mr. Hamilton,
    Mr. McMartin also made reference to Articles 1745 and 2943 concerning retroactive
    registration and presumed knowledge of third parties.  He then explained
    that the presumption of knowledge is a simple presumption rebuttable by proof
    to the contrary in accordance with Article 2847.  </p>

  <h2>The trial judge’s conclusion re GMAC’s security interest in Quebec</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, without reference to the expert evidence, concluded in respect
    of GMAC’s security interest in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Quebec as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my opinion, the Defendants should still be presumed
    to have known of GMAC’s interest in the Corvette, despite their arguments
    to the contrary, and despite the apparent unfairness of that conclusion.  This
    presumption has not been rebutted, for four reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the dispute is governed by the current version of Article 2943, the Defendants
    are precluded from arguing that their
    “good faith” conduct rebuts the presumption of constructive knowledge.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the dispute is governed by the former version of Article 2943, and good faith
    is available to rebut the presumption of constructive knowledge of GMAC’s
    security interest, any alleged good faith on the part of the Defendants is
    in turn rebutted by convincing evidence that the Defendants did not act with
    due diligence.  Neither Defendant bothered to make any search or inquiry
    into the validity of their title to the Corvette.  It is immaterial that
    any such search or inquiry on November 25, 1999 would not have revealed GMAC’s
    interest; the test is whether, given all the circumstances and adopting an
    objective standard, the Defendants did all that they reasonably could do
    in order to inform themselves of the validity of their title to the vehicle.  In
    my opinion, the Defendants’ conduct does not appear to have met this standard.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, a property right in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec pre-dates and exists independently of the registration and publication
    of that right.  While publication of a right permits the enforcement of a
    person’s rights against third parties, the failure to publish or any delay
    in publication does not extinguish the existence or effect of the right.  Therefore,
    even if the Defendants could rebut the presumption of constructive knowledge
    of GMAC’s security interest, that interest still exists and is retroactive
    to November 24, 1999.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is clear that GMAC complied with Quebec legislation, and properly registered
    its security interest in the Corvette within the time limit prescribed by
    the <i>Civil Code</i> so as to take advantage of a 15-day retroactivity period
    [that] is a valid part of a legislative provision which is still in force
    and in effect, and which has yet to be challenged, struck out, read down,
    or declared inapplicable.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span

    for the appellant relies upon the following statement of Sedgwick J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice in <i>Bank of Nova Scotia v. Wassef</i>, [2000]
    O.J. No. 4883 at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While proof of foreign law is treated in our courts
    as a question of fact, it is “a question of fact of a peculiar kind”.  <i>Parkasho
    v. Singh</i>, [1967] 1 All E.R. 737, 746 per Cairns J. “To describe it as
    one of fact is no doubt apposite, in the sense that the applicable law must
    be ascertained according to the evidence of witnesses, yet there can be no
    doubt that what is involved is at bottom a question of law.  That has been
    recognized by the courts”.  Cheshire
    &amp; North’s: Private Inter-national Law (11<sup>th</sup> Ed.), 106.  For
    example, in a jury trial, a question of foreign law is determined by the
    judge; not by the jury.  In appellate proceedings, the same deference will
    not be shown to a trial judge’s findings on a question of foreign law as
    on findings of other facts.  The appellate court will examine the evidence
    of foreign law which was before the trial judge and, may substitute its own
    interpretation of the foreign law.  And while proof of foreign law is a question
    of fact, the effect of the proven facts on the rights of the parties is a
    question of law.  <i>Re</i> <i>McDonald</i> [1935] 4 D.L.R. 342 (NSCA).</p>

    my view, the rationale that supports a high degree of deference for findings
    of fact made by a trial judge does not apply to findings and determinations
    made in respect of foreign law.  Those factors, supporting a high degree
    of deference to a trial judge’s findings of fact, are either not present
    in a trial judge’s consideration of foreign law or, if they are present,
    they are not significant.</p>

    credibility of an expert witness testifying on legal issues is, in my view,
    just as easily assessed on appellate review as at trial.  A witness testifying
    on questions of law is testifying on issues squarely within the province
    of an appellate court, which is well accustomed to evaluating the persuasiveness
    of legal arguments.  The question of time and the allocation of judicial
    resources is simply not a significant issue when it comes to questions of
    foreign law.  While globalization is a fact of life,
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus, in English courts, although the existence
    of English law is a question of law to be determined by authorities in argument,
    the existence of Scots, colonial or foreign law is treated as a question
    of fact to be determined by evidence; so that, in the House of Lords or Privy
    Council, what was a question of fact in the court below, to be established
    by evidence, may become on appeal a question of law to be judicially noticed.</p>

    is the result of this error?  I find guidance in the following words of Lord
    Greene, M.R., in <i>Rouyer Guillet et Cie. v. Rouyer Guillet &amp; Co.</i>,
    [1949] 1 All E.R. 244 (C.A.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I would add that when you come to the statute law
    itself, although it is right that <i>prima facie</i> what must be considered
    is the evidence of the experts and not the text of the law, when the experts
    differ as to its meaning an English court is entitled and, if it is to perform
    its function properly, is, indeed, bound, to apply its own mind, fortified
    by the opinion of the witnesses and giving what weight it thinks ought to
    be given to it, to the text itself and to examine it in order to make up
    its mind on the question of interpretation as between the two sets of witnesses.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Although the situation referred
    to by Lord Greene (that of conflicting expert evidence) was different from
    that in the case at bar, I conclude that where the trial judge fails to make
    findings in respect of the evidence of foreign law, this court is at liberty “to
    apply its own mind” to the questions of foreign law.  This approach also
    comports with the conclusion that the standard of appellate review is correctness.</p>

    issue of good faith arises in respect of rebutting the appellant’s presumed
    knowledge of GMAC’s security interest in the Corvette at the time of its
    purchase.  For convenience, I repeat the definition of good faith found in
    Article 932 of the Quebec Civil Code:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A possessor is in good faith if, when his possession
    begins, is justified in believing he holds the real right he is exercising.  His
    good faith ceases from the time his lack of title or the defects of his possession

style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s first reason for concluding that the presumption of the appellant’s
    knowledge of GMAC’s security interest had not been rebutted was that the
    current version of Article 2943 precludes the appellants from arguing that
    their good faith conduct rebuts the presumption.  The current version of
    Article 2943 expressly provides that, “a person who does not consult the

    problem with this rationale, which the judge appeared to acknowledge in part,
    is that the new version of Article 2943 came into effect on October 9, 2001 – nearly
    two years after the transactions involving the Corvette.  The appellant’s
    expert was asked in cross-examination why the Legislature made the amendment
    to Article 2943 and he responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have not checked that, but I can presume that
    certain clients such as GMAC or other financing companies must have not been
    too happy about the way the courts were interpreting section 2493 as it was
    before, because people could allege – say in good faith, rebut the presumption.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his second reason, the trial judge asserted that even if good faith was available
    to rebut the presumption of constructive knowledge, such “good faith on the
    part of the [appellants] is in turn rebutted by convincing evidence that
    the [appellants] did not act with due diligence.”  As noted above, the trial
    judge said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Neither Defendant bothered to make any search or
    inquiry into the validity of their title to the Corvette.  It is immaterial
    that any such search or inquiry on November 25, 1999 would not have revealed
    GMAC’s interest; the test is whether, given all the circumstances and adopting
    an objective standard, the Defendants did all that they reasonably could
    do in order to inform themselves of the validity of their title to the vehicle.  In
    my opinion, the Defendants’ conduct does not appear to have met this standard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot discern exactly what the trial judge had in mind when he said that
    it was immaterial that a search of the register would have produced negative
    results on November 25, 1999.  However, in the above paragraph, I believe
    he was likely alluding to the evidence of Mr. Hamilton who said what a prudent
    purchaser in the position of T &amp; C would have done if such a purchaser
    had found no registration against the Corvette.  Those steps included:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>wait
    for the 15-day period to expire;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>retain
    the purchase price until the expiry of 15 days and check the register again;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>inquire
    more closely as to the chain of title back to the dealer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third reason that the trial judge gave for his conclusion is that “even if
    the [appellants] could rebut the presumption of constructive knowledge of
    GMAC’s security interest, that interest still exists and is retroactive to
    November 24, 1999”.  With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I do
    not understand this point.  The fact that GMAC still has a security interest
    in the car has nothing to do with whether a third party purchaser can rebut
    the presumption of constructive knowledge.  If a third party can rebut the
    presumption, he or she is not fixed with constructive knowledge and is free
    of the consequences of registration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge asserted that GMAC had complied with the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec legislation for registration and was entitled to take advantage of
    the registration’s retro-active effect.   I do not believe that this rationale
    adds to the analysis. </p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the evidence of Mr. Hamilton, as to the steps that a prudent purchaser
    would take in the circumstances of T &amp; C is sufficient to rebut the presumption
    of good faith of both T &amp; C and Devolin.  This evidence was essentially
    unchallenged in cross-examination and appears on its face to produce a sensible
    approach.  I include Devolin because, although it was one step removed from
    the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec transaction, it was aware of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec purchase.  Also counsel for the appellants, quite properly, did not
    distinguish between their positions.  The result of this analysis also fits
    with the definition of good faith in Article 932 of the <i>Civil Code</i>: “a
    possessor is in good faith if, when his possession began, he is justified
    in believing he holds the real right he is exercising.”  A purchaser who
    fails to take the simple steps referred to by Mr. Hamilton cannot be said
    to be justified in believing he had an unfettered right to the vehicle he/she
    has purchased.  Further, I am not persuaded by the evidence of Mr. McMartin
    that the factors he referred to as supporting the presumption of good faith
    (<i>supra</i> para. 22) changes the analysis.  I also do not agree with the
    evidence of Mr. McMartin that the lack of registration of the Corvette at
    the time of purchase was sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    should add that during the trial and to some extent on the argument of the
    appeal much was made of the fact that the Quebec registration system was
    a new system that had only been in force for some two months and it was therefore
    unfair to fix its retroactive effect on the appellants whose principals had
    no knowledge of it.  It is undoubtedly what the trial judge was referring
    to when he described his conclusion as apparently unfair.   Unfortunately,
    I see no basis in law and in the circumstances here for accepting the newness
    of the system as a relevant consideration.</p>
