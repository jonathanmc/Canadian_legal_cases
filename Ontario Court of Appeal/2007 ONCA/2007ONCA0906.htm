    an appeal from the judgment of Hornblower J. acquitting the respondent on
    a charge of Failure to Report Suspicion of Sexual Abuse contrary to s. 72(4)

    72(4) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4) A person referred to in subsection (5) is guilty
    of an offence if,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       he or she contravenes subsection (1)
    or (2) by not reporting a suspicion; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       the information on which it was based

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent is a gym teacher at St. Clair Secondary School in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sarnia.  His duties include coaching the school’s basketball team, the St.
    Clair Colts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent is also the director of a basketball program for elementary school-aged
    children in the community.  This program operates out of the St. Clair Secondary
    School (SCSS).  The team is known as the St. Clair Mini-Colts, the team uniforms
    are identical to those of the SCSS team, rent for the use of the SCSS facilities,
    if charged, is minimal and the school bus is available for the team’s use.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    coach of the St. Clair Mini-Colts was Jim Miller.  In February, 2005 Mr .Miller
    took the team to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Peterborough for the weekend for an “away” game.  At the end of that weekend,
    the respondent learned that a Mini-Colt team member had told his parents
    that Mr. Miller had sexually touched another boy on the trip.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response to the receipt of this information, the respondent fired the coach
    and met with the parents of team members.  He told the parents that if the
    police became involved he would not take charge of the team and there would
    be “no more basketball.”  He did not report his suspicion about the alleged
    assault and these charges arose as the result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sole issue, as it has evolved, is whether when he received the information,
    the respondent was acting in the course and scope of his employment.  Subsection
    (5) of section 74 lists teachers as one of the persons obliged to report
    any suspicion of a risk that a child may be or have been sexually assaulted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that the issue here raised is a pure question of law and that
    it is essential in the public interest that leave be granted to appeal.  It
    is argued that the judges below erred in interpreting the Act literally whereas
    what is required is a more expansive purposive interpretation and one that
    accords with purpose of the statute:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… to promote the best interests, protection and
    well-being of children, who, due to their age are among the most vulnerable
    members of society. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In its factum, the Crown argues:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The legislation, by making every person obliged
    to report suspected abuse but only penalizing certain professionals for failing
    to do so, intended to hold these professionals to a higher standard.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>And given that teachers play a key
    role in detecting and reporting suspected abuse in situations such as the
    one giving rise to these charges – where a professional acts at the periphery
    of his professional duties, the Act must be interpreted in such a way as
    to err on the side of the inclusiveness so that more children are protected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    is clear, is that the legislators intended that it would only be an offence
    for teachers to fail to report when information comes to them in the course
    of their professional duties.  Otherwise, they are to be treated like other
    individuals who, while obliged to report suspected risk of sexual abuse of
    a child, do not commit an offence for failing to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the respondent’s duties as director of the Mini-Colts was entirely voluntary
    and no part of his duties as a teacher at SCSS.  It was in essence an act
    of community service and although similar to his teaching duties at SCSS,
    in the sense of his coaching a basketball team, was not part of those duties.  Indeed
    it is not clear from the record what the respondent’s precise role with the
    Mini-Colts was.  He is described as a “Director”.  He was not on the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Peterborough trip and Jim Miller was the coach of the team at the relevant
    time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the information concerning the possible sexual assault
    was not received by the respondent while in the course of his professional
    duties.  I am not persuaded the finding was one of pure law and the interpretation
    of the statute.  There seems to be no dispute as to the meaning of the language
    of the statute but rather the application of it to the particular facts – a
    question of mixed fact and law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown has not persuaded me that it is
    “essential in the public interest” that leave be granted.  There are no conflicting
    cases presented and the section has been in force for some time.  There seems
    to be no particular difficulty in the interpretation of this section.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s submission that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s decision in <i>Police Complaints Commissioner v. Dunlop</i> (1995),
    26 O.R. (3d) 582 is a conflicting decision is without merit and is on the
    facts clearly distinguishable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    onus for leave to appeal under the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> is a high
    one.  In my view, the Crown has failed to meet that onus here.  The application
    is dismissed.</p>
