      the application and ordered the appellant to be released on bail pending
      appeal. Mr. Doucette was successful in this regard, due to the quality
      of the work submitted by the private investigator, and his expertise in
      providing appropriate and organized evidence to the court in the documents
      he prepared and filed. On May 18 and August 22, 2006, Mr. George’s bail

      Goudge, Juriansz, and Rouleau heard the appeal. The Court allowed the appeal,

      successful.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;

    order appointing Mr. Doucette to act as counsel for the appellant did not
    fix the rate at which he should be paid for his work on the appeal.  Counsel
    for the Attorney General of Ontario, submitted that fees and disbursements
    in such cases are reimbursed in accordance with provincial legal aid rates.  However,
    there is no statutory or other requirement that such fees be paid at this
    rate.  Section 684(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides
    that the fees are, in effect, negotiable between the Attorney General and
    counsel. If counsel cannot agree upon the fees, either side is entitled to
    have them taxed by the registrar.  This provision, in my view, indicates
    that unless the court itself fixes the counsel fee at the legal aid hourly
    rate in the order appointing counsel, the registrar is not bound to apply
    the legal aid rate.</p>

      as the parties, through negotiation, have failed to agree on the hourly
      rate at which Mr. Doucette should be paid. Accordingly Mr. Doucette has

lang=EN-US>11)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On December 7, 2006 at the hearing of the taxation of fees and disbursements,
      Mr. Doucette submitted that considering the criminal record of Mr. George,
      the seriousness of the conviction and the sentence received, the investigative
      work carried out at the request of the court, the skill and expertise that
      was necessary to distill the information from Mr. George in order to give
      the private investigator proper instructions, and the presentation of the
      fresh evidence required to properly place the matter before the single
      judge and the  panel, made this matter a complex, time consuming  and difficult
      process. However, as a result of such work, Mr. Doucette was placed in
      a position of strength to proceed on a firm basis with his submissions
      at the appeal, which was successful as evidenced by the result.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'>12)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The crown agreed
    with the chronology of the proceedings, the disbursements and the amount
    of hours billed for this matter.  However Ms. Crosbie submitted on behalf
    of the crown, that the case was not complex as trial defence counsel acknowledged
    his incompetence.  I agree with Mr. Doucette's submissions however, that
    the subject matter of this appeal was a conviction for a serious offence,
    and preparing the argument on the fresh evidence application, and on the
    appeal, was time-consuming, complex and somewhat delicate in nature, given
    the fact that while asserting the rights of the appellant, the reputation
    of trial counsel should not unnecessarily or gratuitously be harmed.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%;'>13)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>I heavily rely on the submissions and references of both parties made
      at the taxation hearing, the materials filed, and specific reference to <i>R.
      v. Barton (Court of Appeal File No: C38866)</i> made by Mr.
      Doucette<i> </i>in which the then Deputy Registrar, Mr. Keith Gauntlett,
      taxed fees at an hourly rate of $200.00 per hour for a matter dealing with
      a charge which involved similar issues such as the seriousness of the charge,
      as well as ineffective assistance of counsel, which required similar processes
      to argue this appeal.</span>   </p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'>14)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Although counsel
    for the crown submitted that the practice is to pay legal aid rates in the
    circumstances where the crown is ordered to pay costs, pursuant to an order
    made by the court, I am not constrained to follow a &quot;practice&quot; that
    does not result in a fair and just award in a particular case.  Mr. Doucette
    is a senior counsel whose typical hourly rate for non-legally-aided clients
    is well above the legal aid rate. The hourly rate that he has requested,
    is well below the maximum hourly rate at which clients have retained him.  In
    obtaining an acquittal rather than a new trial, the result was particularly
    favourable for his client.</p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
lang=EN-US>15)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I do not feel that the hourly rate of $150.00 is unreasonable
      in the circumstances, given the general expertise and appellate experience
      of Mr. Doucette in such matters. I will therefore tax Mr. Doucette’s rate,
      as requested, at $150.00 per hour.</span></p>
