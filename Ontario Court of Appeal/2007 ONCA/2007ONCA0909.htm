lang=EN-US>This is a case that involved an allegation of ineffective assistance
      of trial counsel which is the basis of the fresh evidence application,
      and that the learned trial Judge erred in his analysis of the identification

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On February 7, 2007, a panel of this Court consisting of Justices
      Goudge, Blair, and McFarland heard the appeal and the Court reserved judgment
      and Justice Goudge on behalf of the Court also stated that the issues raised
      made the appeal a very difficult case.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'>7)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    order appointing Mr. Doucette to act as counsel for the appellant did not
    fix the rate at which he should be paid for his work on the appeal.  Counsel
    for the Attorney General of Ontario, submitted that fees and disbursements
    in such cases are reimbursed in accordance with provincial legal aid rates.  However,
    there is no statutory or other requirement that such fees be paid at this
    rate.  Section 684(3) of the <b><i>Criminal Code</i></b><i> </i>provides
    that the fees are, in effect, negotiable between the Attorney General and
    counsel. If counsel cannot agree upon the fees, either side is entitled to
    have them taxed by the registrar.  This provision, in my view, indicates
    that unless the court itself fixes the counsel fee at the legal aid hourly
    rate in the order appointing counsel, the registrar is not bound to apply
    the legal aid rate.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Doucette submitted his account to the Attorney General of Ontario
      through a series of 5 accounts, the first 4 accounts at the rate of $150.00
      per hour, and the 5<sup>th</sup> account at a rate of $175.00 per hour,
      which was increased on January 1, 2007.  Travel time was also billed at
      the regular rate of $150.00 per hour.  The Crown made partial payment of
      the first account at the legal aid rate of $92.30 per hour. Both parties
      have failed to agree on the hourly rate at which Mr. Doucette should be
      paid. Accordingly Mr. Doucette applied to have this account taxed.</span></p>

      heard submissions on May 11, 2007 with respect to Mr. Doucette’s application,
      and reserved my decision.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'>10)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>At the hearing of the taxation of fees and disbursements, Mr. Doucette
      submitted that there was no dispute with the amount of hours worked or
      the disbursements on the file. The dispute was the appropriate hourly rate
      for the hours worked. Mr. Doucette also submitted that his fee for non-legally
      aided clients for travel time is the same as preparation time.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'>11)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The crown agreed
    with the disbursements and the amount of hours billed, after this matter
    was reviewed by Legal Aid. However, the issue raised by the crown is that
    the amount of the hourly rate should be paid at the legal aid rate, and that
    the travel time should not be the same hourly rate as preparation time.</p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
style='color:black'>12)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Although
      counsel for the crown submitted that the practice is to pay legal aid rates
      in the circumstances where the crown is ordered to pay costs, pursuant
      to an order made by the court, I am not constrained to follow a &quot;practice&quot; that
      does not result in a fair and just award in a particular case.  Mr. Doucette
      is a senior counsel whose typical hourly rate for non-legally-aided clients
      is well above the legal aid rate. The hourly rate that he has requested
      is well below the maximum hourly rate at which clients have retained him.  Mr.
      Doucette has also not charged any interest on these accounts and did not
      ask for costs as well, in keeping with the interest of public funds</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
style='color:black'>13)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>Accordingly,
      I do not feel that the hourly rates submitted by Mr. Doucette for his counsel
      work are unreasonable in the circumstances, given his general expertise
      and appellate experience in such matters and the complex and difficult
      nature of the appeal.  I do not consider that the modest increase in his
      hourly rate after January 1, 2007 should not be recognized, given that
      it no doubt reflects the realities of the increasing costs in the private
      practice of criminal law, and the fact that considerable work was done
      on behalf of his client during this year.  I will therefore tax Mr. Doucette’s
      rate for the first four accounts, reflecting work done in 2006 at the hourly
      rate of $150.00.  The hourly rate for the final account will be fixed at
      $175 per hour.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
style='color:black'>14)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>With
      respect to his bill for travel time, I take a somewhat different view.  Mr.
      Doucette billed only 1 way for his travel time for 3 of the 4 trips he
      made to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston because he was able to divide the cost of those trips between two
    clients.  Although Mr. Doucette has submitted a claim for these hours at
    his hourly rate, given that the cost will be paid out of public funds, I
    am not prepared to fix his costs for travel time at that rate.  I note that
    the legal aid plan provides a differential between the hourly rate for preparation
    and the hourly rate for travel time.  In my view, the rate I fix for travel
    time should be reduced to reflect a similar differential.  In the circumstances
    I would fix the rate at $100 per hour for travel time.</span></p>
