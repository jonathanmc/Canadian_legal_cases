    Maharaj about her recent trip to

    causing her to miss a full day of work.  During this confinement, the appellant

  <h3>A.        BACKGROUND FACTS</h3>
  <h3>1.         The Prior Relationship</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and Ms. Maharaj began their relationship on December 31, 2003.  About
    three months later, Ms. Maharaj interrupted the relationship.  Her family
    had relocated to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa and she was unhappy with the appellant whom she considered possessive
    and constantly finding fault with her.  In the latter part of 2004, the couple’s
    relationship was intermittent and carried on at a distance.</p>
  <h3>2.         The Trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 11, 2005, Ms. Maharaj went to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Trinidad for a vacation and visit.  She delayed telling the appellant of
    her visit for fear of his reaction.  The appellant does <i>not</i> dispute
    that Ms. Maharaj may have told him about her trip, but maintains that either
    he did not hear what she said or what she told him failed to register with
    him.  </p>
  <h3>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Appellant’s First Trip to Ottawa</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Ms. Maharaj was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad, the appellant arrived at her home looking for her.  She learned
    of this visit from her brother whom she instructed not to advise the appellant
    any further about her plans or whereabouts.  </p>
  <h3><span>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Events of February 4, 2005</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 10:40 a.m. on February 4, 2005, Ms. Maharaj alighted at a bus stop
    at the shopping centre in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa where she worked.  Almost immediately, she saw the appellant walking
    towards her.  She became concerned about why he was there.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant escorted Ms. Maharaj to his car parked nearby.  Once the couple
    were inside the car, the appellant displayed a knife that he was carrying
    and began an interrogation of Ms. Maharaj about her trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad, a subject that he would revisit several times over the entire period
    of her confinement.  The appellant took Ms. Maharaj’s cell phone and told
    her that she would not be going to work that day.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant kept his knife visible as he pressed Ms. Maharaj for the details
    of her trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad.  During the day, the appellant choked and slapped Ms. Maharaj.  He
    ripped a necklace from her neck.  He directed her to call her supervisor
    to say that she would not be at work that day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the next several hours, the appellant drove around and stopped at different
    places in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa area.  He explained to Ms. Maharaj that he was “going through a lot” at
    home and at work.  He asked her repeatedly why she was hurting him and he
    cried frequently.  The appellant became angry when he began to receive telephone
    calls inquiring about his and Ms. Maharaj’s whereabouts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 4:00 p.m., Ms. Maharaj finally convinced the appellant to let her out
    of the car.  She promised not to call the police, but telephoned them as
    soon as she had arrived home with her sister.  Early the following morning,
    the appellant called Ms. Maharaj and asked her why she had broken her promise
    and had called the police.  </p>
  <h3><span>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Arrest of the Appellant</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 10, 2005 the appellant was arrested at his place of work in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga.  In response to a question about what had happened on February
    4, 2005, the appellant said “Love’s rage.  Man, I loved her so much, I just
    didn’t think”.  The appellant denied that he had intended to hurt Ms. Maharaj: “I
    just wanted to scare her”.</p>
  <h3><span>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Prior Plea Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    several pre-trial conferences with a judge of the trial court, the parties
    drafted an Agreed Statement of Facts which included a description of their
    prior relationship and an account of the events of February 4, 2005.  The
    appellant entered guilty pleas before the pre-trial judge on June 26, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    sentencing proceedings were scheduled to take place before the pre-trial
    judge on March 6, 2007, the appellant took issue with a portion of the Agreed
    Statement of Facts that had to do with his prior knowledge of Ms. Maharaj’s
    trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad.  The prosecutor insisted on the admission as drafted as a condition
    of her acceptance of the plea to the lesser offence of unlawful confinement.  The
    sentencing proceedings foundered, the pleas of guilty were struck, and a
    date for a preliminary inquiry selected.  </p>
  <h3>7.         The Pleas of Guilty</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a slight redraft of the original Agreed Statement of Facts, the appellant
    entered guilty pleas to the three counts on which he was arraigned on June
    14, 2007.  Sentencing submissions were made on October 2, 2007 and sentence
    passed on November 6, 2007 more that two and one-half years after the events
    that formed the basis of the charges.  </p>
  <h3>8.         The Materials Filed on Sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge was provided with a pre-sentence report, as well as an addendum
    to that report, several psychiatric reports and a letter from the John Howard
    Society reciting the appellant’s attendance at counselling sessions offered
    by the society.  Ms. Maharaj provided a victim impact statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair reading of the psychiatric reports supports the conclusion that the
    appellant does not suffer from any identifiable mental disorder and is not
    in need of any psychiatric treatment or other intervention.  The psychiatrists,
    one of whom is a forensic psychiatrist, concluded that the risk of recidivism
    is, at worse, minimal.  Both doctors characterized the conduct as an isolated
    instance of aberrant behaviour for which the appellant is truly remorseful.  </p>
  <h3><span>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Effect of the Appellant’s Offences</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s conduct has had and continues to have a significant impact on
    Ms. Maharaj.  She had to take a leave of absence from her work and has repeated
    nightmares.  She was diagnosed with alopecia, a loss of hair because of substantial
    stress, and has attended several counselling sessions in an attempt to resolve
    her post-traumatic stress.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the fall of 2006, Ms. Maharaj returned to work with a keener awareness of
    her surroundings and those with whom she must deal.  Her anxiety has been
    exacerbated by the time taken to resolve the charges against the appellant.</p>
  <h3>B.        THE DECISION OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE</h3>
  <h3>1.         The Position of the Prosecutor</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the prosecutor sought a custodial sentence of twelve months and rejected
    any suggestion that the appellant should serve this sentence in the community.  The
    principles of denunciation and of general deterrence, together with the aggravating
    circumstance that the offences constituted abuse of the appellant’s estranged
    domestic partner, rendered unfit service of the sentence in the community.</p>
  <h3><span>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Position of the Appellant</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant contended that any sentence of imprisonment imposed upon
    the appellant should be served in the community as s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> permits.  Serving the sentence in the community would not endanger
    the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental
    purpose and principles of sentencing.  </p>
  <h3><span>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Decision of the Sentencing Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge rejected the submission that the appellant should serve
    his sentence in the community.  She acknowledged that the appellant had pleaded
    guilty, was a first offender and had “professed remorse”.  Further, the sentencing
    judge accepted that the appellant did not suffer from any psychiatric condition
    that might require intervention and was remorseful for his conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the sentencing judge found several aggravating features.  The
    confinement was protracted.  The appellant had a knife and travelled a substantial
    distance to confront the complainant.  He threatened, choked and assaulted
    her.  She was his former domestic partner.  This conduct caused Ms. Maharaj
    significant and ongoing harm.  A conditional sentence would <i>not</i> meet
    the dominant sentencing principles of repudiation, denunciation and deterrence;
    rather, it would cause the community to lose confidence in the administration
    of justice, thus bring it into disrepute.  </p>
  <h3>C.        THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h3>
  <h3>1.         The Position of the Appellant</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Addario, on behalf of the appellant, identifies three specific errors by
    the sentencing judge to overcome the deference he acknowledges should be
    accorded her decision refusing to permit the appellant to serve his sentence
    in the community according to the terms of a conditional sentence order: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failure
    to award credit for time spent in pre-sentence custody as a result of the
    erroneous assignment of sole responsibility for the delay in disposition
    to the appellant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>improper
    characterization of the appellant’s report to psychiatrists about his conduct
    as an attempt to minimize the nature of the offence to his own advantage;
    and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failure
    to award the appellant credit for the lengthy period during which he was
    out of custody but subject to restrictive terms of judicial interim release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Addario contends that the errors made by the sentencing judge, both individually
    and collectively, affected not only the length but also the manner in which
    the sentence is to be served.  Length and manner of service cannot be disentangled,
    the one from the other.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Addario points out that, even acceeding to the quantum of sentence proposed
    by the prosecutor at trial, in the absence of any requirement of a minimum
    sentence, the appellant was entitled to uncompromised consideration of a
    conditional sentence.  The appellant poses no danger to the community.  He
    is a youthful first offender who is gainfully employed.  The conduct here
    was a “one-off,” not the product of any psychiatric disorder.  The prospect
    of recidivism is remote.  A conditional sentence would be consistent with
    the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing that prevail here.  The
    authorities that command incarceration involve protracted violence different
    in its nature and extent from what happened here, and offenders with established
    records and a palpable prospect of recidivism.  </p>

    Position of the Respondent</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    his part, Mr. McInnes, for the respondent, takes the position that any error
    made by the sentencing judge in the attribution of sole responsibility for
    the delay in concluding proceedings to the appellant, as well as in the failure
    to award credit for time spent in custody or on restrictive terms of judicial
    interim release, is <i>not</i> linked to the refusal to permit service of
    the sentence in the community.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    McInnes says that the appellant adduced no evidence about any hardships encountered
    while he was bound by the judicial interim release order.  The terms of the
    order on their face, are not especially onerous.  Indeed, while bound by
    these terms, the appellant was able to establish a relationship of some permanence
    with another young woman.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge’s characterization of the appellant’s rendition of the circumstances
    of the offence to Dr. Johnson as an attempt to minimize the nature of his
    offences, according to Mr. McInnes, was well-founded.  The version of events
    offered by the appellant and those acknowledged in the Agreed Statement of
    Facts, differ substantially and amply support the sentencing judge’s conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Mr. McInnes, even absent deference, the sentences imposed were fit.  These
    offences were planned.  A weapon was taken along on a lengthy trip the object
    of which was confrontation.  The crimes involved violence and degradation.  The
    entire incident occupied several hours and arose out of a prior domestic
    relationship that the appellant refused to acknowledge was over.  </p>
  <h3>D.        ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>1.         The Scope of Appellate Review</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    courts are bound to show substantial deference to sentences imposed at first
    instance, whether after trial or following entry and acceptance of pleas
    of guilty.  This deference reaches decisions about whether to permit service
    of a sentence of imprisonment in the community.  See, <i>R. v. Ijam</i> 2007
    ONCA 597 at para. 13 <i>per</i> MacPherson J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    interference with a sentence is warranted only if the sentencing judge has
    erred in principle or has imposed a sentence outside the acceptable range
    of sentence.  An error in principle may involve a failure to take into account
    a relevant factor, consideration of an irrelevant factor, assignment of insufficient
    weight to a relevant factor, overemphasis of relevant factors and, on a more
    general level, an error of law.  See, <i>R. v. Rezaie</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C.
    (3d) 97 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at p. 103 <i>per</i> Laskin J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant stakes his claim for appellate interference in the soil of error
    in principle.  He advances no argument that the quantum of sentence imposed
    lies beyond an acceptable range of sentence for offences of which he has
    been convicted, although he takes issue with the manner in which the sentencing
    judge decided the sentence must be served.</p>
  <h3>2.         Failure to Award Credit for Restrictive Terms of Release</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was released from custody four days after his arrest.  The recognizance
    on which he was released required that he:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>live
    with his sureties, his brothers, in their parents’
    house in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>not
    be away from his home except for verifiable employment or with a surety.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The recognizance did <i>not</i> include
    a curfew or permit absence from the home for medical or humanitarian reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge refused to award <i>any</i> credit to the appellant for
    the lengthy period during which the appellant’s liberty had been restricted
    by the terms of his release.  The sentencing judge grounded her refusal to
    award credit on two factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    terms of release were not restrictive, since it did not include house arrest
    or inhibit the appellant’s ability to develop a further romantic relationship;
    and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    lengthy delay in resolving the case, thereby the prolonged period restricted
    liberty, was entirely the fault of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is beyond controversy that the sentencing judge was wrong to assign sole
    responsibility for the delay in resolving the outstanding charges to the
    appellant.  A more accurate assignment would have included a prosecutorial
    contribution.  An earlier resolution foundered because of the prosecutor’s
    insistence on the appellant’s admission of the entire Agreed Statement of
    Facts.  The appellant was not prepared to admit that he knew in advance about
    the complainant’s planned trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trinidad.  The prosecutor then in charge of the case was not prepared to
    proceed absent such an admission, although the complainant could have been
    called to testify on the trial of an issue.  See, <i>Criminal Code</i> s.
    724(3)(e).  This sticking point was later resolved by insertion of wording
    proposed by the appellant’s trial counsel when the first resolution attempt
    began to unravel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of the sentencing judge to refuse credit for the time the appellant
    spent on judicial interim release on the ground that the appellant was <i>wholly</i> responsible
    for the delay in resolution was based on a misapprehension of the reasons
    underlying the failed resolution.  That said, it was open to the trial judge
    to refuse credit on the basis that the appellant had not demonstrated that
    the conditions of release had prejudiced or imposed undue hardship upon him.  See, <i>Ijam</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>
  <h3><span>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Minimization
    of Conduct in Psychiatric Evaluations</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge considered as an aggravating factor the appellant’s minimization
    of his conduct during psychiatric interview.  In the first report of Dr.
    Johnson, for example, the appellant told the psychiatrist that he (the appellant)
    had a fight with and had slapped his girlfriend.  The account reported by
    Dr. Johnson makes no mention of a knife or the necklace the appellant acknowledged
    having ripped from the complainant’s neck.  In a report prepared fifteen
    months later, after correspondence from the appellant’s trial counsel, Dr.
    Johnson noted that the appellant did not deny the presence of the knife or
    the lengthy confinement of Ms. Maharaj in his car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    its face, the account first provided by the appellant to Dr. Johnson about
    the events of February 4, 2005 did minimize the seriousness of the offences
    the appellant later admitted.  But this account was not one in which the
    appellant persisted during his discussions with Dr. Kunjukrishnan or in the
    Agreed Statement of Facts.  </p>
  <h3><span>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Availability of Review</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair reading of the sentencing judge’s reasons as a whole reveals two errors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failure
    to award credit for restrictive judicial interim release terms because of
    an improper assignment of exclusive responsibility for delay in resolution
    to the appellant; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>consideration
    as an aggravating factor of the appellant’s account to Dr. Johnson, a version
    of events on February 4, 2005 that attempted to minimize the seriousness
    of the appellant’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>As a result of these errors, the
    deference due to the sentencing judge’s decision falls away and it becomes
    necessary to consider the fitness of the sentence imposed.  </p>
  <h3><span>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    Fit Sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal complaint about unfitness has to do not with the quantum of sentence
    imposed, but rather with the manner in which the appellant is to serve his
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences of which the appellant has been convicted are not punishable by
    a minimum term of imprisonment.  No one suggests that any term of imprisonment
    imposed should exceed two years.  To determine whether the appellant should
    be permitted to serve his sentence in the community, it is necessary to consider
    whether service of the sentence in the community would endanger the safety
    of the community and be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles
    of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    permit the appellant to serve a sentence of imprisonment of nine months in
    the community would <i>not</i> endanger the safety of the community.  The
    appellant is a first offender who is unlikely to recidivate.  He is gainfully
    employed.  He is not labouring under any major mental illness or related
    condition that would render him a danger to the community, or any identifiable
    segment of that community.  He has strong family support and lives in a stable
    home environment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fundamental purpose of any sentence, according to s. 718 of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>,
    is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for
    the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by the imposition
    of just sanctions with any one or more of several sentencing objectives. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cases involving violence arising out of an existing or failed domestic or
    romantic relationship, the predominant sentencing objectives are denunciation
    and deterrence.  See, <i>R. v. Boucher</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 479 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at p. 488 <i>per</i> Simmons J.A.  Further, sentences imposed must promote
    a sense of responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgement of the harm
    done, not only to the immediate victim, but also to the community at large.  In
    cases like this, the likelihood of enduring psychological trauma to the victim
    from the irrational, controlling and obsessive nature of the misconduct is
    significant.  See, <i>Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 487 <i>per</i> Simmons
    J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    case is different.  Some cases warrant conditional sentences.  Others do
    not.  This case involves planned conduct.   The appellant refused to accept
    rejection and to acknowledge the end of his relationship with the complainant.  Instead,
    bent on confrontation, he armed himself with a knife and drove from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  He planned to confront the victim, by his own admission, to scare
    her.  The confinement lasted several hours.  The victim missed work and was
    compelled to lie to her employer about the reasons for her absence.  She
    was assaulted, a chain ripped from around her neck.  The appellant’s conduct
    demeaned and degraded her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the appellant’s conduct the victim had to take a leave of absence
    from her work.  She required therapy and counselling and reports increased
    anxiety and a prolonged period of post-traumatic stress.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a close case.  Despite the errors made by the sentencing judge, I am satisfied
    that she reached the correct result in rejecting the claim for service of
    the sentence in the community.  Unlawful confinement, brandishment of a weapon
    and assault will not be tolerated as acceptable methods to rekindle a flagging
    romantic relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
