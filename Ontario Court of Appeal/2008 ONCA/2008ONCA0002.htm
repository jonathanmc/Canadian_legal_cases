      respondents are the parents, sister, and grandmother of twin girls who
      were born severely disabled, as well as the twins themselves. The appellant
      became the mother’s obstetrician after her first daughter was born prematurely
      and before she became pregnant with the twins. When the mother failed to
      begin ovulating after discontinuing birth control pills, the appellant
      prescribed the fertility drug Clomid. The Clomid was the first link in
      a chain of causation that led to the conception of the twins, the premature
      birth of the twins and the damage caused to them as a result of their premature
      birth.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      action against the doctor was based on his failure to provide all the necessary
      information to allow the mother to make an informed decision whether to
      take Clomid: the extent of the increased risk of having twins by taking
      the drug, the potential for premature birth when carrying twins, and the
      consequent injury this might cause to them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      jury found the doctor negligent for failing to provide the necessary information
      to the mother. They also found on the issue of causation, that had the
      mother been told all the risks, she would not have taken the Clomid. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Following
      those findings and the jury’s award of damages, the trial judge ruled,
      as a matter of law, that this was a case where the doctor also owed a duty
      of care to the twins. Because he breached that duty, they as well as their
      parents were entitled to recover damages. She concluded that the claim
      by the twins did not come within the category of action known as “wrongful
      life” because this was not a case where the doctor’s negligence only caused
      the twins to be born; in this case, the doctor’s negligence caused not
      only the birth of the twins, but also their damage. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge further ruled that the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Krangle
      v. </i></span><i>Brisco</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 205, which held that parents
      of a disabled child could not recover for the costs of care of the child
      once he was over the age of eighteen under statutory provisions in British
      Columbia, did not preclude a trier of fact in Ontario from awarding such
      damages.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals on three grounds: (1) the verdict of the jury on causation
    was unreasonable; (2) the trial judge erred in concluding that this was not
    a case in the category of “wrongful life”, where the law in Canada does not
    recognize a cause of action; and (3) the trial judge erred in law in her
    interpretation and application of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
    in <i>Krangle v. Brisco</i>.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the filing of the notice of appeal, the parties entered into a binding settlement
    agreement, approved by the trial judge on behalf of the infants, which will
    be effective based on the outcome of the appeal. It was also agreed and made
    the subject of a consent order by the Associate Chief Justice that the existence
    of this settlement agreement would be disclosed to the court. The agreement
    provides for a non-recoverable payment by the appellant of $5.1 million,
    which has already been paid. If the appeal is dismissed in its entirety,
    the appellant will pay a further $4 million. If the appeal is dismissed on
    the causation issue, but allowed on either of the other two issues, the payment
    will be reduced by $500,000 for each such issue.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    her first marriage, Mrs. Bovingdon had an early miscarriage, then bore her
    daughter Lindsey prematurely at twenty-eight weeks gestation in 1987. Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon
    was in the hospital for three-and-a-half weeks before the birth, as well
    as for several weeks afterwards with the baby. The baby’s health was initially
    precarious, but she was eventually fine. Mrs. Bovingdon attributed her problems
    with childbirth to her tendency to become pregnant shortly after going off
    the birth control pill, as well as to the stress of her unhappy first marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Bovingdon began to see Dr. Hergott as her obstetrician following Lindsey’s
    birth but while she was still married to her first husband. She divorced
    in 1990 and married Tim Bovingdon in 1991. The couple wanted to have children,
    but because of her history, Mrs. Bovingdon was concerned about any future
    pregnancy. Mrs. Bovingdon  stopped taking birth control pills in September
    1991 but her periods did not resume. Nevertheless, on three occasions in
    October 1991, November 1991, and January 1992, she believed she was pregnant
    but each time tested negative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    her January 1992 appointment with Dr. Hergott, they discussed her desire
    to become pregnant again in the context of her history. It was her recollection
    and understanding that Dr. Hergott said to her at that time that “he felt
    confident he could get me through a single pregnancy but twins were out of
    the question.” Dr. Hergott denied making that statement, although he acknowledged
    that they would have discussed the increased risk of premature birth in the
    case of twins. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    also discussed why Mrs. Bovingdon was not getting her period. Dr. Hergott
    identified post-pill suppression, which can last for a number of months following
    discontinuation of the birth control pill. Mrs. Bovingdon told him that her
    husband would be travelling a lot in the summer and that she was hoping to
    have her periods regulated before he went away. Dr. Hergott told her to chart
    her temperature for two months and if she was still not ovulating at that
    time, they would talk about Clomid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Bovingdon had her next appointment with Dr. Hergott on March 4, 1992. He
    looked at the temperature chart she had kept since January and observed that
    she was still not ovulating. He prescribed two drugs: Provera to start her
    periods and Clomid to induce ovulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Bovingdon said that Dr. Hergott did not discuss with her the risks of taking
    Clomid, namely the increased risk of having twins and the potential for premature
    birth when carrying twins, nor the risks associated with premature birth,
    such as cerebral palsy. She had a clear recollection that as he walked her
    to the door, Dr. Hergott told her with respect to Clomid that “you’re on
    such a low dose, you’ll never get pregnant with twins on a dose that low.” She
    understood that he was telling her not to be concerned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hergott did not have a specific recollection of what he told Mrs. Bovingdon
    about Clomid nor did he note it in her chart. However, he testified as to
    his usual practice when advising patients about Clomid and prescribing it.
    He would hand them a two-sided leaflet from the manufacturer which stated
    that nearly 10 per cent of pregnancies induced by Clomid produce twins, but
    he would tell them that based on his and his colleagues’
    experience, the risk of twins for patients who take Clomid was in the 3 to
    5 per cent range. He would also say that the higher risk reported by the
    manufacturer was based on higher doses prescribed in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    , but that he gave the lower dose, which resulted in a lower risk of twins.
    He denied that he told her that on the lower dose, she would never get pregnant
    with twins. He would not have said that, both because Clomid increased the
    risk of twins and because anyone could have twins without taking a fertility
    drug. He also said that he did tell his patients that twins carry the risk
    of prematurity and of the babies being smaller.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Mrs. Bovingdon specifically denied that Dr. Hergott showed
    her the leaflet that stated that 10 per cent of Clomid-induced pregnancies
    resulted in twins or that he said that his experience of twinning with Clomid
    was 3 to 5 per cent. She stated: “If I had known any risks at all were adding
    to my prematurity problem, I told you, I never would have gone on it.” And
    in re-examination she was even clearer, telling her own lawyer that she never
    would have taken Clomid had she known of the increased risks of having twins,
    and it would have made no difference whether she had been told that the risk
    was 3&nbsp;per cent, 5 per cent, or 10 per cent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Bovingdon became pregnant with the twins in May 1992 and they were born prematurely
    in December with severe disabilities. The trial judge told the jury on the
    issue of causation of the damage that it was accepted that the Clomid caused
    Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon to become pregnant with twins, the twin pregnancy caused
    or materially contributed to the premature birth, and the premature birth
    caused the damage to the twins.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was expert evidence at trial that it would be negligent for a doctor to tell
    a patient that in his opinion there was a 3 to 5 per cent risk of having
    twins with Clomid or that a lower dose would decrease the risk, when the
    manufacturer of the drug said the risk was 10 per cent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Question 1:    Have the plaintiffs satisfied you

    risks of taking Clomid to Carolyn Bovingdon in 1992, before she became pregnant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        If your answer is Yes, in what respects

    Hergott misled Mrs. Bovingdon by telling her that the risk of twins was in
    his clinical experience 3–5 % when the brochure said the risk was 10 %.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Question 2:    Has Carolyn Bovingdon satisfied

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues on the Appeal</span></h4>
  <p>(1)       Must the jury verdict on the issue of whether the appellant’s
    negligence caused Mrs. Bovingdon to take the Clomid be set aside as unreasonable
    and contrary to the evidence?</p>
  <p>(2)       Did the trial judge err in finding that the infants’ claims did
    not constitute claims for “wrongful life”? If their claims are properly characterized
    as claims for “wrongful life”, is there a cause of action in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario for “wrongful life”?</p>
  <p>(3)       Did the trial judge err in finding that the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <i>Krangle v. Brisco</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 477, does not preclude
    an Ontario court from ordering a defendant to pay damages to the parents
    of a disabled child for expenses to be incurred after the child is 18 years
    of age?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue 1:  Is the jury’s verdict on whether it was the appellant’s
      negligence that caused Mrs. Bovingdon to take Clomid unreasonable?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the jury’s verdict, the appellant made a motion to the trial judge for an
    order dismissing the action on the basis that the verdict on the issue of
    causation was “perverse,” the historical terminology for a verdict that is
    unreasonable as contrary to the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argued then, as he does on the appeal, that the jury’s answers
    are inconsistent with each other and with the evidence. The jury found that
    Dr. Hergott’s  negligence consisted of misleading Mrs. Bovingdon by telling
    her that the risk of twins with Clomid was 3 to 5 per cent when it was really
    10 per cent. Her evidence was that he did not tell her about any increased
    risk and that she would not have taken the Clomid had she known it would
    increase the risk of twins by any amount, whether it was 3, 5, or 10 per
    cent. However, she did take the Clomid, even though, according to the jury,
    Dr. Hergott told her there was a 3 to 5 per cent increased risk of having
    twins. As a result, the jury’s answer that Dr. Hergott’s negligent advice
    caused her to take the Clomid was inconsistent with their finding of negligence;
    consequently, their verdict on causation was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s submission. She reasoned that, because
    a jury is “free to accept or reject part of a witness’s evidence”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Despite the witness’s evidence, this jury could
    have concluded that [Mrs. Bovingdon] would have accepted the smaller risk,
    but not the greater. The jury had the benefit of hearing of her history and
    circumstances, and could balance [her] desire to get pregnant with her caution
    arising from her past negative circumstances.</p>

    standard for appellate review of a jury verdict is a very high one. It was
    articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1937 in <i>McCannell v. McLean</i>,
    [1937] S.C.R. 341 at 343, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as
    against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust
    as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
    acting judicially could have reached it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    it is relatively rare for a jury verdict in a civil case to be overturned
    on appeal.  However, there are cases where an appellate court is obliged
    to determine that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and unjust, based on
    the evidence and their findings. The appellant argues that because of the
    clear inconsistency between the jury’s finding that the doctor told Mrs.
    Bovingdon about a small risk, and her evidence that she would not have accepted
    any risk, their finding that his negligence caused her to take the Clomid
    makes this one of those rare cases where the jury’s verdict must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the jury accepted his evidence that he told Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon
    that in his experience, the risk of having twins after taking Clomid was
    between 3 to 5 per cent. Therefore, they could not have accepted her evidence
    that he never told her that, nor her evidence that he told her that the dose
    he was giving her was so small that she would never get pregnant with twins.
    Furthermore, Mrs. Bovingdon testified that had she been told of any degree
    of risk, she would not have taken the Clomid. Because the jury found that
    she was told of a 3 to 5 per cent risk of conceiving twins with Clomid, and
    she did take the Clomid, on their finding, she took it in spite of being
    told of the 3 to 5 per cent risk of twins. Therefore, they must have disbelieved
    her statement that she would not have taken Clomid had she known there was
    any degree of risk. Consequently, one must conclude that the jury’s answers
    to the questions were inconsistent with their own view of the evidence, and
    their verdict is therefore unreasonable and unjust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents say that the jury’s verdict was not unreasonable and was supported
    by the evidence. They make two arguments. The first is in accord with the
    approach taken by the trial judge, that the jury was entitled to accept part
    of Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon’s evidence and reject other parts. Therefore, they
    could have accepted that she would not have taken Clomid had she been told
    that the risk of having twins was 10 per cent, but rejected her evidence
    that she would not have taken the Clomid had she known that the risk was
    3 to 5 per cent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    approach, however, constitutes an error in law. In <i>Vancouver-Fraser Park
    District v. Olmstead</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 831, the Supreme Court confirmed
    the <i>McCannell </i>test for reviewing a jury verdict, and clarified an
    important issue concerning how a jury is entitled to view and assess a plaintiff’s
    evidence. The court stated that because the jury has the right to choose
    to accept only part of a witness’s evidence, the jury is entitled to discard
    the plaintiff’s own evidence where there is other evidence that is at variance
    with it. What the jury is not entitled to do is find in favour of the plaintiff
    by rejecting the plaintiff’s own evidence on issues that only the plaintiff
    could know, such as in that case, whether he was confused about a situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the respondents argue that the jury was entitled to take the view
    that  Mrs. Bovingdon was overstating her position when she said she was not
    prepared to accept any risk of twins, that they could reject her evidence
    to that effect and substitute their own conclusion based on their assessment
    of her character that her true position was that she would accept a small
    risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    a jury is not entitled to make positive findings in favour of a plaintiff
    based on rejecting the evidence of that plaintiff. A plaintiff’s case based
    on what she thought, felt, believed or did cannot improve by the jury rejecting
    her own evidence on those issues. That is clearly beyond the powers of a
    jury. A jury is obliged to act only on evidence that it hears and inferences
    properly drawn from such evidence; they are not entitled to speculate and
    make findings that are contrary to the evidence. Therefore, if the jury’s
    verdict was based on rejecting Mrs. Bovingdon’s evidence that she would not
    have taken Clomid had she known it carried a 3 to 5 per cent risk of conceiving
    twins, and substituting their own view that she was prepared to accept that
    level of risk, it must be set aside as unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the respondents make a second argument for upholding the jury’s verdict and
    reconciling its answers. The respondents’
    second argument is that there was evidence from Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon that
    was not specifically rejected by the jury that provides support for its verdict.
    That evidence was that she understood that she had no risk of twins from
    taking Clomid. While the jury found that Dr. Hergott told Mrs. Bovingdon
    that the risk of twins with Clomid was 3 to 5 per cent, he did it in the
    context of minimizing the risk. In cross-examination, he was asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        My question to you sir: Were you trying
    to minimize the risk of twinning, sir, by telling her, look, it’s not really
    10 percent, it’s really more like 3 and 5? That’s what you were trying to
    do, isn’t it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        In my experience, the risk was not near
    10 percent, and…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
    effective minimizing of the risk is consistent with Mrs. Bovingdon’s understanding
    that he was not concerned about the risk of her having twins with Clomid,
    and that he would have been concerned if there was such a risk, because he
    had told her in January that he could not get her through a pregnancy with
    twins. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury could have accepted that he told her about the small percentage of risk
    with Clomid, but also that she would not have twins on the low dose he was
    giving her —or at least that it was her understanding that she would not
    have twins on the low dose— and it was on that basis that she proceeded to
    take the Clomid. Mrs. Bovingdon’s recollection that Dr Hergott discussed
    the fact that she was getting a low dose was corroborated by Dr. Hergott’s
    evidence that he would have told her that she was getting a low dose compared
    to the dosage given to patients in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    submission must also be considered in the context of the trial judge’s charge
    to the jury, which was not only delivered orally, but which they appear to
    have had with them in written form in the jury room. In that charge, the
    trial judge set out for the jury the positions of the parties on each of
    the questions they had to answer. Her instructions to them on the plaintiffs’ and
    defendant’s positions on question #1 were as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff’s position is that your answer to
    this question should be “yes.” Mrs. Bovingdon remembers her conversation
    with Dr. Hergott, while he does not. Dr. Hergott did not make any note in
    the chart that he discussed the risks of taking Clomid with her, and you
    should therefore infer that he did not do so, especially since he did note
    in the chart a conversation about twins after she became pregnant. <i>Dr.&nbsp;Hergott
    misled Mrs. Bovingdon by telling her that the risk of twins was in his clinical
    experience 3–5% when the brochure said the risk was 10 %. Telling her the
    higher figure was based on American studies using higher doses of Clomid
    would have left her with the impression she was on a low dose. </i>Dr. Hergott’s
    evidence about his usual practice is not strong enough to support the inference
    that he followed his usual practice in this case. The plaintiff submits that
    the defendant was negligent in misstating the risks of Clomid, of failing
    to advise her of the option of waiting and further that if twins were conceived,
    there was a 50% chance of prematurity. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant’s position is that Mrs. Bovingdon
    knew all she needed to know to make a decision whether to take Clomid. She
    agreed she knew those matters that all the experts said she needed to know.
    The defendant says it is unlikely that Dr.&nbsp;Hergott told her that on
    a “dose that low she would never get pregnant with twins”, as that makes
    no sense in light of what was commonly known by gynaecologists at the time,
    and he would never have sent her for any early ultrasound if he had not suspected
    that Clomid might have caused twins. Dr. Hergott testified that his usual
    practice whenever he prescribed Clomid was to give the patient the brochure
    and point out the estimated increased risk of twins at 10 % and to also point
    out that in his clinical experience the risk was more in the area of 3–5
    %. Doctors can and do vary in the way they explain risks to a patient, but
    that does not mean that they breach the standard of care. Carolyn Bovingdon
    always had the option of waiting to take Clomid but decided to take it after
    being advised of the added risks. The defendant’s position is that your answer
    to question one should be “no.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears that the jury accepted what the judge told them was the plaintiff’s
    position on question #1, even though the 3 to 5 per cent risk of twins was
    not consistent, when taken literally, with her evidence that if she had been
    told there was any risk, she would not have taken the Clomid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the respondents’ second approach is available on the record and
    is sufficient to support the jury’s verdict. It was open to the jury to infer
    from Mrs.&nbsp;Bovingdon’s evidence, taken together with the fact that they
    accepted that Dr.&nbsp;Hergott told her that the risk of twins with Clomid
    was 3 to 5 per cent, that she understood that he was minimizing that risk
    down to zero. That is, the jury was entitled to find that she understood
    that she was on such a low dose that she would not conceive twins and he
    was not concerned about the risk, and that had she understood that there
    was a real risk of conceiving twins with Clomid, she would not have taken
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on this view of the evidence, I conclude that the jury’s verdict was not
    so plainly unreasonable or unjust that no jury reviewing the evidence as
    a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. I would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not challenge the right of the mother to sue him for damages
    for the “wrongful birth” of the children, if he was found to be negligent
    and in breach of the duty of care he owed to her. However, he challenged
    the right of the twins to claim damages from him to compensate them for being
    born, that is, for “wrongful life”. He raised this issue twice with the trial
    judge, once before the trial began with the jury and again following receipt
    of the jury’s verdict. Before the trial, the appellant moved under Rule 21
    of the Rules of Civil Procedure for a ruling that, as a matter of law, it
    was plain and obvious that the claim by the children was a claim for “wrongful
    life,” which courts in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    have rejected as untenable. Following the verdict, the appellant again asked
    the trial judge to dismiss the children’s claims as disclosing no cause of
    action. The trial judge ruled that the children had a valid claim against
    the appellant and that their claim was not a claim for “wrongful life.” </p>

    the key question is, if a child would not have been born at all without the
    doctor’s negligence, can such a child sue the doctor for the value of the
    difference between a life burdened with physical or mental defects and no
    life at all? How can the child be compensated for being born? How can a court
    give damages that measure the value of no life versus a damaged life? And
    from a metaphysical point of view, does it make sense to allow such an action,
    given that if the child had not been born, he or she would not have been
    able to bring the action at all?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    courts, such as the English Court of Appeal in <i>McKay v.</i> <i>Essex Area
    Health Authority</i>, [1982] 1 QB 1166, originally rejected wrongful life
    claims on the basis that attempting to compensate a person for being alive
    is contrary to public policy. However, in other jurisdictions, particularly
    some American states, courts have concluded that abstract philosophical difficulties
    cannot justify denying compensation to a child born with disabilities in
    part because of a doctor’s negligence, and whose survival and support will
    require significant funds throughout his or her life. See, for example, <i>Turpin
    v. Sortini</i>, 31

    have continued to encounter and to struggle with the issue in different types
    of fact situations, they have sought to narrow the class of claims for which
    there can be no recovery by a child born injured or disabled where there
    has been medical negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    leading Canadian case on the issue is the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision
    in <i>Lacroix (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dominique</i> (2000), 202 D.L.R.
    (4th) 121, where the court divided children’s claims into two categories,
    one that allows a valid claim against a doctor, the other that does not.
    Only in the first category, where the doctor’s negligence caused the damage
    to the child, will the doctor be liable to the child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Lacroix,</i> before
    trying to conceive a child, a mother with epilepsy consulted her doctor about
    the possible effects of her epilepsy medication on a foetus. The trial judge
    accepted the parents’ evidence that the doctor did not warn them about the
    risks, and that had they been warned, they would not have had children. Although
    their first child was unaffected, their second child suffered from retardation
    caused by the epilepsy drug. Subject to a limitation defence, the parents
    had a claim against the doctor for damages for “wrongful birth”. Because
    of the doctor’s negligence in failing to advise them about the risks of the
    drug harming an unborn child, the parents conceived and the mother bore the
    second child. The doctor breached his duty to the parents causing them to
    suffer damage. The parents could be compensated for the cost associated with
    the care and treatment of the disabled child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the child’s claim, the Manitoba Court of Appeal divided cases where a
    child is born with disabilities into two categories:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (i)      cases in which the abnormalities have
    been caused by the wrongful act or omission of another; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (ii)     cases in which, but for the wrongful
    act or omission, the child would not have been born at all. (para. 24)</p>

    cases in the first category, where the defendant’s wrongful act caused the
    harm, the child has a valid claim. However, in cases in the second category,
    where the defendant’s negligence did not cause the harm to the child but
    only caused the parents either to proceed to conceive the child, or to bear
    the child rather than abort, that is an action for wrongful life for which
    there is no claim in law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    an example of the first category, the court referred to the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal decision in <i>Cherry (Guardian Ad Litem) v. Borsman</i> (1992),
    94 D.L.R. (4th) 487. There the doctor negligently injured the foetus while
    unsuccessfully attempting to perform an abortion. The trial judge found that
    the doctor owed a duty of care to the mother to perform the abortion with
    due care, but he also owed a duty to the infant not to injure her in the
    process. Of course, an unborn child has no legal rights. However, upon live
    birth the child can assert a claim for injury suffered before birth: see <i>Dehler
    v. Ottawa Civic Hospital</i> (1979), 101 D.L.R. (3d) 686, 695–97 (Ont. H.C.J.),

    the doctor argued in the court of appeal that a dual duty in the case of
    an abortion would put him in an impossible conflict of interest position:
    his duty to the mother was to abort the child, while the duty to the child
    was not to harm her. He said that because his duty was to his patient, the
    mother, he could have no legal proximity to the child. The court disagreed
    and stated at page 504:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We think the law would be wanting and badly flawed
    if it found itself in the position of having to deny any remedy to this infant
    plaintiff because of what at first glance may appear to be established principles
    of negligence. In our opinion the principles of negligence do not stand in
    the way of recovery for this plaintiff. We think that a surgeon on performing
    an abortion in a case such as this owes a duty of care to the mother to perform
    his task properly but at the same time owes a duty of care to the foetus
    not to harm it if he should fail in meeting the duty of care he owes to the
    mother.</p>

    identified its decision in <i>Webster v. Chapman</i>, [1998] 4 W.W.R. 335,
    as another example of a case in the first category. In <i>Webster</i>, the
    mother had been prescribed the drug Coumadin to treat pelvic thrombosis.
    The doctor allowed her to remain on the drug once he knew she was pregnant,
    and he failed to consult a specialist to obtain advice about the effect of
    the drug on a foetus. The drug should have been discontinued immediately.
    It caused the child to be born with congenital injuries. In <i>Webster,</i> the
    doctor was held liable to the infant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases
    in the second category typically arise when a doctor fails to warn the mother
    about the risk of giving birth to a child with disabilities. For example,
    where there are factors such as the risk of serious hereditary diseases,
    parents who are warned may decide not to conceive, or where parents are advised
    of an adverse genetic test result or an <i>in utero </i>infection such as
    rubella, they may choose to abort. In those cases, the doctor’s negligence
    has not caused the injury. Rather, it has caused or allowed the child to
    be born, because had the parents been informed of the risk, they would have
    refrained from conception or discontinued the pregnancy. See, for example, <i>Mickle
    v. Salvation Army Grace Hospital</i> (1998), 166 D.L.R. (4th) 743 (Ont. Gen.
    Div.) (failure to detect congenital limb deformities in foetus during ultrasound
    examination); <i>Jones (Guardian ad litem of) v. Rostvig</i> (1999),<i> </i>44
    C.C.L.T. (2d) 313 (B.C.S.C.) (failure to prescribe amniocentesis and other

    to diagnose <i>in utero </i>rubella); <i>Becker v. Schwartz</i>, 386 N.E.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this second category of cases, the child’s claim is not for the harm but
    for being born (with a disability). This claim has been labelled “wrongful
    life”. The <i>Lacroix </i>court agreed with courts in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    that a claim for wrongful life should not be recognized: see <i>Lacroix</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    para. 31, citing <i>Mickle</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Jones</i>, <i>supra</i>;<i> Arndt
    v. Smith</i>, [1994] 8 W.W.R. 568 (B.C.S.C.) (rev’d on other grounds, [1997]
    2 S.C.R. 539); <i>McKay</i>, <i>supra</i>. The Manitoba Court of Appeal was
    persuaded by the <i>McKay </i>court’s two rationales: first, that it is impossible
    to calculate a claim for damages that requires a court to quantify the value
    of a lost opportunity for non-existence; and second, that a doctor could
    not owe a duty to a child to give its mother the opportunity to terminate
    its life.</p>

    classified infants’ claims into two categories, the Manitoba Court of Appeal
    had to decide into which category the <i>Lacroix</i> case fell. The problem
    was that on the facts, the case could arguably fall into either category.
    Because it was the epilepsy drug that caused the harm to the child, on one
    analysis the doctor’s negligence caused the harm because he prescribed the
    drug without warning the parents about its risks. However, the doctor’s negligent
    act did not consist in prescribing the drug, but rather in failing to advise
    the mother of the risks of getting pregnant while on it.  The evidence was
    that had she been warned of the risks, the mother would have continued taking
    the drug, which she needed, but she would have avoided pregnancy. The court
    recognized that the doctor owed the mother a duty to prescribe the epilepsy
    medication she needed. Furthermore, the risk to a foetus of the mother suffering
    a seizure while pregnant was greater than the risk of damage that the drug
    posed to the foetus. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court concluded that in this situation, unlike in <i>Cherry</i>, to impose
    on the doctor a duty of care to the child would create a conflict with the
    doctor’s duty to the mother to prescribe a drug that she needed, stating
    at para. 40: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>it is impossible, in my view, to hold that the
    doctor owed a duty to the future child not to prescribe a medication for
    the mother which, though potentially harmful to the child, was required both
    for the mother’s health and to avoid the risk to a fetus of the mother having
    a seizure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court therefore held that the case fell into the second category: but for
    the doctor’s negligence in failing to warn the mother of the risks, the child
    would not have been born. The negligence was not in prescribing the drug,
    but in failing to provide the information that the drug was contraindicated
    if the mother were to become pregnant. Because the case fell into the second
    category, the court held that it was a case of “wrongful life” and there
    was no cause of action. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing Dr. Hergott’s argument that the twins had no cause of action against
    him for wrongful life, the trial judge addressed the issue based on the two
    categories in <i>Lacroix</i>. Was this a case where the damage to the children
    was caused by the doctor’s negligence, or was it a case where the doctor’s
    negligence did not cause the damage but caused or permitted the children
    to be born? To decide the question, the trial judge focused on the causation
    concession that the appellant had made for the jury—that the Clomid caused
    the twinning, the twinning caused the prematurity, and the prematurity caused
    the damage to the children. She reasoned that, therefore, the Clomid caused
    the damage and since the doctor had prescribed the Clomid without warning
    the mother of the risks, the doctor had thereby caused the harm to the children.
    She concluded that the case was a category one case, and therefore not an
    action for wrongful life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    coming to this conclusion, the trial judge had to distinguish the result
    in <i>Lacroix</i>. She was satisfied that the facts in this case distinguished
    it from <i>Lacroix </i>because there the mother required the medication for
    her epilepsy. Furthermore, she stated that <i>Lacroix </i>should be narrowly
    interpreted. The <i>Lacroix </i>court had agreed with <i>McKay</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>that
    wrongful life claims should be barred on policy grounds. The trial judge
    disagreed with the English Court of Appeal’s policy concern in <i>McKay</i> that
    if such claims were not barred, physicians would be encouraged to recommend
    abortion in order to avoid the risk that a child might be born impaired and
    that they would thereby be found liable for negligence. She rejected this
    concern as unfounded, because a woman has the autonomous right to make her
    own decision about abortion. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clearly very difficult to articulate a coherent theory of liability of
    a doctor to an unborn child that is based on a valid legal structure and
    satisfactorily addresses all the policy concerns that have troubled the courts
    and academics that have previously considered this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, the whole concept of paying compensation to someone born disabled
    or to their parents is seen by some of those who advocate for the disabled
    as a negative development that reinforces stereotypical reactions to persons
    with disabilities. In her article, “The Disabling Impact of Wrongful Birth
    and Wrongful Life Actions” (2005) 40 Harv. C.R.-C.L.L. Rev. 141 at 195, Professor
    Wendy F. Hensel concludes that “[o]nly by viewing wrongful birth and life
    actions as a collective threat facing all individuals with disabilities can
    tort law avoid endorsing such disabling and disturbing messages.” In contrast,
    other academics and courts take the view that where a child is born with
    damage resulting from medical negligence, the courts should not be concerned
    with the conceptual difficulties presented by the “non-existence”
    issue or with offending those who speak on behalf of persons with disabilities,
    but should instead focus on achieving full compensation to the family through
    permitting a combination of actions by the parents and the child: see Dean
    Stretton, “The Birth Torts: Damages for Wrongful Birth and Wrongful Life” [2005]
    Deakin Law Review 16 (Australia).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not believe that the two-category approach in <i>Lacroix</i> provides
    a coherent theory that can assist courts in making the difficult decision
    of when a child should be able to recover damages from a doctor for being
    born with disabilities. The facts in <i>Lacroix</i> demonstrate the problem. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second category is fairly clear. It only includes cases where the damage
    to the child was not caused in any way by the doctor’s negligence. The doctor’s
    failure in these cases consists of improperly performing tests or failing
    to advise parents of the availability or the results of the tests, thereby
    preventing the parents from choosing to avoid conceiving a child who could
    be born with disabilities or the mother from terminating a pregnancy where
    damage has already occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases
    in the first category, however, are much more difficult to compartmentalize.
    In those cases, the doctor may have caused or contributed to the damage by
    prescribing a contraindicated drug or by physically damaging the foetus <i>in
    utero</i>. Yet, as in <i>Cherry</i>, the doctor’s negligence could also have
    caused or allowed the child to be born.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    was exactly what occurred in <i>Lacroix</i>. The doctor’s negligence caused
    the damage and the birth. However, the court effectively overlooked the damage
    and placed the case in category two. In my view, with respect, <i>Lacroix</i> fits
    much more easily into category one than does the case at bar. In <i>Lacroix</i>,
    the epilepsy drug actually harmed the child. In this case, the Clomid had
    no pharmacological effect on the children. Dr. Hergott did not cause the
    damage to the children. Rather, by failing to give Mrs. Bovingdon all the
    information she needed to decide whether to take the drug to augment her
    fertility, he caused or contributed to the birth of the twins. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the Clomid was the first step in the chain of causation that led to the damage,
    the appellant’s negligence did not cause the damage. This was because prescribing
    Clomid to Mrs. Bovingdon was not contraindicated and was not in itself a
    negligent act. The preponderance of expert evidence at trial established
    that prescribing Clomid to a woman in Mrs. Bovingdon’s circumstances met
    the standard of care, as long as Mrs. Bovingdon understood the risks of twinning,
    prematurity, and consequent possible damage. It was her choice to make, although
    it had to be an informed choice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, because the doctor did not cause the harm to the twins, the trial
    judge erred by finding that this case fell into the first category rather
    than the second category described by <i>Lacroix.</i> The fact that the mother
    in <i>Lacroix</i> needed the epilepsy drug does not change the analysis,
    nor does it distinguish the two cases, especially because the epilepsy drug
    actually harmed the child in <i>Lacroix</i>. Both cases involved giving the
    mother full information so that she could choose the course of action she
    wished to take.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Duty of Care</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I stated above, I do not find the two categories described in <i>Lacroix </i>particularly
    useful as a basis for analyzing these claims.  I prefer to approach the issue
    not by using categories such as those set down by <i>Lacroix</i>, but rather
    through the normal analysis of tort liability: duty of care, standard of
    care, breach, and damage. The real question in each case is, did the doctor
    owe a duty of care to the future child or children under the circumstances?  If
    so, then it becomes appropriate to consider the standard of care, whether
    the doctor breached the duty, and the correct measure of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that the doctor owed the same duty to the future children
    that he owed to the mother—the duty to properly inform their mother of the
    risks associated with Clomid prior to prescribing it to her while she was
    trying to become pregnant. In their factum, the respondents say that the
    children’s “right was to have a drug-free conception, with a reduced risk
    of disability, rather than a right not to be born.” The trial judge also
    characterized the appellant as owing a duty to the foetus that is co-extensive
    with his duty to the mother, even though he could not have disclosed risks
    to a foetus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when one analyzes this characterization of the duty, it becomes apparent
    that it does not bear scrutiny. Mrs. Bovingdon came to the appellant in 1992
    because she and her new husband wanted to have children, but she could not
    become pregnant because she was not ovulating. She was also concerned about
    having a premature birth because she had previously had a miscarriage and
    a premature pregnancy. The appellant’s duty to his patient, the mother, was
    to help her to become pregnant if possible and to provide her with all the
    information she needed to decide whether to take fertility medication to
    assist with the process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    once she had the information, it was entirely her choice whether to take
    the Clomid. She was not obliged to act in the best interests of a future
    child or children or to make the choice they would want. She was not acting
    as their surrogate making a choice on their behalf. She was entitled to choose
    to take the risk of having twins. This is similar to a mother’s right to
    choose whether to have an abortion. That is why the Supreme Court protected
    mothers from any tort liability to an unborn child: see <i>Dobson v. Dobson</i>,
    [1999] 2 S.C.R. 753. As Cory J. stated on behalf of the majority in <i>Dobson</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t is the policy concerns, so central to this
    issue, which should determine whether tort liability should be imposed on
    mothers for prenatal negligence. With the greatest respect … the judgments
    below failed to appreciate fully the extensive intrusion into the privacy
    and autonomy rights of women that would be required by the imposition of
    tort liability on mothers for prenatal negligence. Such a rule of law would
    have profound implications and consequences for all Canadian women who are
    or may become pregnant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    right of a mother to choose whether to take Clomid is consistent with the
    standard of care imposed on the doctor in this case, which was to provide
    the information his patient needed to make an informed choice, rather than
    to make the choice for her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    was the mother obliged to make the choice that a hypothetical reasonable
    person would have made. One of the questions the jury is asked to answer
    in an action against a doctor for failing to provide the information required
    for informed consent is whether a reasonable person would have made the choice
    the plaintiff claims he or she would have made with the benefit of full information.
    In <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880, (confirmed in <i>Arndt v.
    Smith</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539), the Supreme Court held that a court is required
    to apply a modified objective test of the plaintiff’s intent in an action
    against a doctor for failure to provide informed consent. Its purpose is
    to test the subjective assertion of the plaintiff, made after the fact, that
    she would have made a different choice had she been properly informed. Therefore,
    when a jury finds, as it did in this case, that a reasonable person would
    not have taken the drug if properly advised, that finding merely applies
    the modified objective test, and in effect affirms the reasonableness of
    the plaintiff’s evidence concerning what she says she would have done if
    she had been appropriately informed. It is not a finding that the only reasonable
    choice the plaintiff could have made if properly informed would have been
    to refuse the drug.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, the evidence in this case was that most women do elect to take Clomid
    when fully informed. When the Bovingdons learned that Mrs. Bovingdon was
    pregnant with twins, Dr. Hergott reassured her and discussed how she should
    take special precautions during her pregnancy including rest in order to
    bear the twins as safely as possible. There was no issue in this case of
    abortion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the doctor’s duty with this type of drug is only to provide information sufficient
    to allow the mother to make an informed choice, it cannot be said that the
    children have a right to a drug-free birth. Nor can the doctor owe a duty
    to the children that is co-extensive with his duty to the mother. To frame
    the duty in that way is to overlook the fact, as discussed above, that the
    choice is the mother’s; she is entitled to choose to take the drug and risk
    conceiving twins without considering their interests. If she does, the children
    have no complaint against her or the doctor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, where a drug is contraindicated for a pregnant woman, the standard
    of care for the doctor may be either not to prescribe the drug or to ensure
    that the woman is taking all appropriate precautions to prevent pregnancy.
    That was the standard in <i>Paxton v. Ramji</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1179 (S.C.J.),
    where Accutane could be prescribed for acne, but if the patient was a woman,
    then only if she was not going to become pregnant.<a href="#_ftn3"

    conclude that in this case, the appellant had no duty of care to the future
    children not to cause them harm in prescribing Clomid to the mother. The
    doctor owed a duty of care only to the mother, which duty consisted of ensuring
    that she possessed knowledge sufficient to make an informed decision whether
    to take Clomid. This knowledge included the increased risk of conceiving
    twins arising from the drug, the increased potential for premature birth
    in a twin pregnancy, and the possible harm to the children that could result
    from premature birth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also believe that a policy analysis supports the conclusion that where the
    standard of care requires a doctor to give a woman the information to make
    an informed decision about taking a drug or undergoing a procedure, the doctor
    cannot owe a co-extensive duty to a future child. Where the standard of care
    on the doctor is to ensure that the mother’s decision is an informed one,
    a co-extensive duty of care to a future child would create a potential conflict
    of interest with the duty to the mother. If future children have a right
    to a drug-free birth, as the respondents suggest, then doctors might decide
    to deny women the choice of taking Clomid on the basis that providing such
    choice might be a breach of the doctor’s duty to the unborn children. In
    my view, the policy of ensuring that women’s choice of treatment be preserved
    supports the conclusion that the doctor owed no legal duty to the unborn
    children in this case.<a href="#_ftn4"

    in this case is narrowly framed based on a finding that there was no duty
    of care owed to the future children and not on whether the claim is properly
    categorized as a claim for “wrongful life”. Because I have concluded that
    there was no duty of care and therefore no cause of action by the twins,
    it is not necessary for me to decide whether and in what circumstances the
    courts of this province may recognize a cause of action for
    “wrongful life.” </p>

    I have concluded, contrary to the finding of the trial judge, that the children’s
    claim against the doctor would have fallen into the category of claims that
    the <i>Lacroix </i>court designated as “wrongful life,” I do not believe
    that the categories described in that decision are comprehensive or distinctive
    enough to be used as the mechanism for determining whether a cause of action
    exists. Furthermore, it is undecided whether the courts of this province
    would necessarily dismiss every claim for “wrongful life”.  A proper consideration
    of this question would require the court to address the policy issue of whether
    such claims should exist in our law. In this case, the issue is obviated
    because I have found that although the doctor breached his duty of care to
    the mother to give her full information to allow her to make an informed
    decision whether to take Clomid, he owed no duty of care to the unborn children
    when prescribing Clomid to a woman who wished to become pregnant. </p>

    of the debate about whether, as a matter of public policy, the courts should
    recognize a claim by children for wrongful life is actuated by the problem
    that in some jurisdictions the parents can recover damages for wrongful birth,
    including the cost of special care needs of the children, but only until
    the age of majority. After that, only the child can make the claim. If parents
    are able to care for the disabled child beyond the age of majority and if
    a proper measure of damages in a parent’s wrongful birth claim may include
    the cost of caring for the child beyond the age of eighteen, such an award

    sued the doctor who had looked after the mother during her pregnancy for
    failing to advise the parents that there was a test that would have shown
    that their child would be born with the syndrome. Had the mother learned
    this information, she would have had an abortion. It was agreed that the
    doctor was at fault. It was also conceded that the child himself had no cause
    of action. The parents were awarded the costs of caring for the child up
    to age nineteen, including the cost of in-home services, special education,
    speech therapy and equipment. The narrow issue was whether the parents were
    entitled to recover as part of their damage award, the same costs of caring
    for the child once he reached the age of majority.</p>

    child once he turned nineteen. It was agreed that at that age, it would be
    in the child’s best interests for him to move into a publicly funded adult
    group home. However, the trial judge did make a contingency award of $80,000
    to cover the 5 per cent chance that public benefits would no longer be available
    when the child reached nineteen. After the trial, the <i>Family Relations
    Act</i>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, ss. 87–100, was amended to provide that parents
    are responsible for supporting children, including adults over age nineteen,
    who are unable to withdraw from their parents’ charge or to obtain the necessities
    of life because of, <i>inter alia</i>, disability. As a result of this legislative
    change, the parents appealed the decision to the British Columbia Court of
    Appeal, based on the concern that the state might look to them in the future
    for reimbursement for the cost of the group home. The majority of the court

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court found that by living in a group home, the child would be independent
    of his parents and therefore out of their “charge”. As a result, the parents
    would still have no legal responsibility under the amended Act to support
    the child as an adult and therefore no obligation to reimburse the state
    for the cost of the group home. The court agreed with the trial judge that
    the parents therefore would not incur costs for the child’s adult care, subject
    to the 5 per cent contingency amount awarded to cover the possibility that
    the publicly funded group home would not be available in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argued at trial that the effect of the <i>Krangle </i>case is that
    the Bovingdons are not entitled to recover as part of their damages the cost
    of caring for the twins once they reach age eighteen in Ontario, because
    at that time the parents have no legal obligation to support the children.
    The trial judge rejected this submission. She interpreted <i>Krangle</i> as
    turning on its own facts and the application of the B.C. <i>Family Relations
    Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts in this case are quite different from those in <i>Krangle</i>. The
    twins are profoundly disabled, and although the parents will not be legally
    responsible for their support after age eighteen, they do not intend to place
    the twins in a group home. A group home could only provide for their physical
    care but not their emotional well-being. Nor would the group home be able
    to give them intellectual stimulation and pleasure. The parents’ assertion
    that it was in the children’s best interests to remain with them beyond age
    eighteen was not challenged at the trial. The costs the parents are claiming
    are for extraordinary expenses for nursing care, medications and supplies
    connected with the children’s disabilities for the balance of their lives,
    projected to be a further seventeen and forty-four years respectively, not
    for basic sustenance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s submission that <i>Krangle</i> stands
    for the proposition that the absence of a legal obligation on the parents
    to support the children after age eighteen is a bar to recovery. I agree
    with the trial judge. In <i>Krangle</i>,<i> </i>the child was not going to
    be supported by the parents once he was an adult. Therefore, they would not
    be incurring that cost. This was not because they were not entitled to incur
    the cost had they wished but because the group home was in the child’s best
    interest. The issue in that case was whether the parents would be obliged
    to reimburse the state for the cost of the child’s care, which turned on
    their legal obligation to provide support. If they had been responsible to
    reimburse the state, they would be seen as likely to incur the cost of future
    care and the court would have awarded damages to cover this cost.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the evidence is that the parents will be incurring the cost of
    the extraordinary expenses needed for the care of the twins for the rest
    of their lives. The trial judge was careful to ensure that the jury would
    not make an award that would give the parents any “double recovery” for amounts
    that they may be able to claim from the province for basic care costs for
    the twins in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the trial judge that according to <i>Krangle</i>, the parents
    were entitled to have the jury determine on the evidence what losses they
    would reasonably be likely to incur for the cost of the care of the twins
    beyond the age of majority, whether or not they were legally obliged to continue
    to care for the twins after that time, and to award those costs as part of
    their damages in this case. I would therefore dismiss the third ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Result</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would dismiss the appeal on issues 1 and 3 and allow the appeal
    on issue 2. The effect of this ruling, in accordance with the settlement
    agreement reached by the parties, is that the respondents will receive a
    further $3.5 million. As it was also part of the settlement agreement that
    neither side would seek costs of the appeal, there will be no order as to
    costs of the appeal.</p>

    the trial, the jury was also required to decide whether the action was barred
    by the passage of the limitation period. Although the twins were born in
    December, 1992, the action was not commenced until March 23, 2004. The jury
    was asked a fourth question dealing with the limitation period:</p>
