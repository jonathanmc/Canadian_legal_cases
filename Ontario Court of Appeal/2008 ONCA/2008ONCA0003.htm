    appellant sought to amend her statement of claim against the respondent for
    wrongful dismissal to allege that she had been constructively dismissed as
    a result of events that occurred well over a year before the events described
    in the claim. The motion judge refused to allow the amendments on the basis
    that they essentially advanced a new and unrelated claim and that this new
    claim was statute barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this appeal is the proper interpretation of rule 26.01 when a party
    seeks to amend a pleading after expiry of the relevant limitation period.
    More specifically, the issue is whether the loss of a limitation defence
    in and of itself gives rise to a presumption that the opposing party is prejudiced
    by the amendment and, if such a prejudice is presumed, what a moving party
    must demonstrate to rebut this presumption. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II. Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant, Melanie Frohlick, was an employee of the respondent, Pinkerton
      Canada Limited (“Pinkerton”), from 1990 until February 2001.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      1999, due to internal changes within Pinkerton, the appellant’s rate of
      remuneration was significantly decreased from $25 per hour to $15 per hour.
      Prior to this change the appellant’s income was approximately $45,000 per
      annum; it dropped to $26,676 per annum in 2000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      February 1, 2001, the respondent transferred the business for which the
      appellant worked to Securicor Canada Ltd. (“Securicor”). At that time,
      the appellant and other employees were told that they would continue their
      employment with Securicor, the new owner. As a result, they never received
      any notice, severance or payment in lieu of notice from the respondent.
      The appellant continued with Securicor but her duties and remuneration
      were substantially reduced despite the assurances to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      October 1, 2003, the appellant and three other employees issued the present
      claim. The statement of claim briefly sets out the events that transpired
      when the respondent transferred its business to Securicor in 2001 and alleges
      that the respondent breached the terms of the employment contract by dismissing
      or constructively dismissing these four employees without prior notice
      or payment in lieu of notice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      January 2006, the appellant changed counsel. New counsel sought to amend
      the claim to make reference to the significant salary reduction imposed
      on the appellant by the respondent in 1999 and to allege that this “dramatic
      reduction in her rate of remuneration and overall pay [by the respondent]
      constitutes constructive dismissal”. Counsel for the respondent refused
      to consent to the proposed amendments on the basis that the limitation
      period had expired.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>III. The Judgment Below</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion to amend was heard on November 2, 2006. After noting that rule 26.01
      is mandatory and that amendments to pleadings are to be granted except
      when the prejudice is such that the other party cannot be compensated for
      by costs or an adjournment, the motion judge concluded that the motion
      should nonetheless be dismissed. In his view, the amendments advance a
      new cause of action which is statute barred. The constructive dismissal
      claim as originally framed was concerned with the  2001 transfer to Securicor.
      The 1999 salary reduction which the appellant now sought to plead in support
      of the constructive dismissal claim is unrelated to the 2001 events and
      constitutes a separate and distinct cause of action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge noted that when a limitation period has expired and the moving
      party seeks to amend the statement of claim, the court will presume prejudice
      to the responding party. On the record before him, the motion judge found
      that the appellant had not rebutted this presumption. Further, even if
      the presumption of prejudice had been successfully rebutted, the motion
      judge was of the view that special circumstances had to be demonstrated
      before an amendment would be allowed. No special circumstances were shown
      to exist in this case. </span></p>

      26.01 reads as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>On motion at any stage of an action
      the court shall grant leave to amend a pleading on such terms as are just,
      unless prejudice would result that could not be compensated for by costs
      or an adjournment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is also helpful to consider rule 5.04(2), which deals with the addition,
      deletion or substitution of parties and uses the same language as rule
      26.01 with respect to prejudice. Rule 5.04(2) reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>At any stage of a proceeding the
      court may by order add, delete or substitute a party or correct the name
      of a party incorrectly named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice
      would result that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge correctly observed that the burden of showing prejudice that
      would militate against allowing the amendments rests with the responding
      party. The same can be said in a rule 5.04(2) application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both
      rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) have as a prerequisite that the proposed amendment
      or change in the parties must not give rise to prejudice that cannot be
      compensated by costs or an adjournment. However, rule 26.01 is mandatory
      as it provides that if the prerequisite is met the amendment “shall” be
      allowed. In contrast, the language of rule 5.04(2) is discretionary as
      it provides that if the prerequisite is met the relief sought “may” be
      granted. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      difference in wording has led to some confusion in the cases as to the
      interplay between prejudice and the mandatory nature of rule 26.01. In
      my view, the difference has no bearing on how a court is to address the
      issue of prejudice when a limitation period has expired. The mandatory
      nature of rule 26.01 only becomes important after the issue of prejudice
      has been dealt with. This will become clear in the discussion to follow. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:150%;

lang=EN-US>whether the loss of a limitation period defence gives rise to a presumption
      of prejudice and, if such a presumption exists, what is necessary to rebut
      it; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
150%;'><span
lang=EN-US>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>whether, in addition to rebutting the presumption of prejudice, the
      moving party must also show that special circumstances exist which justify
      the granting of leave. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the proper interpretation of rule 26.01 is that the expiry of
      a limitation period gives rise to a presumption of prejudice. This presumption
      of prejudice will be determinative unless the party seeking the amendment
      can show the existence of special circumstances that rebut the presumption. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      order to fully understand why the passing of a limitation period automatically
      gives rise to a presumption of prejudice, it is useful to examine the purposes
      behind limitation periods. In <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R.
      6 at paras. 21-24, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the underlying rationale
      for the limitations statutes as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There are three [purposes], and
      they may be described as the certainty, evidentiary, and diligence rationales.…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Statutes of limitations have long
      been said to be statutes of repose…
    The reasoning is straightforward enough. There comes a time, it is said,
    when a potential defendant should be secure in his reasonable expectation
    that he will not be held to account for ancient obligations….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The second rationale is evidentiary
      and concerns the desire to foreclose claims based on stale evidence. Once
      the limitation period has lapsed, the potential defendant should no longer
      be concerned about the preservation of evidence relevant to the claim….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Finally, plaintiffs are expected
      to act diligently and not “sleep on their rights”; statutes of limitation
      are an incentive for plaintiffs to bring suit in a timely fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition to these three purposes, the court must also consider the legislation
      establishing the limitation period as well as any statutory provision that
      might provide for extension of the limitation period. As appears from cases
      such as <i>Novak v. Bond</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 808, the way that the statutory
      limitation has been framed will often seek to balance the arbitrariness
      of a limitation period with the interests of the party seeking to overcome
      the limitation defence. As set out by the majority in <i>Novak</i> at para.&nbsp;66: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Contemporary limitations statutes thus seek to
    balance conventional rationales oriented towards the protection of the defendant – certainty,
    evidentiary, and diligence – with the need to treat plaintiffs fairly, having
    regard to their specific circumstances. As Major J. put it in <i>Murphy,
    supra</i>, “[a] limitations scheme must attempt to balance the interest of
    both sides”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    26.01 is an enactment that allows a court to relieve against the harshness
    of an expired limitation period in certain circumstances. It would be wrong,
    however, to view rule 26.01 as allowing a party to use the existence of an
    outstanding claim, and nothing more, to defeat the protection of relevant
    limitation periods. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following excerpt from the decision of <i>Deaville v. Boegeman </i>(1984),
    48 O.R. (2d) 725 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 730, conveys the correct perspective:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the expiry of the limitation period
    creates a presumption, however slight in some cases, of prejudice to the
    defendant…. If matters are left in balance, the usual rules apply and the
    applicant upon whom the burden lies has not discharged that burden.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    a limitation period has passed, there will be a presumption of prejudice
    that cannot be compensated for by costs or an adjournment. <span lang=EN-US>The
    moving party must demonstrate why, on the facts of the case, the court should
    not apply the normal rule that the presumption of prejudice flowing from
    the loss of the limitation period is determinative. This involves a consideration
    of special circumstances that would lead the court to conclude that the presumption
    of prejudice should not apply. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statute establishing the limitation period may itself provide for relief
    in certain circumstances. Absent a statutory basis for relieving against
    the harshness of a limitation period, the court, faced with a rule 26.01
    motion, will consider whether it would be unfair to allow the opposite party
    to rely on the limitation period given the relationship the proposed claim
    has to the existing and ongoing claim and the way that the action has progressed
    to date. The court will consider the true nature of all of the claims and
    the knowledge of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, rule 26.01 does not contemplate the addition of unrelated statute-barred
    claims by way of amendment to an existing statement of claim. Conceptually,
    this should be treated no differently than the issuance of a new and separate
    statement of claim that advances a statute-barred claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no exhaustive list of what constitutes special circumstances in the context
    of rule 26.01. They are often procedural or informational mistakes made by
    a party that have not misled the opposite party or induced the opposite party
    to defend the claim differently than it would have if the amendment had been
    made before the limitation period expired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that I view the concept of “special
    circumstances” as overlapping with the moving party’s burden to rebut the
    presumption of prejudice. Facts that indicate an absence of prejudice may
    also constitute special circumstances justifying leave to amend under the
    authority of rule 26.01.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Previous
    decisions of this court have undertaken the prejudice analysis under rules
    26.01 and 5.04(2) in a two step process: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>Mazzuca v. Silvercreek
    Pharmary Ltd</i>., [2001] O.J. No. 4567 (C.A.) and <i>Mota v. Hamilton</i>-<i>Wentworth
    (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board</i> (2003) 63 O.R. (3d) 737
    (C.A.). The first step considered the prejudice to the responding party other
    than might arise as a result of the loss of a limitation defence. The second
    considered whether special circumstances existed so as to justify relieving
    against the harshness of the expired limitation period. The integrated approach
    I have adopted is in substance consistent with these earlier decisions. It
    compresses the two stages into one by considering the prejudice suffered
    from the loss of a limitation defence and the existence of
    “special circumstances” as being encompassed in the “prejudice” analysis
    referred to in rules 26.01 and 5.04(2). This, in my view, logically emerges
    from the wording of rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) as they direct courts to consider
    the sole question of prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, therefore, the loss of a limitation defence gives rise to a presumption
    of prejudice. The moving party must show the existence of special circumstances
    that, in the context of the existing claim, rebut the presumption that the
    responding party will suffer prejudice from the loss of a limitation defence.</p>

      is only after the court has determined that there is no prejudice that
      cannot be compensated for by costs or an adjournment that the mandatory
      nature of rule 26.01 comes into play. The rule then provides that the motion
      judge “shall”
    grant the amendment sought. This can be contrasted with the permissive wording
    of rule 5.04(2), which grants the motion judge a residual discretion to deny
    the relief sought, even in the absence of the kind of prejudice contemplated
    by the rules. In exercising this residual discretion under rule 5.04 the
    court may once again consider special circumstances.</span></p>

    the case at bar, there is no dispute that the applicable limitation period
    has expired. It is also apparent that the amendment the appellant seeks to
    make constitutes a fundamentally different claim. The allegations of constructive
    dismissal set out in the proposed amendments relate to events that occurred
    in 1999 well before the transfer to Securicor in 2001; they are unrelated
    to the original claim. The presumption of prejudice occasioned by the passing
    of the limitation period therefore applies and the party seeking the amendment
    must rebut that presumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    material filed does not indicate that the respondent was made aware of these
    new allegations or the appellant’s concerns prior to the appellant seeking
    the amendments. Nor has it been suggested that these events were put in issue
    or encompassed within the original claim. Having failed to rebut the presumption
    of prejudice, the appellant was not entitled to amend the statement of claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the sake of completeness, I note that there is no factual dispute as to when
    the limitation period began to run nor are there facts that might operate
    so as to extend it. In cases where such a factual dispute exists and the
    motion judge is not in a position to resolve it, the amendment will normally
    be allowed and the responding party will be given leave to plead the limitation
    period as a defence: see <i>Zapfe v. Barnes</i> (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 397

    the circumstances, I see no basis to set aside the motion judge’s decision
    and would dismiss the appeal. I would award the respondent partial indemnity
    costs fixed at $5,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
