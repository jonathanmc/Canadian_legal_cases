  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1991, the members of the Toronto Police Association (“TPA”) adopted the Legal
    Assistance Plan to provide financial assistance to members of the Association
    who incurred job-related legal expenses.  The Plan was to be administered
    by the Legal Assistance Plan Board (the “Plan Board”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 25, 2007, the Board of Directors of the TPA (the “TPA Board”) passed
    a resolution purporting to dissolve the Plan Board  (the “Resolution”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    order dated February 27, 2007, the application judge declared that the TPA
    Board did not have the authority to dissolve the Plan Board and that the
    Resolution was, therefore, of no force or effect. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the application judge ordered the TPA Board to return the files
    and materials it had taken from the Plan Board after passing the Resolution,
    and he restrained the TPA Board from “using such files or material for any
    purpose whatsoever.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    TPA appeals both orders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the application judge that the Resolution was of no force and
    effect.  However, with respect, I conclude that the application judge erred
    in making that portion of the order that restrained the TPA Board from using
    the files and materials of the Plan Board for any purpose whatsoever. </p>
  <h4>BACKGROUND </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    TPA is a corporation without share capital created by letters patent issued
    June 28, 1944 pursuant to the <i>Companies Act</i>, R.S.O. 1937, c. 251.  The
    letters patent state that the purposes of the TPA are, among other things:  to
    promote the mutual interests of the members of (what is now) the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto Police Service;  to act as a collective bargaining agency;  and to
    provide financial assistance in accordance with the by-laws of the Corporation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    letters patent give the TPA Board the power to pass by-laws and regulations.  In
    particular, para. 4 provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    directors may, from time to time, make by-laws and regulations, not contrary
    to law or any provision of the Letters Patent, Supplementary Letters Patent,
    if any, or the <i>Companies</i> <i>Act</i>, and, from time to time, amend,
    vary or repeal the same respecting: …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(d)  the control, management and conduct of the affairs of the corporation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant
    to para. 5 of the letters patent, members of the TPA must approve by-laws
    and regulations.  Absent such approval, by-laws and regulations enacted or
    amended by the directors are only effective until the next annual meeting
    of members.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Over
    the years, the TPA has enacted by-laws and regulations covering a wide range
    of matters relating to the organization and management of its affairs and
    to the provision of certain benefits and programs to its members.  The by-laws
    and regulations are found in a document entitled, “Constitution and By-laws,
    Rules and Regulations”.  Collectively, these documents are often referred
    to by the members as “the Constitution”, and I will use that term.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Constitution includes those matters normally found in the organizing by-laws
    of non-share capital corporations such as the requirements for membership,
    the roles and responsibilities of the officers and committees, the procedure
    for calling meetings of members and directors, and the process by which members
    may be disciplined.  The Constitution also includes seven regulations each
    dealing with discrete areas of the TPA’s activities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    appears that the TPA has treated all of the documents found in the Constitution,
    including the regulations, as being constitutional in nature – in the sense
    that approval of the members was obtained when the provisions were first
    enacted and subsequently amended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    June 1991, the members of the TPA, at a general meeting, adopted the Legal
    Assistance Plan, which is now Regulation 7 in the Constitution.  Over the
    years, the Plan has been changed and expanded, but its essential purpose
    and scope have remained the same.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    purpose of the Plan is to provide financial assistance to members who incur
    legal expenses in criminal or civil proceedings relating to the performance
    of their duties.  The Plan is funded by special assessments from the members.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regulation
    7 provides that the Plan shall be governed by a Plan Board which consists
    of five members selected by the Chief Stewards and Stewards every two years.  The
    Plan Board is responsible for carrying out the purpose and intent of the
    Plan.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    10.1.1 of the Constitution sets out the Constitution’s amending process.
    It provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Any general meeting
    [of members] may amend, repeal or re-enact the Constitution and By-laws and <i>the
    Regulations</i> attached hereto by a two-thirds majority.…  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, s. 10.1.1 goes on to set out additional specific requirements for
    the amendment of Regulation 7.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In addition,
    in order to amend Regulation [7],<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the proposed amendment <i>must first have been
    approved</i> by the Board of Administrators of the Financial Assistance for
    Legal Services Plan &amp; Fund and the Board of Directors in accordance with
    Regulation 7.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    notations at the bottom of each page of Regulation 7 indicate that there
    have been amendments or additions to the Regulation on five occasions.  In
    each instance, the amendment or addition was “adopted” or “approved” at either
    a special general or general meeting – clearly referring to a meeting of
    the members.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the latter part of 2006, a dispute arose between the TPA Board and the Plan
    Board.  The affidavits before the application judge paint a picture of conflicting
    positions as to the roles of the two boards as well as difficulties in communications
    between them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons that I discuss below, I do not find it necessary to examine or resolve
    the issues that underlie those disagreements.  It is sufficient to note that,
    on January 25, 2007, as a result of the disagreements, the TPA Board passed
    the Resolution that is the subject of the first ground of this appeal.  The
    Resolution reads in part as follows:</p>

    ordered that it be set aside.  He also issued a mandatory order requiring
    the TPA Board to return the files and other materials of the Plan Board and
    restraining the TPA Board “from using such files or material for any purpose

  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <h2>The Validity of the Resolution</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the TPA Board has the authority to pass the Resolution
    dissolving the Plan Board. The appellant submits there are two sources for
    this authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant relies on the general authority of a Board of Directors to
    manage the affairs of a non-share capital corporation found in s. 283(1)
    of the <i>Corporations Act</i>.  The appellant also relies on s. 3.2.9 of
    the TPA Constitution which authorizes the TPA Board to exercise any power
    that may be exercised by the TPA so long as it is not a power that must be
    exercised by the members at a general meeting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant goes on to argue that Regulation 7 is “a sort of internal ordinance,
    subordinate to the Constitution and By-laws”.  As such, the appellant argues
    that the TPA Board has the authority to amend Regulation 7 without member
    approval.  Finally, the appellant argues that in passing the Resolution the
    TPA Board was exercising its authority to remove for good cause members from
    what is, in effect, a committee of the board, and that a court should not
    interfere with the good faith exercise of the directors’
    “business judgment”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept these arguments.  In my view, the appellant’s arguments misconstrue
    the legal status of Regulation 7 and the resulting need for approval by members
    of any amendments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am satisfied that Regulation 7 has the same legal status and effect as a
    by-law.  Although the <i>Corporations Act</i> does not refer to the enactment
    of regulations, the letters patent do.  Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the letters
    patent, which set out the authority of the TPA Board in relation to making
    by-laws, use the terms “by-law” and “regulation” interchangeably.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    4 gives the TPA Board the authority to make by-laws and regulations, and,
    from time to time, to amend, vary and repeal the same with respect to an
    enumerated list of subjects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    5 of the letters patent provides that a by-law or regulation passed by the
    directors has force only until, at the latest, the next annual meeting of
    members.  If a by-law or regulation is not confirmed by the members by that
    point in time, it ceases to have force.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    it is clear from the letters patent of the TPA that the process and authority
    to enact or amend both regulations and by-laws is exactly the same. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consistent
    with the intention of the letters patent, the TPA has always dealt with Regulation
    7 in the same manner as it would deal with a by-law.  Thus, in 1991, when
    the regulation was first introduced, it was adopted by the members at a general
    meeting.  As well, on the five occasions when Regulation 7 has been amended
    or expanded, the changes have been approved or adopted by the members.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the Constitution to suggest that regulations, and in particular
    Regulation 7, have a different legal status than a by-law.  On the contrary,
    throughout the TPA Constitution, as in the letters patent, the terms regulation
    and by-law are used to describe actions having the same legal status.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn now to the Resolution.  It seems clear that in passing the Resolution,
    the TPA Board purported to amend Regulation 7.  The Resolution sought to
    dissolve the Plan Board and to have the TPA Board assume the duties and responsibilities
    of the Plan Board.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    5 of Regulation 7 creates the Plan Board and sets out the manner in which
    its members are to be appointed.  Paragraph 5 also provides that the Plan
    is to be governed by the Plan Board.  Other provisions in Regulation 7 detail
    extensively how the Plan Board should carry out its responsibilities.  The
    effect of the Resolution, if valid, would be to repeal or amend substantial
    portions of Regulation 7.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the TPA Board did not have the authority to amend Regulation 7.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    10.1.1 of the Constitution specifically addresses how Regulation 7 can be
    amended (para. 18, <i>supra</i>).  It sets out three requirements: approval
    by the Plan Board, approval by the TPA Board, and approval by a majority
    vote of two-thirds of the members.  Section 10.1.1 does not permit amendments
    to Regulation 7 solely by a resolution of the TPA Board.  Nor, does it provide
    that a resolution of the TPA Board amending Regulation 7 would be effective
    pending the two other approvals.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the specific language of s. 10.1.1 of the Constitution leads to
    the conclusion that an amendment to Regulation 7 is not effective until all
    three approvals have been obtained.  As neither the Plan Board nor the members
    approved the Resolution, the TPA Board’s attempt to dissolve the Plan Board
    by means of the Resolution was of no force or effect.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if one were to leave s. 10.1.1 aside, I do not accept the appellant’s arguments
    that s. 283(1) of the <i>Corporations Act</i> or s. 3.2.9 of the TPA Constitution
    provide the necessary authority for the TPA Board to amend Regulation 7.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    283(1) is a general statement of the powers of the board of directors of
    a non-share capital corporation.  It reads, “[t]he affairs of every corporation
    shall be managed by a board of directors howsoever designated.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    283(1) does not address how the Board may exercise those powers and, in particular,
    it does not speak of the requirements for enacting or amending by-laws of
    a corporation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    129 of the <i>Corporations Act</i> specifically addresses the authority of
    a board of directors to pass and amend by-laws.  Section 129(1) confers on  the
    board of directors the power to pass by-laws relating to various enumerated
    matters, including by-laws to regulate the conduct of the affairs of the
    corporation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    129(2) contemplates that by-laws passed under subsection (1), or any amendment
    of an existing by-law, are to be approved by the members of the corporation.  Section
    129(2) provides that a by-law or an amendment to a by-law passed by a board
    of directors is effective “only until the next annual meeting of the members
    unless confirmed thereat.”  Thus, the <i>Corporations Act</i> requires members’
    approval for by-laws or amendments to by-laws.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    my conclusion that Regulation 7 has the legal status of a by-law of the TPA,
    I am of the view that the TPA Board’s authority to amend Regulation 7 must
    be exercised in accordance with s. 129 of the <i>Corporations Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question that then arises is: why was the Resolution not effective pursuant
    to s. 129(2) of the <i>Corporations Act</i> pending member approval at, or
    before the next annual meeting of the TPA?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    problem is that the TPA Board did not pass an amendment to Regulation 7 that
    would require members’ approval pursuant to s. 129(2).  On the contrary,
    para. 3 of the Resolution provided that the TPA Board would exercise the
    powers of the Plan Board until “Regulation 7 could be reviewed and amended” and
    a new Plan Board
    “appointed/elected pursuant to a revised Regulation No. 7.”  The wording
    of the Resolution makes it clear that the TPA Board did not intend to seek
    members’ approval of the Resolution.  Rather, the Resolution contemplated
    only that members would be asked to approve a yet to be developed set of
    amendments to Regulation 7.  Nowhere in the record is it suggested that the
    TPA Board would be seeking members’ approval of the Resolution itself. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    I am satisfied that the TPA Board was not acting pursuant to the authority
    conferred by s. 129 of the <i>Corporations Act</i> when it passed the Resolution.  The
    TPA Board intended to dissolve the Plan Board by its own Resolution – and
    with nothing more.  That being the case, I do not think that the TPA Board
    can now find authority for the Resolution in s. 129(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching this conclusion, I also note that since paras. 4 and 5 of the letters
    patent mirror s. 129(1) and (2) of the <i>Corporations Act</i>, the same
    analysis applies to the appellant’s argument that the TPA Board was acting
    pursuant to the letters patent.  In other words, the letters patent do not
    authorize the TPA Board to pass the Resolution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    I address the appellant’s argument that the Board’s authority to pass the
    Resolution can be found in s. 3.2.9 of the Constitution.  This argument also
    fails.  Section 3.2.9 authorizes the TPA Board to exercise any powers that
    may be exercised by the TPA and that are not “required to be exercised or
    done by the [TPA] at General Meetings of members.”  As pointed out above,
    I am satisfied that the power to amend Regulation 7 is a power that must
    be exercised at a general meeting of the members.  Thus, s. 3.2.9 does not
    assist the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I do not accept the appellant’s argument that the Resolution simply removed
    some members from one of the TPA’s committees.  The Resolution did not seek
    to remove members from the Plan Board, it sought to dissolve the Plan Board
    as an entity within the TPA.  As I have said above, the Plan Board was created
    by Regulation 7 – in effect a by-law of the TPA – and as such, the TPA Board
    did not have the authority to amend that Regulation by a resolution without
    member approval.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, therefore, I agree with the application judge that the TPA Board
    did not have the authority to enact the Resolution.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also note that the determination of whether the TPA Board had the authority
    to pass the Resolution depends entirely on undisputed facts and questions
    of law.  The motives of the directors and the merits of the underlying dispute
    that gave rise to the Resolution are irrelevant.</p>
  <h2>The Mandatory Order</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    4 of the order below reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.  THIS COURT
    FURTHER ORDERS that the TPA Board return forthwith the files and other material
    of the Plan Board appropriated by the TPA Board on or about January 26, 2007
    to the Plan Board and is restrained from using such files or material for
    any purposes whatsoever.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties informed this court that the TPA Board has returned the files and
    materials to the Plan Board.  Thus, the only part of para. 4 still in issue
    is the direction restraining the TPA Board from making any use of such files
    and material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would strike this part of the order for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the respondents did not seek this order in their application, nor does it
    appear to have been part of the argument in the proceeding below.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the Plan Board does not own the files or materials in issue.  The
    Plan Board is not a legal entity; and in fact it is not a party to these
    proceedings.  The respondents are individuals who, at the time the files
    and materials were seized, were members of the Plan Board.  They have no
    personal interest or proprietary rights to the information contained in the
    files or materials that were seized from the Plan Board.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the TPA Board has the ultimate responsibility for managing the affairs of
    the TPA.  Without knowing specifically what information is contained in the
    files or materials at issue, it is difficult to envision the basis upon which
    the TPA Board could be restrained from having access to such information “for
    any purpose whatsoever”.  Even assuming that there is some basis to restrain
    the TPA Board from accessing certain specific information, there is nothing
    in the record to support making any such order.  Clearly, there is nothing
    in the record to support making an order of the breadth of para. 4. </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, I am satisfied that the portion of para. 4 restraining the TPA
    Board from using the files or materials of the Plan Board for any purpose
    whatsoever must be set aside.</p>

    there is some urgency expressed by both parties to have the issue resolved

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[5]  It is my
    view, and I believe the parties agree that the resolution of this issue must
    proceed without passing judgment on the propriety or impropriety of the conduct

    that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)  The proceedings
    is by way of application in circumstances in which it is fair to say the
    parties implicitly acknowledge that there are no material facts in dispute.</p>

      these particular circumstances</u> whether the TPA Board had the jurisdiction
      to pass the impugned January 25, 2007 resolution does not depend on the
      motivation of the Directors of the TPA Board.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>

    such as the TPA.  One difference is that, unlike the letters patent, s. 129(2)
    does not refer to the enactment of regulations.  </p>
