    appellant, a police officer, was convicted of criminal harassment and extortion.  He
    appeals against conviction for criminal harassment on the basis that the
    elements of the offence had not been proven.  With respect to the conviction
    for extortion, his appeal against conviction is founded on the basis that
    the trial judge erred by determining that the appellant had a motive to lie
    to escape conviction.  See <i>R. v. B.(L.)</i> (1993), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 189
    (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The appellant contends that the trial judge used that determination to
    erroneously assess his credibility.  Finally, the appellant argues that the
    sentence was unduly harsh and excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b><i>Criminal
        Harassment </i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    establish harassment under s. 264(2)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the
    Crown had to establish that the appellant engaged in “threatening conduct”.  We
    accept the definition of threatening conduct given in <i>R. v. George </i>(2002),
    162 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Y.T.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 39 that, in order to meet the objectives of s. 264, the threatening
    conduct must amount to a “tool of intimidation which is designed to instill
    a sense of fear in the recipient”.  The impugned conduct is to be viewed
    objectively, with due consideration for the circumstances in which they took
    place, and with regard to the effects those acts had on the recipient.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    brief, the conduct in question is as follows.  The appellant and the complainant
    knew one another but had virtually no contact in the three years prior to
    the incident.  The incident took place in broad daylight in downtown
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay while the complainant was walking down
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Main Street with her five-year old daughter, after having left a bank.  The
    appellant was dressed in full police uniform and also on foot on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Main Street.  He wolf-whistled at the complainant, said
    “nice butt” or “nice ass” and then, after the complainant sped up to get
    away from him, called out “are those pants painted on”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant’s conduct was clearly inappropriate and unwanted, we do not
    see the incident as amounting to threatening conduct within the meaning of
    those words in s. 264(2)(d).  Although the complainant justifiably felt upset
    and scared by the appellant’s conduct, viewed objectively, we do not see
    it as rising to the level of a “tool of intimidation designed to instill
    a sense of fear”.</p>
  <h3><i>Extortion</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that there has been no suggestion that the appellant’s conduct in relation
    to the second complainant, as found by the trial judge, could not amount
    to extortion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the argument that the trial judge assessed the appellant’s
    credibility by referring to his motive to lie at trial.  In the circumstances
    of this case and reading the reasons as a whole, we understand the trial
    judge’s reference to a motive related to his view of the appellant’s motive
    to commit the offence
    – not to the appellant’s motive to lie in giving his trial testimony.  The
    trial judge was entitled to make that determination and to reject the appellant’s
    evidence should he do so.  In any event, there was ample evidence on which
    the trial judge could find that the appellant had threatened to make Mr.
    Tiedke’s life a living hell, should Mr. Tiedke not lie for him.   </p>
  <h3><i>Sentence</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offence of extortion is a serious one.  We see no error in the 90-day sentence
    imposed by the trial judge, particularly as the appellant was a police officer
    who stood in the position of a mentor to Mr. Tiedke at the relevant time.</p>
  <h3>DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would allow the appeal in part, set aside the conviction for harassment
    and enter an acquittal.  In all other regards, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
