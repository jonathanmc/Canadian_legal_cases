  <h3>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question in this case is whether an
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario court should order a child’s return to this province for a custody
    hearing when an appellate court and a trial court in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    have decided against ordering that child’s return. Determining whether to
    decline jurisdiction in favour of the American courts requires an analysis
    of the Hague Convention on international child abduction, the basis for the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    courts’ decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    are signatories to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
    Child Abduction (“Hague Convention” or “Convention”).  The important purposes
    of the Convention are stated in Article 1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
    secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in
    any
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Contracting
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    State; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
    ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

w:st="on">
    State are effectively respected in the other

    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    3 of the Convention defines wrongful removal or retention of a child in terms
    of a breach of the custody rights of a person (usually a parent) “under the
    law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before
    the removal or retention”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hague Convention places a strong duty on Contracting States to return children
    wrongfully removed to or retained in their countries.  However, the duty
    is not absolute; Articles 12, 13 and 20 provide for exceptions to the obligation
    to return a child: see <i>Thomson v. Thomson</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551 at
    pp. 594-95.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exception in play in this appeal is contained in Article 13(2)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judicial or administrative authority may also
    refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects
    to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which
    it is appropriate to take account of its views.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this appeal, the issue of the child’s views about where he desires to live
    arises in a complicated context involving conflicting custody orders in three
    countries – the United States, Sri Lanka and Canada –
    and a good deal of non-compliance with those orders by both parents.  Moreover,
    between August 2005 and April 2007, five different Canadian and American
    courts have issued seven different and, in important respects, conflicting
    orders respecting the parties to this case.</p>

    mother immediately resorted to the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts when she realized that Jonathan was not returning home.  On
    August 17, 2005, Eberhard J. of the Superior Court of Justice made an <i>ex
    parte</i> order granting interim and permanent custody of Jonathan to the
    mother.  In the material filed in support of her motion, the mother included
    the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Sri Lanka</st1:country-region>
    custody order in her favour.  However, she said nothing about the original
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma court order granting custody to the father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother then brought a petition to the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Oklahoma seeking an order returning Jonathan to her custody
    in Canada pursuant to the Hague Convention.  A full hearing before Magistrate
    Judge Kimberly West took place on January 18, 2006.  The mother and father
    were both present and were represented by counsel.  Following the hearing,
    both parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 15, 2006, Judge West released a 17-page decision.  She denied the
    mother’s petition, essentially for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Judge West held that the mother was attempting to use the Hague Convention
    for an improper purpose, namely, to overcome her violation of the non-removal
    order of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Oklahoma court in 1994:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he fact remains Petitioner violated an express
    and unequivocal court order issued by an Oklahoma court with competent jurisdiction,
    the existence of which she possessed actual notice [of] and now is attempting
    to circumvent international law by creating a habitual residence for Jonathan
    to her unfair advantage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Judge West attached considerable weight to Jonathan’s express view that he
    preferred to stay in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Oklahoma.  With the consent of the parties, Judge West had interviewed Jonathan <i>in
    camera</i> in her chambers.  A law clerk and court reporter were in attendance,
    but not the parties or their counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the “Findings of Fact” section of her judgment, Judge West described the
    interview with Jonathan in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            During his stay in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma, Jonathan has maintained telephonic contact with Petitioner and
    Jonathan’s sister.  Jonathan expressed to this Court his desire to remain
    with Respondents because
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ardmore has better schools than in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and he likes Respondents’ house.  Jonathan appears comfortable in his current
    surroundings, well-settled in school and with friends and genuinely desirous
    of remaining in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma.  Jonathan shows no animosity for Petitioner and states Respondents
    have not spoken ill of her or discourages Jonathan from maintaining mostly
    unfettered contact with Petitioner and his step-sibling.  In sum, Jonathan
    demonstrated a remarkable grasp of the situation, the conflict between his
    parents and the proceeding.  It is the evaluation of this Court that Jonathan
    has demonstrated a sufficient degree of maturity whereby his views and opinions
    may be given some persuasive weight. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the “Conclusions of Law” section of her judgment, Judge West stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            This Court has also considered Jonathan’s
    expressed opinions as to his status in accordance with Article 13(b) of the
    Hague Convention.  42 U.S.C. § 11603(e)(2)(A).  This Court observed Jonathan
    to be a bright, expressive child with a well-developed understanding of his
    situation and the positions of his parents.  He has attained an age and degree

    Jonathan’s habitual residence was
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario which gave the

    the hearing, the father advanced an alternative argument, namely, that, even

    Ontario courts had jurisdiction, the motion judge should decline jurisdiction
    in favour of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Oklahoma courts.  In support of this submission, the father’s counsel referred
    to Article 13(2) of the Hague Convention.  About midway through the hearing,
    the motion judge signalled to the parties that he did not accept this submission.  In
    his view, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    final step in the American side of the proceedings took place on April 6,

    the decision of Judge West of the District Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be recalled that Judge West had decided against the mother on two bases – the
    continuing validity and primacy of the original 1994 Oklahoma custody order
    and Jonathan’s views as given credit pursuant to Article 13(2) of the Hague
    Convention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Tenth Circuit court disagreed with the first basis for Judge West’s decision.  Circuit

    of custody is the habitual residence of the child at the relevant time, which
    in Jonathan’s case was
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

    the Tenth Circuit strongly endorsed the second basis for Judge West’s decision,
    namely, her ascertainment of, and proper regard for, Jonathan’s views and
    preferences.  After a detailed review of Article 13(2) of the Hague Convention,
    case law interpreting this article, and Judge West’s process for determining
    Jonathan’s views and preferences followed by her assessment of them, Circuit
    Judge Profilio concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While a father’s largesse could naturally be a
    factor in a child’s decision, our reading of the record suggests this was
    taken into consideration by the magistrate judge.  Moreover, the fact Jonathan
    and his father have discussed relocation over a period of time, and that
    Jonathan returned to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    during the period of those ongoing discussions, convince us that this was
    a considered decision on Jonathan’s part and represents his honest wishes.  We
    are also mindful of the magistrate judge’s opportunity to observe Jonathan
    in person, and we accord great deference to the court’s findings based on
    that experience.  Given the court’s duty to consider Jonathan’s best interest
    and to determine whether he was of sufficient age and maturity to weigh in
    on this matter, we find no error in the district court’s ultimate conclusion
    that Jonathan should remain in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma while
    <st1:State

    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (2)       When this trial was scheduled,
    Justice O’Neill anticipated the

    would have a chance to experience life in Ont with his mother before the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            However, the

  <h3>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    the most important factors guiding courts’
    decisions to decline jurisdiction is comity – the deference owed to the legitimate
    judicial acts of other countries: see <i><span style='color:black'>Amchem
    Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation Board)</span></i><span style='color:black'>,
    [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 </span>at pp. 912-15; <i><span
style='color:black'>Antares Shipping Corp. v. The Ship “Capricorn”</span></i><span
style='color:black'>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 422</span> at p. 448; <i>Beals</i> <i>v.
    Saldanha</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416.  Comity is at the core of this case. The
    Superior Court order under appeal orders American authorities to return Jonathan
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Decisions by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    federal courts at the trial and appellate level say the opposite; they decline
    to order Jonathan’s return.  The key question in this case is therefore whether
    this court should defer to the Tenth Circuit’s decision to refuse to return
    Jonathan to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    under the Hague Convention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond
    the overarching principle of comity, the Hague Convention’s effectiveness
    depends on there being a general respect for the decisions under the Convention
    by the courts of the Contracting State to which the child has been removed.  It
    is these courts that have primary responsibility for adjudicating Hague Convention
    applications: <span style='color:black'>see <i>Caruso v. Caruso</i>, [2006]
    O.J. No. 5311 (S.C.J.).   </span>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    combination of comity, on the one hand, and of the need to preserve the Hague
    Convention’s effectiveness, on the other, calls for courts to avoid interfering,
    as much as possible, with foreign interpretations of the Convention.  As
    such, this court should respect the Tenth Circuit’s decision not to order
    Jonathan’s return to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    unless that decision evinces a clear misinterpretation of the Hague Convention
    or fails to meet a minimum standard of reasonableness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    starting point in any case involving the Hague Convention must be to recognize
    its predominant objective – securing the prompt return of abducted children
    to the country where they habitually reside.  As expressed by La Forest J.
    in <i>Thomson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 559: “The underlying purpose of the
    Convention, as set forth in its preamble, is to protect children from the
    harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures
    to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence.”  The
    Convention is founded on the assumption that a wrongfully removed or retained
    child’s best interests will usually lie in the child’s prompt return to the
    country of habitual residence, and that the deterrent effect on wrongful
    removals or retentions of the Convention’s mandatory return procedure will
    also serve the interests of children generally: see <i>W. (V.) v. S. (D.)</i>,
    [1996] 2 S.C.R. 108 at para. 77.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Convention provides for exceptions to the mandatory return of abducted
    or wrongfully retained children to their country of habitual residence.  Four
    exceptions permitting non-return relate (i) to children who have become settled
    in their new environment (Article 12); (ii) to a situation where the custodial
    parent in the country of habitual residence was not exercising custody rights
    at the time of removal or retention, or consented or subsequently acquiesced
    to the removal or retention (Article 13(1)(a)); (iii) to a situation where
    there is a grave risk that the child’s return would expose the child to physical
    or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation
    (Article 13(1)(b)); and (iv) to a situation where return would violate the
    fundamental principles of the requested country relating to the protection
    of human rights and fundamental freedoms (Article 20).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fifth exception, central to this appeal, is contained in Article 13(2) of
    the Convention which, for ease of reference, I set out again:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judicial or administrative authority may also
    refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects
    to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which
    it is appropriate to take account of its views.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary reason Article 13(2) exists is simple: given that the Convention
    applies only to people under age 16 (Article 4), it would not make sense
    to apply the return mechanism with its full force to children close to age
    16.  The Convention’s reporter, Elisa Pérez-Vera, in her “Explanatory Report” in
    Hague Conference on Private International Law, <i>Acts and Documents of the
    Fourteenth Session</i>, vol. 3 (The Hague: 1980) at para. 30, describes Article
    13(2) as “absolutely necessary given the fact that the Convention applies, <i>ratione</i> <i>personae</i>,
    to all children under the age of sixteen; the fact must be acknowledged that
    it would be very difficult to accept that a child of, for example, fifteen
    years of age, should be returned against its will.”</p>

    13(2) requires a court to engage in two inquiries: (1) does the child object
    to being returned; and (2) has the child attained an age and degree of maturity
    at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judge
    West of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma
    undertook both of these inquiries.  With the consent of the parties, she
    conducted an <i>in camera</i> interview in her chambers with Jonathan.  Her
    law clerk and a court reporter were also present.  Jonathan was a few days
    short of his thirteenth birthday when this interview took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judge
    West stated that Jonathan “demonstrated a remarkable grasp of the situation,
    the conflict between his parents and the proceeding.”  He showed no animosity
    towards his mother.  He was not improperly influenced by his father.  Thus,
    Judge West concluded, Jonathan had attained an age and degree of maturity “whereby
    his views and opinions may be given some persuasive weight.”  Jonathan’s
    views, as recorded by Judge West, included “his desire to remain in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma with [his father]”.  Accordingly, Judge West refused to order Jonathan’s
    return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  A year later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
    dismissed the mother’s appeal from Judge West’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Tenth Circuit’s decision merits deference.  It is not a clear
    misinterpretation of the Hague Convention and does not fail to meet a minimum
    reasonableness standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no doubt that Jonathan had “attained an age and degree of maturity
    at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.”  When Judge West
    presided over the hearing in January 2006, Jonathan was a few days shy of
    13.  The parties agreed that Judge West should interview Jonathan, a clear
    sign that they recognized his maturity and the relevance of his views.  I
    note, parenthetically, that the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C-12, s. 64(2), specifically permits a court to interview a child
    to determine the child’s views and preferences in a custody proceeding.  Finally,
    Judge West, who interviewed Jonathan, described him as “a bright, expressive
    child with a well-developed understanding of his situation and the positions
    of his parents.”  Accordingly, Judge West concluded that Jonathan had attained
    an age and maturity “whereby his views and opinions may be given some persuasive
    weight.”  The Tenth Circuit affirmed this component of Judge West’s reasoning.  I
    see no basis for challenging this conclusion of the two
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second issue, Judge West recorded Jonathan as expressing “his desire
    to remain with [his father]” and, later, “his desire to remain in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma with [his father]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    might be contended that a “desire” to remain in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Oklahoma is not the same as an objection to returning to
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, which is what Article 13(2) requires.  However, such a distinction
    is strained.  Judge West recorded Jonathan’s reasons for preferring to stay
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma, including his comfort in his father’s home and his satisfaction
    with his school, activities and friends in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ardmore.  On her description, Jonathan compared his life in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma with the possibility of living in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and came out in favour of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma.  In these circumstances, a fair conclusion is that Jonathan’s “desire” to
    stay in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Oklahoma comprehends an objection to returning to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, at least at this point in his life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that Judge West’s invocation of Article 13(2) of
    the Hague Convention to refuse to order Jonathan’s return to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, and the Tenth Circuit’s affirmation of that decision, deserve deference
    from this court.</p>

    make one final observation.  If the parties cannot resolve their dispute,
    a custody hearing on the merits must take place in the appropriate
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma court.  As the Tenth Circuit court emphasized, the original 1994
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma court order granting custody of Jonathan to the father no longer
    governs.  Accordingly, a new custody hearing in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oklahoma will be necessary if the dispute cannot be resolved.  Jonathan will
    be 15 years old next month.  His opinion regarding where he wants to live
    will be even more than highly persuasive – it will probably be determinative.  Accordingly,
    the parties should seriously consider a means of fairly ascertaining Jonathan’s
    views without further delay, expense and conflict so that both parents can
    be actively involved in Jonathan’s life.</p>
