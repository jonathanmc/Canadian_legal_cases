  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant,
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Kenneth E. Street, was thrown while exercising a horse at Woodbine Race Track
    in February, 1993. He was seriously injured and now suffers from incomplete
    quadriplegia. The appellant’s claim for Worker’s Compensation (WC) was denied
    on the basis that
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    William Lane, the trainer who had hired him to ride the horse, failed to
    maintain coverage for him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    29.09 of the Rules of Thoroughbred Racing makes it mandatory for trainers
    to provide coverage for their employees. These rules are promulgated by the
    respondent Ontario Racing Commission, the body created by statute to oversee
    and regulate horse racing in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. The rule requires any person “who places any licensee in a horse
    related occupation on their payroll at the race track” to cover that person
    with WC insurance and to keep that person covered
    “throughout the time he/she is in their employ.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sued Lane, the owners of the horse, the Ontario Jockey Club (which
    owns Woodbine Racetrack) and the Commission for damages equal to the amount
    of benefits to which he would have been entitled had his employer held WC
    coverage. He alleged that they each owed him a duty of care to ensure that
    he had WC coverage and had been negligent in the performance of that duty.
    The appellant succeeded only against Lane. He appeals the dismissal of his
    claim against the Commission and the Jockey Club.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the Commission the trial judge held: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)         The Commission did not owe a private
    law duty of care to the appellant to ensure that its rules were followed
    and, if it did, any such duty would be negated for policy reasons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)         If it did owe such a duty, the Commission’s
    actions met the standard of care because of the prosecutions it conducted. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)         The evidence did not establish that
    the Commission was the cause of the appellant’s loss. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the Jockey Club the trial judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)         There was no contractual or employment
    relationship of any nature between the appellant and the Jockey Club.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)         The Jockey Club did not play any role
    in the Commission’s decision to pass Rule 29.09.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)         The Commission did not delegate to the
    Jockey Club the power to enforce the rule.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)         There was no evidence to prove that
    the Jockey Club had any reason to believe that Lane provided incorrect WC
    information in the stabling application he submitted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e)         The Jockey Club had no reason to believe
    or anticipate that the employees of Lane, including the appellant, would
    not be covered by WC. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>f)         However, if it was under a duty of care
    to the appellant, the Jockey Club breached its duty, as it took no active
    steps to ensure coverage was in place. </p>
  <h3>The Parties’ Arguments</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that the Commission
    and the Jockey Club owed no private law duty of care to the appellant to
    enforce Rule 29.09. The appellant submits that, in addition to passing a
    rule making it mandatory for people such as Lane to have WC coverage, the
    Commission sought to enforce the rule and did so negligently. The appellant
    submits that the Commission was negligent because it did not obtain a clearance
    certificate from the WC Board confirming the existence of coverage. Rather,
    the Commission merely required a WC account number, which remains with an
    individual for life, notwithstanding that the account may not be in good
    standing or that coverage has lapsed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commission’s position is that it did not owe a private law duty of care to
    the appellant. Even if it did owe such a duty, the trial judge’s finding
    that it had discharged that duty is entitled to deference. The Commission
    required an applicant to provide his WC account number when applying for
    a licence. This application was then submitted to the Commission. On the
    first application for a licence, trainers were required to provide evidence
    that WC was in place at the time of application, for instance by providing
    an employer’s statement of payroll. Thereafter, trainers were required to
    provide their WC number and to verify that they were in compliance with the
    Commission Rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the Commission took other steps to ensure compliance. It prosecuted
    five violations of Rule 29.09 in the first 18 months after it was passed
    and continued to prosecute all known violations of the rule. As the trial
    judge found, if Lane had obtained a clearance certificate at the time of
    his application in May, 1992, it would have been valid for only 45 days and
    would not have been in force at the time of the accident. The appellant’s
    submission that Lane would likely have gotten retroactive relief from the
    WC Board is not supported in the particular circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Jockey Club required an applicant executing an application to stable horses
    on its facilities to provide a WC account number. The appellant submits that
    the Jockey Club similarly breached its duty of care to the appellant by not
    implementing any reasonable mechanism to ensure compliance with Rule 29.09.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Jockey Club relies on the findings of fact of the trial judge (which are
    not in dispute) and his conclusion that it owed no duty of care to the appellant.
    The purpose of requiring an applicant to insert his or her WC number in a
    stabling application was to bring to the attention of the applicant the existence
    of Rule 29.09. The Jockey Club was not involved in enforcing the rule. In
    addition, the Jockey Club submits that, like a rule of law, it had the right
    to expect that the Commission’s rule would be obeyed. </p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    general test for a duty of care has its origin in the House of Lords’ decision
    in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson, </i>[1932] A.C. 562, in which Lord Atkin recognized
    the existence of a duty to avoid foreseeeable harm to one’s neighbours. “Neighbours” in
    this context, are “persons who are so closely and directly affected by my
    act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected”.
    In <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, </i>[1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.),
    Lord Wilberforce proposed a two-stage approach for determining whether a
    duty of care arises. The Supreme Court of Canada adopted this test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Kamloops</i><i> (City of) v. Nielsen</i>,<i> </i>[1984] 2 S.C.R. 2, at
    10-11, and recast it as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       Is there “a sufficiently close relationship
    between the    parties” or
    “proximity” to justify imposition of a duty? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       If so, are there policy considerations
    which ought to negate or limit the scope of the duty, the class of persons
    to whom it is owed or the damages to which breach may give rise?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Anns </i>analysis
    need not be undertaken in every case. If, having regard to precedent, the
    category of relationship is one giving rise to a duty of care, proximity
    may be inferred and if the risk of injury was foreseeable, a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> duty
    of care will arise:  <i>Cooper v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hobart, </i>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 537. In this case, since the claim is a new category
    of claim, there is no dispute that it is necessary to undertake the <i>Anns </i>analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the <i>Anns </i>test in <i>Odhavji Estate
    v. Woodhouse, </i>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, but separated foreseeability and proximity
    as separate elements at the first stage. <i>Odhavji </i>did not change the <i>Anns </i>test,
    but clarified that proximity will not always be satisfied by reasonable foreseeability: <i>Childs
    v. Desormeaux, </i><span class=selected>[2006] 1 S.C.R. 643 </span>at para.
    12. McLachlin C.J.C. on behalf of the court added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What is clear is that at stage one, foreseeability
    and factors going to the relationship between the parties must be considered
    with a view to determining whether a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care arises.
    At stage two, the issue is whether this duty is negated by other, broader
    policy considerations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents do not dispute that the appellant’s loss was foreseeable. The
    appellant was part of a distinct group of persons who would potentially be
    injured and would suffer damage if Rule 29.09 was not followed. Inasmuch
    as foreseeability of harm is present, I must therefore next consider
    “factors going to the relationship between the parties”. As stated in <i>Cooper,
    supra, </i>at para. 34 “the expectations, representations, reliance and the
    property or other interests involved” must be considered to determine whether
    the relationship is close enough that it is “just and fair having regard
    to the relationship to impose a duty of care in law upon the defendant.”  See
    also <i>Childs, supra, </i>at para. 25. Thus, the question is what, if anything,
    links the Commission and Jockey Club to third-party exercise riders such
    as the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a situation where the appellant has suffered personal injury as a
    result of the actions of a person benefiting financially from service to
    the public at large, such as the service of alcohol, as in <i>Jordan House
    Ltd. v. Menow, </i>[1974] S.C.R. 239. The Commission did not offer a service
    to the public at large from which it benefited. The Jockey Club does offer
    a service to the public at large, the stabling of horses and the provision
    of exercise facilities, but the appellant does not submit that this service
    created or enlarged the risk that he would suffer damage if he was not covered
    by WC. Nor is this a situation where a person owing a fiduciary duty to another
    has assumed control over the actions of the person to whom the duty is owed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  One
    case-specific factor applicable in this situation is the existence of a statute
    regulating the activity in question. The statute does not specifically state
    that those who breach the statutory duty imposed on them should be liable
    to the individuals affected. More importantly, in regulatory cases involving
    pure economic loss, a legislative intent not to impose a private law duty
    of care has been inferred: <i>Edwards v. Law Society of Upper Canada, </i>[2001]
    3 S.C.R. 562 and <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge examined the statutory scheme of the governing statute at the
    time, the <i>Racing Commission Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.2, and found that
    as in <i>Cooper, </i>the only source of the Commission’s powers and duties
    was its governing statute. The Commission’s implied mandate by statute was
    to serve the interests of all
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario in the public interest. Rule 29.09 placed the obligation of compliance
    on trainers. To hold that the Commission had a duty to ensure compliance
    would transfer that obligation back to the Commission and “override its decision
    to place that obligation elsewhere”. I would agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that even if the Legislature did not intend for the Commission
    to be under a duty to ensure compliance with its rules, once the Commission
    began enforcing its rules through prosecutions for violation, it was under
    a duty to ensure compliance by obtaining a clearance certificate from the
    WC Board or be held liable in negligence. I would respectfully disagree with
    this conclusion. The statutory discretion given to the Commission by the <i>Racing
    Commission Act</i> permits, but does not require, enforcement. The Commission’s
    decision respecting the extent of compliance required it to consider a “myriad
    of objectives consistent with public rather than private law duties” as stated
    in <i>Edwards, supra, </i>at para. 14. See also <i>L.(A.) v. Ontario </i>(2006),
    218 O.A.C. 150, <i>Eliopoulos v. Ontario </i>(2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.),
    and <i>Granite Power Corp. v. Ontario, </i>(2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 194 (C.A.),
    where this court also rejected the imposition of a private law duty of care
    on the public body in issue on the basis that the claims were at odds with
    the particular public body’s statutory duty to the public as a whole and
    required a balancing of constituent interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i> </i> Insofar
    as the Jockey Club is concerned, it was not under a duty to enforce Rule
    29.09. Merely requiring the applicant’s WC number did not create such a duty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    while the appellant’s counsel submitted in oral argument that the appellant
    relied on the Commission and Jockey Club to ensure compliance with Rule 29.09,
    there is no evidence before us to that effect or that the Commission or the
    Jockey Club made any representations to the appellant to engender reliance
    that compliance with Rule 29.09 was ensured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not err in concluding that while the appellant’s loss was
    foreseeable to the Commission, there was not sufficient proximity between
    them to create a duty of care to ensure that its rules were followed. The
    evidence does not establish a close relationship between the Commission and
    the appellant. Similarly, the trial judge did not err in dismissing the appellant’s
