    trial judge ordered the respondent, Robert Fisher, to pay the appellant,
    Anita Fisher, $2,600 spousal support from March 1 to December 1, 2006; $1,800
    for the calendar year 2007; and $1,050 for the calendar year 2008.  The order
    makes no award of support for 2009; however, it provides that, after January
    1, 2009, either party may “seek a review of both entitlement and/or quantum … without
    the need to establish a material change in circumstances.”  The trial judge
    declined to make support retroactive, leaving the appellant with the $2,000
    monthly interim support she was awarded for the period from October 1, 2004
    until the end of trial.  The order also requires the respondent to disclose
    his income to the appellant on an annual basis.  It does not contain a reciprocal
    provision for the appellant to disclose her income to the respondent.  </p>

    appellant challenges the trial judge’s factual findings.  She also argues
    that the trial judge erred in his application of the law by time-limiting/reviewing
    support, by failing to order support payable from the date of the interim
    order, by failing to apply the <i>Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines: A
    Draft Proposal </i>(Ottawa: Department of Justice, 2005) (the Guidelines),
    and by reducing the amount of support based on the respondent’s obligations
    to his second family.</p>

    October 1, 2004.  I would step down spousal support on April 1, 2008 to $1,500
    and terminate it on September 1, 2011.  This would provide the appellant
    with seven years of spousal support, subject of course to any variation order
    made in accordance with s. 17 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.3

    graduation, the respondent taught high school for eleven years, earning $65,000
    in his final year.  In 1999, the respondent accepted employment in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (O.S.S.T.F.)
    at an increased salary.  Over the three years prior to separation, the respondent
    earned increasing amounts of income.  By 2003, he was earning $81,800.  In
    February 2004, the respondent accepted a position with the O.S.S.T.F. in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto at an annual salary of $120,000, plus car allowance and benefits.  The
    parties separated two months later.  The respondent earned approximately
    $132,000 in 2005 and $140,000 in 2006, both amounts including car allowance
    and benefits.</p>

    to stay at home with her two pre-school-age children.  During this time,
    she worked part time as a day care aide. </p>

    2005, the new partner and her children moved to Canada to join the respondent.
    Until she married the respondent and obtained the necessary immigration status,
    the new partner was prohibited from employment in Canada. As well, she needed
    to retrain to meet Ontario physiotherapist qualifications. However, even
    though both children attended school full time, the new partner elected not
    to retrain, but instead to stay at home. Her only apparent contribution to
    the family income is the U.S.$700 monthly child support she receives from
    the children&rsquo;s biological father, who earns U.S.$70,000 annually. The
    trial judge also imputed $10,000 of notional annual income to her based on
    her prior U.S. day care employment.</p>

    appellant had a high school education when the parties married.  During the
    marriage she took university courses, mostly through distance education.  After
    separation, she returned to university and was one and a half credits short

    the trial judge found that the appellant worked full time throughout the
    marriage, the parties agree that her work, until 1999, was often part time,
    or seasonal, with periods of absence from the work force.  It is conceded
    that, from 1984 to 1999, the appellant was only employed full time approximately
    half the time.  However, she did work full time in the area of advertising
    sales during the last years of the marriage.</p>

    the most part, the appellant earned an average annual income of $30,000.  For
    about two years before separation, she had a commission job that provided
    a base salary of $35,000 with a total income of $41,000, including commissions.  This
    was the highest income she ever earned.</p>

    his
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto employment.  Several months after separation, the appellant became
    clinically depressed.  She took disability leave from October 2004 to September
    2005, for which she received $19,500 of gross disability benefits from her
    insurer.  The appellant has since returned to full-time employment.  At the
    time of trial, she earned $30,000 annually. </p>

    parties equalized their assets, including the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial
    home and the respondent’s pension, with the respondent paying the appellant
    an equalization payment of approximately $102,000.  From this, the appellant
    bought a $191,000 home, which the trial judge found was a “huge ‘step down’” in
    lifestyle that resulted from the respondent’s “decision to terminate their
    marriage.”  In contrast, the respondent bought a $328,000 home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    at trial and on appeal, the respondent argued that spousal support should
    be terminated and the appellant considered self-sufficient at her current
    $30,000 income.  The appellant argued for support at $3,000 monthly, retroactive
    to October 2004, and ongoing indefinite support of $3,500, reviewable on
    or after September 1, 2012.  While entitlement to support was agreed upon
    both at trial and on appeal, the trial judge discussed, and counsel argued,
    the principles regarding entitlement that are also relevant to the issue
    of quantum.  </p>

    parties agree that the experienced trial judge correctly canvassed the legal
    principles.  He recognized the factors and objectives set out in s. 15.2
    of the <i>Divorce Act</i>.<span lang=EN-US>  He reviewed the seminal authorities,
    including <i>Moge </i></span><i>v. Moge</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R 813, regarding
    compensatory support, and <i>Bracklow v. Bracklow</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420,
    regarding needs-based support.  He considered questions of economic disadvantage,
    economic hardship, self-sufficiency and the reduction in the appellant’s
    standard of living.  He concluded that the appellant “fits entirely within
    the jurisprudential criteria of having suffered an ‘economic disadvantage’ by
    Mr. Fisher’s decision to [end] the marriage.”</p>

      the trial judge’s view, the respondent’s obligations to his second family

      to <i>Kugler v. Kugler, </i>(1994), 8 R.F.L. (4th) 205 at para. 49 (Ont.

      conditions of the first family while devastating the second family.”  The </span><span lang=EN-US>trial
      judge also recognized that a payor cannot avoid a support obligation by
      assuming new liabilities or by relying on new obligations to a second family.  He
      also noted that a new partner is expected to contribute to the second family’s
      expenses. </span><span

    for the principle that time-limited support should only be ordered in “unusual” or

      as a result of the breakdown of the marriage. (para. 33)</span></p>

    that the discretionary decision of the trial judge, who in any event is very
    experienced, is entitled to considerable deference and should not be interfered

    I have indicated, it was common ground that the appellant did not work full
    time throughout the marriage.  Accordingly, the trial judge erred in finding
    that she worked full time.  Such a finding likely affected his determination
    of the quantum of the appellant’s support. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><i>b)         Sufficient employment income</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified about her employment income.  <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>At
    its highest, the appellant’s testimony included an expression of her
    “hope” that her income would increase to $35,000 in a couple of years.  </span>On
    this evidence, the trial judge concluded that <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>the
    appellant “predicts that after about three years her [$30,000] income will
    increase and her employment position will solidify.”(para. 67)  The appellant
    argues that this finding is not supported by the evidence because a “prediction”
    invokes more certainty than does a “hope”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>The
      trial judge’s uncertainty about the appellant’s prospects is reflected
      in another part of his reasons, also challenged by the appellant, when
      he said: “</span><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>I speculate that over the next few years Ms. Fisher
      will become entirely self-sufficient”.  The appellant argues that the trial
      judge was not entitled to base his decision on speculation.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>In
      my view, while the choice of the word “speculate” was unfortunate, when
      considered in the context of the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, the
      trial judge meant no more than that he anticipated the appellant’s income
      might return to the $40,000 level once she was able to build a commission
      base in her new employment.  It was likely precisely because the trial
      judge recognized this uncertainty that he provided for a subsequent review
      of the support order.  Accordingly, while different terminology would have
      been preferable, </span>I am not persuaded that any misstatement by the
      trial judge on this point materially affected his decision<span lang=EN style='color:black;'>.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>However,
      the uncertainty regarding the appellant’s employment income is relevant
      to both the review order and the trial judge’s analysis of the appellant’s
      self-sufficiency, which I will discuss in detail later.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>In
      his reasons, the trial judge also “speculate[s]” that the appellant would “perhaps
      enter into a new relationship (or partnership) whereby her day-to-day expenses
      can at least be shared.” (para. 69)  It is conceded that this comment was
      not supported by the evidence.  Indeed, there was no evidence that the
      appellant even had a relationship with any potential partner.  In my opinion,
      the trial judge’s unwarranted comment was an error that contributed to
      his decision to provide what he described as a</span><span lang=EN> </span>“type
      of time-limited review spousal support order.”</p>

      errors regarding the appellant’s employment and potential new relationship,
      particularly when considered in combination with the discussion that follows
      about the impact of the respondent’s second family on his support obligation,
      and the circumstances in which “termination/review” orders are appropriate,
      lead to the conclusion that the trial award must be set aside.  It is not
      necessary that the matter be returned for a new trial because there are
      no factual disputes that would justify the delay and expense that would
      necessarily be incurred.  Accordingly, it falls to this court to assess
      the appropriate quantum of spousal support.  </span></p>

    will deal with each of the relevant factors and objectives in turn, mindful,
    as was the trial judge, of the admonition that no one objective predominates;
    rather, it is important to balance all four objectives in the context of
    the circumstances of the particular case: See <i>Moge v. Moge </i>at para.
    52; <i>Bracklow v. Bracklow </i>at para. 35 and <i>Miglin v. Miglin, </i>[2003]
    1 S.C.R. 303<i> </i>at para. 39.  After this, I will balance the considerations
    that emerge to determine an appropriate quantum of support. </p>

    determination of the “condition, means, needs and other circumstances of
    each spouse” includes consideration of the length of the parties’ cohabitation.  The
    Guidelines, which I will discuss later, observe that “in parts of the country
    it is difficult to time-limit support after 15 years of marriage.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  Indeed, in other cases involving lengthy marriages,
    many courts have imposed indefinite orders for support.  See <i>Andrews v.
    Andrews </i>(1999), 50 R.F.L. (4th) 1 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Indefinite support is appropriate after a long-term marriage because
    the dependent spouse is often of an age that makes it difficult to achieve
    economic self-sufficiency.</p>

    though this marriage was lengthy, the trial judge decided that an indefinite
    order was not appropriate.  In making this determination, the trial judge
    considered the appellant’s employment position and relative youth.  For reasons
    that I will expand on later, I see no reason to interfere with the trial
    judge’s determination on this point. </p>

    appellant and the respondent remember their functions during the marriage
    somewhat differently, and the trial judge does not appear to have made a
    factual finding on this issue.  However, even accepting the appellant’s testimony
    that she assumed a somewhat greater proportion of non-economic responsibilities
    during the marriage, the evidence also indicated that the respondent fully
    participated in household chores.  In any event, the appellant does not argue
    that any assumption of household responsibilities<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    court is required, as it did in this case, to consider other factors, including
    the means and needs of the parties.  One important factor in this case is
    the respondent’s responsibility, if any, for his “new” or second family.  The
    appellant does not take issue with the trial judge’s review of the law on
    this point; rather, her concern lies with the application of the law to the
    facts of this case. </p>

    each case, obligations toward second families must be considered in context.  For
    example, where spouses with a child separate, and one remarries and produces
    another child, the obligations to the second child will affect support for
    the first family because the payor has an equal obligation to both children<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

    this case, the respondent voluntarily assumed significant responsibility
    for his second family when he knew, or should have known, of his pre-existing

    second family is capable of contributing to its own support provided <span

    children’s biological father.  This is not a case where the respondent was
    obliged to support his new family, at least beyond the temporary legal obligation
    based on their initial immigration status.  In any event, there was no evidence
    that the respondent’s obligations to his first family would impoverish his
    second family.  In these circumstances, the respondent’s endorsement of his

    the trial judge noted, the appellant’s standard of living was significantly
    reduced when she moved to a small townhouse (a disadvantage also suffered
    by the respondent in view of his similar loss of the matrimonial home and
    the diminution in capital).  Specifically, the trial judge found that the
    appellant “lost not only her future dream and the large financial salary
    increase in which she was led to believe she would share, but she also lost
    the comfortable middle-class lifestyle to which they both had been accustomed.”  (para.
    60)  In addition, the appellant was economically disadvantaged by the reactive
    depression she suffered after the separation.  The resulting interruption
    to her employment reduced her income, at least in the short term. <i></i></p>

    with its connotation of economic independence, is a relative concept.  It
    is not achieved simply because a former spouse can meet basic expenses on
    a particular amount of income; rather, self-sufficiency relates to the ability
    to support a reasonable standard of living.  It is to be assessed in relation
    to the economic partnership the parties enjoyed and could sustain during
    cohabitation, and that they can reasonably anticipate after separation.  See <i>Linton

    ) at 27-28.  Thus, a determination of self-sufficiency requires consideration
    of the parties’ present and potential incomes, their standard of living during
    marriage, the efficacy of any suggested steps to increase a party’s means,
    the parties’ likely post-separation circumstances (including the impact of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Self-sufficiency
    is often more attainable in short-term marriages, particularly ones without
    children, where the lower-income spouse has not become entrenched in a particular
    lifestyle, or compromised career aspirations.  In such circumstances, the
    lower-income spouse is expected either to have the tools to become financially
    independent or to adjust his or her standard of living. </p>

    contrast, in most long-term marriages, particularly in traditional long-term
    ones, the parties’ merger of economic lifestyles creates a joint standard
    of living that the lower-income spouse cannot hope to replicate, but upon
    which he or she has become dependent.  In such circumstances, the spousal
    support analysis typically will not give priority to self-sufficiency because
    it is an objective that simply cannot be attained.  See <i>Linton </i>at

    relevance of standard of living as a measure of dependency in long-term marriages
    is best encapsulated by L’Heureux-Dubé J. in the following passage from <i>Moge</i>: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Although the doctrine
      of spousal support which focuses on equitable sharing does not guarantee

      standard is far from irrelevant to support entitlement (see <i>Mullin v.
      Mullin </i>(1991), <i>supra</i>, and <i>Linton v. Linton</i>, <i>supra</i>).
      Furthermore, great disparities in the standard of living that would be
      experienced by spouses in the absence of support are often a revealing
      indication of the economic disadvantages inherent in the role assumed by
      one party. As marriage should be regarded as a joint endeavour, the longer
      the relationship endures, the closer the economic union, the greater will
      be the presumptive claim to equal standards of living upon its dissolution
      (see Rogerson, “Judicial Interpretation of the Spousal and Child Support

      need more than her $30,000 income to maintain her pre-separation standard
      of living, she would still require support even if that income increased
      to $41,000. Accordingly, the goal of self-sufficiency based on her income-earning

    the review is restricted to a specific issue, it is generally equivalent
    to an initial application for support and necessitates a complete rehearing
    of every issue from entitlement to quantum.  Thus, a review, particularly

    likely to generate similar costs.  For the appellant alone, this expense
    may likely exceed the after-tax value of the support that the trial judge
    ordered for her benefit for the entire year preceding the new application
    ($1,050 monthly).  The concern respecting costs extends equally to the respondent.  It
    is hard to justify such an expense unless it is strongly indicated on the

    orders in effect turn an initial order into a long-term interim order made
    after trial.  Accordingly, they should be the exception, not the norm.  They
    are appropriate when a specified uncertainty about a party’s circumstances
    at the time of trial will become certain within an identifiable timeframe.  When
    one is granted, it should include specifics regarding the issue about which
    there is uncertainty and when and how the trial judge anticipates that uncertainty

    any other case, a trial judge should issue a final order based on a preponderance
    of the evidence called by the parties.  In the family law context, a final
    order will always be subject to variation, which will suffice to protect
    against future events.  A variation is available not only when there is an
    unexpected change in circumstances, but also when an anticipated set of specified
    circumstances fails to materialize.  This is particularly the case where
    an initial order specifies a trial judge’s anticipation that the recipient
    spouse will or should be able to earn a given income within a particular
    timeframe.  This flexibility is to be contrasted with a review order, which
    invariably places the burden on the applicant, albeit in the context of an

    a trial judge concerned about the burden of proof may structure the support
    order either to place the burden on the payor or on the recipient as may
    be appropriate.  This may be achieved by terminating support, so that the
    recipient spouse bears the burden of establishing a material change justifying
    ongoing support, or by ordering indefinite support, so that the payor spouse

    in October 2004, which is when she began her disability leave.  The award

    reasons.  First, as was established at trial, the appellant was in need of
    support and the respondent had the ability to pay.  While the trial judge
    referred to the $12,000 debt the appellant incurred in this period, he saw
    this as offset by the $19,500 of disability insurance.  However, in my view,
    retroactive support to replace an interim support order should not be restricted
    to situations where the recipient spouse has incurred a crippling amount
    of debt.  Rather, retroactive support should be available when the recipient
    establishes at trial that he or she was entitled to a greater amount of interim
    support, the respondent had the ability to pay, and the imposition of retroactive
    support would not create undue hardship for the payor.   </p>

    the interim motion judge limited the amount of interim support partly because
    she was sceptical about the appellant’s reasons for leaving her employment.  However,
    the trial evidence established that the appellant did not wilfully leave
    her employment, but rather, that she was disabled by depression.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span

    lifestyle resulting from the loss of the parties’ combined incomes. </p>

    Guidelines were drafted under the aegis of the federal Department of Justice
    by the highly-regarded family law professors, Carol Rogerson and Rollie Thompson.  The
    objective of the Guidelines is to bring certainty and predictability to spousal
    support awards under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  For this purpose, they employ
    an income-sharing model of support, that if proven viable, will reduce the
    need to rely on the labour-intensive, and thus expensive, budget-based evidence
    employed in a typical case.  In this way, in a manner quite different from
    the Child Support Guidelines (CSGs), the Guidelines aspire to reduce the
    expense of litigation of spousal support by promoting resolution for the
    average case.  </p>

    are neither legislated nor binding; they are only advisory.  The parties,
    their lawyers, and the courts are not required to employ them.  As well,
    the Guidelines continue to evolve; they are a “work in progress” subject

    to initial orders for support and not to variation orders.  They are thus
    prospective in application.  They do not apply in cases where a prior agreement
    provides for support and, obviously, in cases where the requisite entitlement
    has not been established.  They will not help in atypical cases.<a

    as well as rural and urban variations, that may be seen to merit divergent
    results based on variations in cost of living or otherwise.  Importantly,
    in all cases, the reasonableness of an award produced by the Guidelines must
    be balanced in light of the circumstances of the individual case, including
    the particular financial history of the parties during the marriage and their

    turn to the application of the Guidelines.  The “Without Child Support Formula” purports
    to incorporate both compensatory and non-compensatory support objectives
    by focusing on a combination of the difference in the parties’ gross incomes
    and the length of their cohabitation.  This approach is consistent with a
    party’s needs serving as a proxy for dependency.  The formula is set out
    in section 5.1 of the Guidelines:</p>
  <p><b>Amount</b> ranges from 1.5 to 2&nbsp;percent of the difference between
    the spouses’ gross incomes (the <b>gross income difference)</b> for each
    year of marriage, (or, more precisely, years of cohabitation), up to a maximum
    of 50&nbsp;percent. The range remains fixed for marriages 25 years or longer
    at 37.5 to 50&nbsp;percent of income difference.</p>
  <p><b>Duration</b> ranges from .5 to 1 year for each year of marriage.  However
    support will be <b>indefinite</b> if the marriage is <b>20 years or longer</b> in
    duration <i>or</i>, if the marriage has lasted five years or longer, when
    years of marriage and age of the support recipient (at separation) added
    together total 65 or more (the <b>rule of 65</b>).</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Professors Rogerson and Thompson, trial judges and lawyers often overlook
    or ignore the integral component of duration of marriage<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    short-term cohabitation is one of less than five years; a medium-term cohabitation
    is from five to nineteen years and a long-term cohabitation is twenty years
    or longer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    under the Guidelines, a medium-term marriage becomes a long-term one (giving
    rise to indefinite support) if the parties’ years of marriage<a href="#_ftn29"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    the “rule of 65” does not apply in this case, the general principle that
    it adopts in classifying marriage based on a spouse’s age at separation is
    still relevant.  This is because age is a strong indicator of an individual’s

    circumstances such as these, where the marriage falls just outside of the
    Guidelines’ classification of a “long-term” marriage, a court may still decide
    that an indefinite support order is appropriate.  Similarly, a court may
    decide that limited-term support is appropriate even though the period of
    cohabitation is twenty years or more.  This is because, as the Guidelines

    a range of support.  At the low end of the range, the appellant would receive
    28.5% of the parties’ income differential of $54,325, or $1,290 monthly ($15,483
    annually).  At the high end of the Guidelines’ range, the appellant would
    receive 38% of the differential, or $1,720 monthly ($20,644 annually).  In
    accordance with the formula for duration, support would be payable for a
    period ranging from 9.5 to nineteen years.  </p>

    award I consider appropriate in this case, at least initially, both exceeds
    this range for amount and falls below the range for duration.  Thus, I turn
    to the provisions for restructuring, which essentially involve converting
    the specific ranges of support to a lump sum amount (without consideration
    for present values).  In this case, this conversion results in a broad support
    range from a low of $147,088, to a high of $392,236.   </p>
