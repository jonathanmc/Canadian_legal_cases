    In <i>Myers</i>, the court held that trailers, which were occupied year round

    19(1) of the Act<i> </i>provides that “[t]he assessment of land shall be
    based on its current value”. “Current value” is defined in s. 1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“current value” means, in relation to land, the
    amount of money the fee simple, if unencumbered, would realize if sold at
    arm’s length by a willing seller to a willing buyer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “current value” first appeared in the Act in 1997. Prior to that, the
    statute provided that land was to be assessed at its
    “market value”, which was defined as “the amount that the land might be expected
    to realize if sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This

    in the definition of “current value” is at the centre of this case. The parties

    effect of limiting tax assessment to interests owned by the owner of the

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Carsons’ land with sufficient permanency so as to constitute land within
    the expanded definition in s. 1 of the Act. Following <i>Myers</i>, he also
    accepted that the entire value of a parcel of land is to be included in a
    single assessment against the owner of the underlying land, and that the
    Act does not provide for a separate assessment being produced for each trailer
    distinct from the land upon which it is placed or to which it is affixed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    the application judge concluded that the 229 trailers could not be assessed
    and taxed as land because they did not form part of the “fee simple” of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Carsons’ property. He wrote at paras. 61-62:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I ask the question how can the meaning of current
    value, the basis for the assessment include the value of 229 trailers, if
    they are land. They are not part of [the] [f]ee [s]imple. They would not
    be sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer nor would they be part of
    a sale of land, as they are not owned by the seller. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The term “fee simple”
    does not cover moveable trailers owned by third parties. Such being the case,
      they must be classified as chattels, moveable, unless the interpretation
      of the word land, referring to structures i.e. trailers, is extended to
      include such, they being placed there with some degree of permanency. If
      such is the interpretation [then] the definition of current value for the

      at odds with the definition of “land”. The definition of land has not changed
      since 1904 and the value of land for assessment purposes has been based
      on this expanded definition ever since. In the appellants’ view, the application

    being owned by individuals other than the freehold owner. The appellants
    submit that neither the language nor purpose of this amendment indicates
    an intention to alter the law that everything encompassed by the defined

      agree with the appellants’ submissions that nothing on the record before
      us suggests that the legislature intended to change what is to be included
      in the assessed value of land. If
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Carsons’ interpretation is accepted, it  would signal a dramatic change in
    the scope of the Act as it has existed and been applied since 1904 and render
    the expanded statutory definition of land meaningless. If the legislature
    had intended to do so, it would have changed the definition of land in the
    Act to make it coincide with the common law definition of land. The legislature
    did not, and I do not find

    addition, I am not persuaded that the change in 1997 from occupancy-based
    business taxes assessed as against each individual tenant to realty taxes
    payable by the freehold owner is relevant to the present discussion. Business
    occupancy taxes were in no way concerned with ownership of the property or
    the assessed value of the land as a whole; neither is there evidence to indicate
    that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Carsons’ tenants were carrying on businesses from their trailers. I do not

      interpretation advanced by the appellants accords with the modern approach
      to statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Bell ExpressVu
      Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26 quoted
      with approval Professor Driedger’s formulation of the modern approach to
      statutory interpretation:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Today there is only one principle
      or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire
      context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
      scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the change from “market value” to “current value” and the reference
      to
    “fee simple” in the definition of “current value” were not intended to change
    what is to be included in the assessed value. The definition of “current
    value”
    in s. 1 must be read harmoniously in the context of the whole of the Act,<i> </i>the
    object of which is to assess all property in Ontario coming within the expanded
    definition of “land”, “real property” and “real estate”. Similarly, the term “fee
    simple” cannot be isolated from the rest of the definition of “current value”.
    That definition clearly states that it is to be applied “in relation to land”.
    From this contextual perspective, it is apparent that the expression “fee
    simple” was not intended to limit assessment to the “fee simple” interest
    of the freehold owner at common law or as that interest would appear in the
    registry or land titles offices. Rather, the words “fee simple” must be interpreted “in
    relation to” the statutorily broadened definition of “land”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Put
      another way, the Act contemplates identifying what is land according to
      the expanded definition, then assessing the value of the land assuming
      a fee simple ownership interest without encumbrance of all that comes within
      the definition. There are strong policy reasons for interpreting the Act
      in this way. The dominant owner of the freehold is easily identified; there
      is no need to determine the ownership interest in each portion of the broadly
      defined “land”. This approach makes it easier to assess the total value
      of the land, while also preventing manipulation of assessed value by changing
      the ownership of parts of the land. Further, the freehold owner controls
      what is included in the assessed value because the freehold owner controls
      what is placed on the land and on what terms.</span></p>

      intends and desires should pay it. The fact that the tax may be recouped

    the context within which the tax operates as well as the purpose of the tax: <i>Ontario
    Home Builders’ Association</i> at<i> </i>para. 43. Here, the 229 trailers

      is included in the assessed value without regard to the ownership of the

      the statutory basis for the tax on land, defined to include the 229 trailers.
