  <h3><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    framed by the appellant, this appeal raises one issue only:  what is the
    standard of proof to be applied in determining whether an accused has “voluntarily”
    provided a bodily sample for purposes of DNA testing?  Is it proof on a balance
    of probabilities, employing <i>Charter</i> principles, as applied by the
    trial judge in the circumstances of this case?  Or is it proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt, as required by the common law confessions rule, as the appellant contends
    it should be?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with first degree murder.  He was convicted largely
    on the basis of a DNA match between semen found on the victim and a saliva
    sample that he had previously given to the police as part of a post-release
    supervision program for violent offenders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the defence argued that the earlier saliva sample was obtained without
    Mr. Colson’s voluntary and informed consent.  Without objection, Justice
    Archibald applied a balance of probabilities test to that determination.  Since
    the DNA match was the only evidence the Crown had linking Mr. Colson to the
    crime scene, the trial judge’s conclusion that the provision of the earlier
    sample was consensual – and that the DNA results were therefore admissible – was
    pivotal to the appellant’s conviction.  On appeal, the appellant now contends
    that the trial judge applied the wrong test; he submits that proof of voluntariness
    beyond a reasonable doubt is required in cases involving the provision of
    bodily samples, just as it is in the case of confessions, because both confessions
    and bodily samples constitute conscriptive evidence and accordingly raise
    the same trial fairness issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant rests his appeal on the common law.  He does not quarrel with the
    trial judge’s analysis, refusing to exclude the bodily sample evidence under
    the <i>Charter</i>, or with the application of the balance of probabilities
    standard of proof in that context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Luzmila
    Contreras, a paralegal, was murdered on July 31, 1999.  Her body was discovered
    in her office premises on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Bloor Street near
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Walmer Road in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The appellant had worked with his uncle for a period of time in
    an adjoining apartment complex on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Walmer Road.  It was the Crown’s theory that the appellant had caused the
    death of Ms. Contreras while sexually assaulting her.  Hence the charge of
    first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had previously been convicted of sexual assault, forcible confinement
    and assault police.  He served a four-year and five-month term of imprisonment
    at the Special Handling Unit of the Quebec Penitentiary north of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Montreal and was released on November 3, 1998.  His original plan had been
    to return to his native
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Newfoundland upon the expiry of his sentence.  When he learned that the Royal
    Newfoundland Constabulary planned to issue a community notification publicizing
    his name and profile in his hometown, however, he concluded it would be virtually
    impossible for him to live there and decided to come to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto instead.  The appellant had relatives living in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  He and his family hoped that he would be able to live with his
    grandfather or his uncle and that his uncle would be able to provide some
    employment for him as a handyman.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto police were interested to learn about the appellant’s plans to live
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto, however.  They contacted him prior to his release from penitentiary
    and met him at the bus terminal upon his arrival in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto on November 3, 1998.  He was taken to police headquarters by Detectives
    Lobsinger and Barsky – who worked in the police unit supervising high risk
    offenders upon their release from prison – and was interviewed, in the presence
    of his uncle, about entering into a recognizance under s. 810.2 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  This provision permits police to apply to an Ontario Court Judge
    for a recognizance with terms against individuals the police fear on reasonable
    grounds may commit serious personal injury offences while living in the community.  As
    the trial judge noted, “[t]he 810.2 recognizance mechanism was used for the
    purpose of attempting to reintegrate high-risk offenders into the community”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    days later, the appellant appeared before a judge and entered into a s. 810.2
    recognizance providing (a) that he attend at the Clarke Institute for counselling,
    therapy or treatment as directed, and (b) that he enter into a programme
    of regular polygraph examinations for the purpose of monitoring and managing
    his sexual behaviour.  Duty counsel made submissions on his behalf regarding
    the validity of the polygraph provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complied with this program over the following months, developing
    a cordial relationship with Detectives Lobsinger and Barsky in the process.  He
    was interviewed by the head of the Sexual Behaviour Clinic at the Clarke
    Institute and he submitted to a polygraph interview (the detective who conducted
    the interview confided to Detectives Lobsinger and Barsky that he felt the
    appellant had “failed” the polygraph test).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 28, 1999, however, an event occurred that would be critical to the
    resolution of the subsequent homicide of Ms. Contreras six months later.  A
    tenant in the apartment building at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    7 Walmer Road complained that the appellant had sexually assaulted her.  Although
    Detectives Lobsinger and Barsky concluded they did not have reasonable grounds
    to arrest Mr. Colson in connection with this incident, and no charges were
    ultimately laid as a result, they interviewed the appellant on videotape
    nonetheless.  During this lengthy interview on January 28 he made statements,
    and provided the saliva sample, which became the subject of a blended <i>voir
    dire</i> at the subsequent Contreras murder trial before Archibald J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were numerous exchanges between Detective Lobsinger and the appellant during
    the course of the January 28 interview during which the request for a saliva
    sample and the reasons for it were discussed.  That Mr. Colson was well aware
    of the reasons for the request and the potential uses for the sample, and
    – in the trial judge’s view – that he voluntarily consented to providing
    the sample, is reflected in the following passage:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  …
    Um, I talked to you about giving me a DNA sample.  I told you my whole purpose
    of the DNA sample is if I have your DNA on file, and there’s any sexual assaults
    in the future, that I believe that could have been committed by you, I’d
    like to be able to take that, have a scientist look at that and say, no that’s
    not Jason Colson, or, yes, that is Jason Colson.  Because it doesn’t lie.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  I hear you.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  There’s no error there.  I told you
    that.  Do you understand that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  Yes I do.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  What do you think that I want this
    DNA sample for?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  You want this DNA to log and record what
    my DNA genetic make up or fingerprint so called fingerprint is so that if
    any sexual assaults occur in the future from this present time on, that if
    there is any DNA evidence left at the scene of the crime or on the person,
    the victim, then if there is, then it can be cross referenced and see whether
    it is a match or not a match.  To eliminate or to implement me, in a crime
    that has to do.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  Eliminate or implicate</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  Exactly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  Do you have any trouble with that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  No I don’t.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  Do you understand that I have no authority
    whatsoever to make you do that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  I understand.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  None whatsoever.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  I have nothing in law that will stand
    up to allow me to say Jason you do this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  I understand that.  I’m voluntarily submitting
    the sample for the purposes set out, already mentioned.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lobsinger:  Can you think of any other purpose?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Colson:  No, I can’t.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s life was deteriorating by the Spring of 1999.  He submitted to
    two further polygraph tests, with similar results.  He went from living with
    his uncle to living with his grandfather, then to living in hostels.  He
    was unemployed and his conduct became more erratic.  He was arrested on May
    6, 1999 on unrelated matters and was released from custody on July 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Contreras was murdered on July 31, 1999, in her office premises at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    360 Bloor Street, a building attached to the building at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    7 Walmer Road mentioned above.  On November 29, 1999, after samples taken
    from the body of Ms. Contreras were found to be similar to the DNA sample
    taken from the saliva provided by the appellant to the police on January
    28<sup>th</sup>, the appellant was arrested for first degree murder.  In
    February, 2000, the appellant provided a further blood sample pursuant to
    a <i>Criminal Code</i> DNA warrant executed while he was in custody.  This
    sample resulted in a match as well.</p>
  <h3>The Trial Judge’s Rulings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the defence argued that Mr. Colson had been detained on January 28,
    and attacked both the voluntariness of the statements made by the appellant
    during the interview on that date (on the basis that they were the product
    of a coerced therapeutic relationship) and the admissibility of the bodily
    saliva sample provided (on the basis that the sample was acquired without
    the appellant’s consent and obtained involuntarily in violation of ss. 7,
    8 and 10 the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>).  There was a blended <i>voir
    dire</i> to determine these issues.  Only the admissibility of the bodily
    saliva sample, and the DNA test results flowing from it, is raised on this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a thorough decision the trial judge ruled that the appellant had not been
    physically or psychologically detained and <i>–</i> after examining the evidence
    relating to thirty-nine examples of alleged <i>Charter</i> breaches advanced
    by the defence as undermining the admissibility of the utterances and the
    saliva sample – that both the utterances and saliva sample were admissible.  The
    trial judge found that the appellant was motivated to agree to the s. 810.2
    order and the programme that followed by his own self-interest and by his
    desire to reintegrate into society, straighten out his life, and not end
    up in jail again.  He concluded (1) that the relationship between the appellant
    and the police was not based upon oppression, fear or coercion, but rather
    was “one based upon cordiality and informality”; (2) that the appellant was
    not detained by the police during the interview on January 28, 1999; (3)
    that the appellant’s rights were not infringed during the course of the interview;
    (4) that the utterances made by the appellant at that time were voluntary;
    and, (5) that the appellant consented to providing his saliva sample.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified on the <i>voir dire</i>.  The trial judge rejected his
    evidence on key points and preferred that of the police and other witnesses
    in cases of conflict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the issue that is the subject matter of this appeal, the trial
    judge found that Mr. Colson gave an informed, express and voluntary consent
    to the taking of the saliva sample.  He concluded, based on this Court’s
    decision in <i>R v. Wills</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 59 at 546-547, that
    the burden was on the Crown to establish these factors on  a balance of probabilities.  Applying
    that standard, the trial judge found that the appellant’s donation of the
    saliva sample “was valid, informed, voluntary and express.”  In particular,
    he found that the donation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    made voluntarily in the sense that it was the product of his own consent,
    given for reasons that he considered sufficient, and not the product of police
    coercion or oppression or other external conduct negating his freedom of
    choice; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    made knowingly in the sense that Mr. Colson was aware of what he was doing
    and of the significance of his act and of the use to which the police would
    be able to make of the consent.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal is based upon the common law, not the <i>Charter</i>.  Mr. Calarco
    made that clear.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    submits that the appellant gave the January 28<sup>th</sup> saliva sample
    without a proper common law waiver of rights, or, more precisely, that the
    trial judge failed to apply the appropriate standard of proof in determining
    whether a proper waiver, in the form of a voluntary and informed consent,
    had been provided.  Without objection from defence counsel (not Mr. Calarco),
    the trial judge simply applied the <i>Wills</i> test, which expressly adopts
    a balance of probabilities standard for determining whether an accused has
    waived his or her <i>Charter</i> rights.  Here, however, the issue raised
    by the appellant is whether, <i>at common law</i>, the test for waiver – that
    is, the provision of a voluntary and informed consent to the giving of the
    bodily sample – is based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Mr. Calarco, the Crown must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that
    there was a proper common law waiver of rights with respect to the giving
    of the bodily sample, just as it must do under the common law confessions
    rule.  This is so, he submits, because the giving of a bodily sample should
    be treated no differently than the giving of a statement at common law.  Both
    are “conscriptive” forms of evidence that, if admitted when illegally obtained,
    tend to undermine the overarching principles of trial fairness and the right
    to protection against self-incrimination.  Accordingly, the Crown’s burden
    of proving voluntariness and consent in each case should be the same, he
    contends.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    are not in agreement as to whether this issue was raised at trial.  Ms. Wheeler,
    for the Crown, submits it was not.  I am satisfied, upon reviewing the transcripts,
    that if the issue were raised at trial it was done in only the most tangential
    fashion.  The case was put to the trial judge on the <i>voir dire</i> as
    in substance a s. 7, s. 8 and s. 10 <i>Charter</i> case.  That said, however,
    I see no prejudice to the Crown in dealing with the argument now put forward
    on behalf of the appellant, which was fully and capably presented on both
    sides before us.  There is no suggestion that the record would have been
    developed differently had the Crown understood the defence to be asserting
    a criminal standard of proof.  Indeed, Ms. Wheeler argues that the record
    amply supports a finding that the saliva sample was provided voluntarily
    and on consent even applying that higher standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    consent seizure is one that is not only voluntary but also informed.  The
    appellant accepts that where a <i>Charter</i> breach is alleged the standard
    of proof is the civil balance of probabilities.  The law in this respect
    was set out by Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Wills</i>, <i>supra</i> – a s. 8
    case involving the taking of a breath sample for breathalyser purposes – at
    546-547:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the application of the waiver doctrine
    to situations where it is said that a person has consented to what would
    otherwise be an unauthorized search or seizure requires that the Crown establish
    on the balance of probabilities that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was a consent, express or implied;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    giver of the consent had the authority to give the

    coercion or other external conduct which negated the freedom to choose whether

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the

    were infringed by the trial judge’s failure to apply a reasonable doubt standard
    to the assessment of voluntary and informed consent.  Put generally, as I

    fairness, including the elemental right to protection against self-incrimination – both
    principles of fundamental justice
    – are now the overarching considerations respecting the exclusion of illegally
    obtained evidence, both under the <i>Charter</i> and at common law; judges
    are now required to exclude evidence if its admission would adversely affect
    the fairness of the trial (<i>R. v.</i> <i>Seaboyer</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C.

    if relevant, was generally admissible and that a trial judge had little discretion

    the <i>Charter</i> does not abrogate common law rights, the latter must be
    interpreted consistent with <i>Charter</i> principles (<i>R v. Salituro</i> (1991),
    68 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at 305), and one of those important <i>Charter</i> principles
    is that both statements and bodily samples are
    “conscriptive” evidence (<i>i.e.</i>, evidence that would not exist but for
    the state co-opting the accused to provide the evidence himself or herself)
    tending to undermine trial fairness (<i>R. v. Stillman </i>(1997), 113 C.C.C.

    pre-<i>Charter</i> Canadian authority may provide otherwise (based on
    “reliability” considerations), those authorities have been overtaken (i)
    by Cory J’s equation of the two as “conscriptive” in <i>Stillman</i>, and
    (ii) by the evolution of the common law rationale for the confessions rule
    from one based upon reliability to one based upon trial fairness;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>h)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>accordingly,
    the taking of bodily samples and the giving of a statement are to be treated
    equally, in terms of the standard of proof, when determining voluntariness

    confessions rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge a certain analytical attraction to this argument at one level.  In
    the end, however, I would not give effect to it.  I say this for several
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I do not accept that the common law with respect to the giving of bodily
    samples has developed to the point where Mr. Calarco seeks to place it, namely,
    to the point where it parallels the common law confessions rule in terms
    of the standard of proof.  Nor should it, in my view.  Why?  Because reliability
    remains an important element in the evidentiary exclusion/admission exercise,
    and there are significant differences in that regard between the two types
    of evidence.  Nor do I accept, as Mr. Calarco asserts, that the courts have
    jettisoned reliability as a part of the rationale for the common law confessions
    rule.  Finally, I can see no policy reason or justification for extending
    the common law rule in the fashion sought by the appellant.  It is not necessary
    to equate the standards of proof in order to accommodate the process concerns
    that underlie the modern emphasis on trial fairness.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Evolution of the Common Law Confessions
        rule</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let
    me deal with the underpinnings of the common law confessions rule first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Calarco submits that this rule has evolved to the point where it is no longer
    concerned with reliability as an underlying rationale, but only with trial
    fairness and protection against self-incrimination.  This contention is important
    to the development of the appellant’s argument because there is a line of
    Canadian authority – alluded to above, and to which I will turn shortly – drawing
    a clear distinction for purposes of admissibility between the making of a
    statement (which raises serious “reliability” concerns when made to a person
    in authority) and the taking of bodily samples (which gives rise to very
    few worries about “reliability”, particularly in the DNA context).  The contention
    is also important because Mr. Calarco seeks to transport the notions of trial
    fairness and protection against self-incrimination – which underlie the <i>Charter</i> analysis
    equating bodily samples and statements as “conscriptive” evidence – to the
    common law context relating to the taking of bodily samples.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that in cases such as <i>R</i>.<i> v. Hebert </i>(1990), 57 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1, <i>R. v. Hodgson</i> (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at paras. 18-24,
    and <i>R. v. Oickle</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 321, the Supreme Court of
    Canada has developed an enhanced rationale for the common law confessions
    rule in the <i>Charter</i> era, emphasizing that “the confessions rule also
    extends to protect a broader conception of voluntariness
    ‘that focuses on the protection of the accused’s rights and fairness in the
    criminal process’”: <i>Oickle</i>, at para 69. [Citation omitted.]  See also, <i>R.
    v. Sweeney</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 321 (
    <st1:country-region

    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    reliability issues remain a principal concern.  As Iacobucci J. noted in <i>Oickle</i>,
    at paras. 32 and 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[32] … [T]he confessions rule is concerned with
    voluntariness, broadly defined.  One of the <i>predominate</i> <i>reasons</i> for
    this concern is that involuntary confessions are <i>more likely to be unreliable</i>.  The
    confessions rule should recognize which interrogation techniques commonly
    produce false confessions … [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[47] The common law confessions rule is well-suited
    to protect against false confessions.  While its overriding concern is with <i>voluntariness</i>,
    this concept overlaps with reliability.  A confession that is not voluntary
    will often (though not always) be unreliable. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view is reinforced in <i>R v. Singh</i> [2007] S.C.J. No. 48, the latest
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with the right to silence
    and the voluntariness of statements.  Writing for the majority, Charron J.
    said, at paras. 29-30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, the information obtained from a suspect
    is only useful in the elucidation of crime if it can be relied upon for its
    truth – <i>hence the primary reason for the confessions rule,</i> <i>the
    concern about the reliability of confessions</i>.  The common law confessions
    rule is largely informed by the problem of false confessions. … One of the
    overriding concerns of the criminal justice system is that the innocent must
    not be convicted.  <i>Because it is recognized that involuntary confessions
    are more likely to be unreliable, the confessions rule requires proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt of the voluntariness of any statement obtained from an
    accused by a person in authority</i> before it may be admitted in evidence,
    so to avoid miscarriages of justice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, not every involuntary confession is
    false. <i> While the confessions rule’s primary concern is with reliability</i>,
    it is well established that voluntariness is a broader concept.  As this
    Court stated in <i>Oickle</i> (at para. 70): “Wigmore perhaps summed up the
    point best when he said that voluntariness is ‘shorthand for a complex of
    values’: <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i> (Chadbourn rev. 1970), vol. 3, <span style='font-family:Sylfaen'>§</span> 826,
    at p. 351.”  These values include respect for the <u>individual’s freedom
    of will</u>, the need for law enforcement officers themselves to obey the
    law, and the overall fairness of the criminal justice system: see <i>Oickle</i>,
    at paras. 69-70, citing <i>Blackburn v. Alabama</i>, 361 U.S. 199 (1960),
    at p. 207.</p>

      Fish dissented in <i>Singh</i>.  He nonetheless confirmed the continued
      relevance of reliability issues to the common law confessions rule, stating
      at para. 76:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Even under its broader formulation

      while reliability is no longer recognized as the <i>sole</i> rationale
      underlying the common law confessions rule, it remains one of its essential
      underpinnings.<i>  </i>In my view, this undercuts the appellant’s submission
      that the taking of bodily samples should be treated analogously to confessions
      at common law.  Reliability is not a concern with respect to bodily samples,
      particularly DNA results taken from a bodily sample of saliva.  Indeed,
      reliability is the hallmark of properly introduced DNA testing.  Thus,
      there remains an important distinction between the admissibility of DNA
      results taken from a bodily saliva sample and a confession, notwithstanding
      that both are considered to be conscriptive evidence under s. 24(2) of
      the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Although that was a case [<i>Begin</i>]
      where the accused consented to a blood test, it was urged unsuccessfully

    is thus binding authority at common law – I remind the reader that the appellant’s
    case is based upon common law principles rather than the <i>Charter</i> – to
    the effect that bodily samples and the results of physical tests are not
    to be treated in the same fashion as statements because the rationale behind
    the confessions rule only applies to statements. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I see no policy reason or justification for extending the standard of proof
    under the common law confessions rule to the common law treatment of the
    taking of bodily samples in the <i>Charter</i> era.  I say this primarily
    because of the differing reliability concerns underlying the two approaches
    and because there is an already well-developed <i>Charter</i> landscape for
    determining whether improperly obtained evidence should or should not be
    excluded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    a more general level, however, I see no justification for creating a <i>new</i> common
    law right – infused, the argument goes, by the <i>Charter</i> tool of equating
    bodily samples and statements as
    “conscriptive evidence” and by the now <i>Charter</i>-guaranteed fundamental
    principles of trial fairness and protection against self-incrimination – that
    would provide greater protection to an accused than the <i>Charter</i> safeguards
    he agrees have been properly applied in the circumstances of this case.  The
    appellant would derive greater protection because, under the proposed common
    law principle, the bodily samples would be automatically excluded from evidence
    unless the Crown could demonstrate a voluntary and informed waiver or consent
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  Under the <i>Charter</i>, on the other hand,
    the <i>Wills</i> waiver need only be established by the Crown on a balance
    of probabilities.  In short, the appellant invokes the <i>Charter</i>, and <i>Charter</i>-related
    values, to push the common law to the desired point, then invokes the common
    law (devoid of the <i>Charter</i>) to achieve the more advantageous legal
    result that he seeks.  This approach makes no sense, particularly where,
    as I have noted above, there is no need for it, given the well-developed <i>Charter</i> jurisprudence
    respecting trial fairness and its included values in the context of improperly
    obtained evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Calarco is quite right in asserting that the common law exclusionary rules
    have outstripped <i>Wray</i> and have developed to the point where the trial
    judge has a broad discretion to exclude improperly obtained evidence where
    its admission would adversely affect and undermine the fairness of an accused’s
    trial, including adversely affecting the right to silence and the right to
    be protected against self-incrimination:  see <i>R. v. Seaboyer, supra</i>,
    at 390-391; <i>R. v. Harrer, supra</i>, at paras. 21-24 and 41-49.  Moreover,
    careful scrutiny of the process of gathering evidence is obviously important,
    and the sanction of exclusion justified, where to admit improperly obtained
    evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I also
    accept that, for purposes of <i>Charter</i> analysis respecting the exclusion
    of evidence, bodily samples and statements are both treated as “conscriptive”.  As
    well, as Justice Iacobucci observed in <i>Oickle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    31, the common law
    “can offer protections beyond those guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>”, and,
    as he also said in <i>R v. Salituro</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 305, “where
    the principles underlying a common law rule are out of step with the values
    enshrined in the <i>Charter</i>, the courts should scrutinize the rule closely.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    however, the principles underlying the common law approach to distinguishing
    between bodily samples and statements – at least in terms of the standard
    of proof necessary to determine exclusion or admission –
    remain sound.  Statements given to persons in authority are notoriously unreliable
    if their voluntariness, in the sense of their freedom from inducement or
    threat, is not assured.  Different considerations arise with respect to the
    voluntariness of a waiver or consent to provide bodily samples, however,
    and with respect to the exclusion of test results emanating from those samples,
    which are not fraught with the same frailties.  </p>

    consideration in preserving the values of trial fairness and protection against
    self-incrimination.  That is at least part of the rationale for equating
    bodily samples and statements as conscriptive evidence for <i>Charter</i> purposes.  Process,
    however, is a factor to be weighed in the exercise of determining the voluntary
    and informed nature of the consent or waiver given by an accused when the
    bodily sample is provided.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
    should a high standard of proof be required to cross the admissibility threshold
    where there is a high degree of reliability in the evidence tendered?  In
    my view, the <i>Wills</i> test – including the balance of probabilities standard – adequately
    addresses the underlying core concerns of the criminal law in such circumstances.  DNA
    samples, for example, do not bring with them the unease associated with potential
    wrongful convictions, whereas false confessions do and the common law confessions
    rule reflects that danger.  <i>Wills</i> also directs trial judges to be
    alert to issues going to abuse of process and interference with individual
    autonomy (for example, police oppression, coercion or other external conduct
    negating freedom of choice).  On the other side of the scale, <i>Wills</i> balances
    the need of the state to investigate and solve crimes, a factor that speaks
    in favour of the less stringent standard of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case involves the taking of bodily samples.  We are not concerned, therefore,
    with whether or not an <i>existing</i> common law principle may provide additional
    protection to the accused “beyond those guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>”.  Instead,
    we are asked to develop a <i>new</i> common law principle – and to do so
    using the bricks and mortar of <i>Charter</i> analysis – and then to provide
    that new principle to afford protections beyond those afforded by the <i>Charter</i>.  On
    behalf of the Crown, Ms. Wheeler argues there is no need for such a development.  I
    agree.  The underlying criminal law policy concerns – wrongful convictions,
    abuse of police power and coerced self-incrimination, and respect for human
    choice and autonomy – are all adequately preserved and accommodated through
    the <i>Charter</i> regime.  A new common law regime is not required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    conclude, therefore, that the trial judge applied the correct standard of
    proof in determining that Mr. Colson voluntarily consented to providing his
    saliva sample to the police and in refusing to exclude the sample, and the
    DNA results flowing from it, from evidence.  This is so whether the determination
    is made under the common law or the <i>Charter</i>.  The standard is the
    same, namely, whether the Crown has established, on the balance of probabilities,
    that the appellant voluntarily consented to the giving of the sample.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Other Issues</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of these conclusions, the DNA results emanating from the second bodily
    sample provided pursuant to the <i>Criminal Code</i> DNA warrant were also
    properly admitted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    it is not necessary to deal with the question whether, had he applied the
    higher standard of proof, the trial judge would or would not have come to
    the same conclusion about the admissibility of the saliva sample.  I observe
    only that he appears to have exhibited few doubts in making the findings
    he made.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, therefore, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
