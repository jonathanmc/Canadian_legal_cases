      April 8, 2004, Constable David Isaacs was working as a member of the uniform
      patrol assigned to the Regional Traffic Unit of the Peel Regional Police.  A
      provincial seat belt campaign was being conducted throughout April 2004

    Brampton.  At 8:17 a.m., he observed the vehicle driven by the respondent
    stop at the intersection.  He saw three people in the vehicle – a male driver,
    a child in the front passenger seat, and another child in a rear seat.  Constable
    Isaacs observed the child in the back seat sitting forward, leaning against
    the back of the driver’s seat.  Constable Isaacs concluded that the child
    was not wearing a seat belt.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This
      appeal is governed almost entirely by the well-known decision of the Supreme
      Court of Canada in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>.  In that case, Dickson J. divided “regulatory”
    or “public welfare” offences into three categories – <i>mens rea</i> offences,
    strict liability offences and absolute liability offences.  He defined them,
    respectively, in this fashion at pp. 373-74:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Offences in which <i>mens rea</i>, consisting of some positive state
      of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the
      prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act committed,
      or by additional evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Offences in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove
      the existence of <i>mens rea</i>; the doing of the prohibited act <i>prima
      facie</i> imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid
      liability by proving that he took all reasonable care.  This involves consideration
      of what a reasonable man would have done in the circumstances.  The defence
      will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set
      of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or
      if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.  These offences
      may properly be called offences of strict liability. …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Offences of absolute liability where it is not open to the accused
      to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Justice
      Dickson continued with a discussion of how to differentiate among the three
      categories of regulatory offences.  He stated at p. 374:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>Offences which are criminal in
      the true sense fall in the first category.  Public welfare offences would, <i>prima
      facie</i>, be in the second category.  They are not subject to the presumption
      of full <i>mens rea</i>.  An offence of this type would fall in the first
      category only if such words as “wilfully”, “with intent”, “knowingly”,
      or
    “intentionally” are contained in the statutory provision creating the offence.  On
    the other hand, the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted
    on those without fault applies.  Offences of absolute liability would be
    those in respect of which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would
    follow proof merely of the proscribed act.  <i>The over-all regulatory pattern
    adopted by the Legislature, the subject-matter of the legislation, the importance
    of the penalty, and the precision of the language used will be primary considerations
    in determining whether the offence falls into the third category</i>.        [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I
      make two observations about this passage.  First, Dickson J. articulated
      a presumption that public welfare offences are strict liability offences;
      accordingly, this presumption must be the starting point in an analysis
      of a regulatory provision such as s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i>.  Second,
      the classification of a particular provision follows from an assessment
      of the four factors set out in the emphasized portion of the passage – the
      overall regulatory pattern, the subject matter, the penalty, and the precision
      of the language used.  It is to this assessment that I now turn.</span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-GB>Overall regulatory pattern</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Section
      106(6) is found in Part VI of the <i>HTA</i>.  Part VI, comprising ss.
      61-107, bears the heading “Equipment” and deals with the various duties
      imposed upon drivers in the operation of motor vehicles.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The <i>HTA</i>,
      including Part VI of the Act, creates many offences.  Importantly, throughout

      draw two conclusions about the offences established by the <i>HTA</i>,
      including <i>Part VI –
    Equipment</i>.  First, the language necessary to clearly demonstrate an intention
    to create <i>mens rea</i>, strict liability and absolute liability offences
    is well-known to the legislature and has been employed to create all three
    types of offences in the <i>HTA</i>.  Second, as acknowledged by counsel
    for the Attorney General in oral argument, the <i>HTA</i> has many strict
    liability offences: see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R. v.

  <h3><u><span lang=EN-GB>Subject Matter</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Section
      106 of the <i>HTA</i> requires most people riding in motor vehicles to
      wear seat belts.  The “important statutory purpose” of the seat belt law
      is “minimizing driver and passenger injuries resulting from car collisions”:
      see
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <i>York</i><i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Municipality) v. Tassone</i>, 2007 ONCA 215 at para. 8.  Subsection 106(6)
    of the <i>HTA</i> advances this purpose by making drivers responsible for
    ensuring that all passengers under 16 years of age use seat belts.  The provision
    is clearly intended to ensure the safety of vulnerable youthful passengers
    who cannot be relied upon to take responsibility for their own safety.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      above description of s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> might support its classification
      as an absolute liability offence.  However, there are countervailing points
      relating to the subject matter of the provision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First,
      the link between absolute liability and increased compliance with the law
      is tenuous.  As explained by Dickson J. in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at 363:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>There is no evidence that a higher
      standard of care results from absolute liability.  If a person is already
      taking every reasonable precautionary measure, is he likely to take additional
      measures, knowing that however much care he takes, it will not serve as
      a defence in the event of breach?  If he has exercised care and skill,
      will conviction have a deterrent effect upon him or others?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Second,
      the argument that the important public purposes of a law (i.e., child safety)
      are promoted by easy and efficient enforcement that supposedly flows from
      absolute liability offences has little bearing on the question of statutory
      interpretation.  As expressed by Dickson J. in <i>R. v. Chapin</i> (1979),
      45 C.C.C. (2d) 333 at 342 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>[T]he problems that may be encountered
      in the administration of a statute or regulation are a very unsure guide
      to its proper interpretation.  Difficulty of enforcement is hardly enough
      to dislodge the offence from the category of strict liability….</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover,
      to regard strict liability as a serious diminution of enforcement capacity
      is a misconception.  Strict liability is what its name implies – a serious
      commitment to enforcement of the law.  In most cases, if a person commits
      the act proscribed by the law a conviction will follow because establishing
      the defence of due diligence or reasonable care will not be easy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In
      my view, the subject matter of s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> supports a classification
      of the offence as strict liability.  This classification strikes an appropriate
      balance between encouraging drivers to be vigilant about the safety of
      child passengers in their vehicles and not punishing those who exercise
      due diligence with respect to children’s seat belts.</span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-GB>Penalty</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      only penalty available for failing to comply with s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> is
      a relatively modest fine.  Since the <i>HTA</i> does not specify a penalty
      for violations of s. 106(6), the general penalty provision in s. 214(1)
      applies, namely, “a fine of not less than $60 and not more than $500”.  In
      addition, a driver convicted under s. 106(6) receives two demerit points
      which is well short of the nine demerit points required for the suspension
      of a driver’s licence.  Finally, violating s. 106(6) cannot result in imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover,
      I note that in <i>R. v. Kurtzman</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 172
      (Ont. C.A.), this court observed that “there is today little, if any, stigma
      attached to a violation of Highway Traffic Act provisions governing compliance
      with traffic signal indicators.”  By parity of reasoning, the same point
      could be made about the stigma attached to a violation of s. 106(6) of
      the <i>HTA</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly,
      the penalties relating to s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> are consistent with
      a classification of absolute liability.  </span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-GB>Precision of language</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As
      discussed previously, the <i>HTA</i> explicitly creates offences in all
      three categories of regulatory offences.  Subsection 106(6) does not contain
      the triggering language that would make classification virtually automatic.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      appellant and the intervener submit that the triggering words of s. 106(6) –
    “No person shall” – evince a clear intention to create an absolute liability
    offence.  For several reasons, I disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First,
      the case law does not support the proposition that the language “no person
      shall” points to absolute liability.  The provision of the <i>Migratory
      Birds Regulations</i>, S.O.R./71-376, in issue in <i>Chapin</i> employed
      this language and was determined by the Supreme Court of Canada to create
      a strict liability offence.  Likewise, in <i>Nickel City Transport</i>,<i> supra</i>,
      at 556, a case involving an <i>HTA</i> offence, this court stated that “the
      language of ‘no operator <i>shall’</i>, does not import absolute liability” [emphasis
      in original].</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It
      is true that some offences employing the “no person shall” or “every driver
      shall” formulation­ have been interpreted as absolute liability offences:
      see <i>Kurtzman</i>, <i>supra</i> (failing to stop at a red light) and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>London</i><i> (City) v. Polewsky</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (speeding).  However, in those cases the proscribed conduct resulted directly
    from the person’s own action.  Section 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i>, on the other
    hand, deals with a situation in which another person – the child passenger – is
    potentially involved in creating the violation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Second,
      s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> does not expressly exclude the defence of due
      diligence.  The language of absolute liability is well-known and has been
      used by the legislature in the <i>HTA</i> in s. 84.1.  If the legislature
      wanted to impose the serious consequences that flow from the creation of
      an absolute liability offence, the means for so doing would have been known
      and available.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Third,
      I am attracted to the logic of the interpretation of s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> proposed
      in paragraph 8 of <i>amicus curiae’s</i> factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>Where the section in essence creates
      an offence of failing to meet a standard or duty of care (the Appellant
      refers to it as a standard of vigilance – see paragraph 26 of the Appellant’s
      factum), in respect of another person, it is counterintuitive to suggest
      that the defendant cannot raise a defence of due diligence or reasonable
      care.</span></p>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-GB>Conclusion</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[42]<span

lang=EN-GB>Sault Ste. Marie</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> established the framework for classifying regulatory offences.  The
      three categories of such offences, their definitions and differences, have
      stood for thirty years and were explicitly affirmed in <i>L</i></span><i>é</i><i><span lang=EN-GB>vis
      (City) v. Tétreault</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      second important feature of <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> is its strong presumption
      in favour of strict liability in an interpretive contest between strict
      and absolute liability.  This presumption has also been affirmed in subsequent
      case law, including <i>Chapin</i> and <i>Tétreault</i>, and deepened by
      the Supreme Court’s post-<i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> declaration that coupling
      absolute liability offences with the punishment of imprisonment violates
      s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>: see <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985]
      2 S.C.R. 486.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Against
      this backdrop, my application of the four factors from <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> leads
      to the conclusion that the appellant and the intervener have not displaced
      the presumption in favour of strict liability.  The overall regulatory
      scheme of the <i>HTA</i>, including Part VI, is neutral; all three categories
      of offences are contained therein.  The subject matter of s. 106 tells
      in favour of strict liability.  As discussed above, the classification
      of strict liability strikes an appropriate balance between encouraging
      drivers to be vigilant about the safety of child passengers in their vehicles
      and not punishing those who exercise due diligence with respect to children’s
      seat belts.  The minor penalty points towards absolute liability.  Finally,
      the wording of s. 106(6) of the <i>HTA</i> suggests that it established
      a strict liability offence.</span></p>
