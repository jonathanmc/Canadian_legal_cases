  <h3>A. <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case deals with a child who, at a very young age, was wrongfully retained
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and with the Hague Convention on international child abduction, which
    governs such retentions. The chief question is whether the father, who stayed
    in Florida while his wife took the child to Ontario, acquiesced in the retention
    and should therefore be denied his son’s summary return under the Hague Convention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the father had acquiesced, emphasizing his delay
    in filing his Hague Convention application for his son’s summary return.
    During the eight-month period between the child’s retention and the father’s
    Hague Convention application, the father consented to a hearing in Ontario
    on whether Ontario or Florida was the proper jurisdiction to hear a custody
    application, and did not begin his Hague Convention application until the
    day before that hearing was scheduled to be held. Relying on the father’s
    acquiescence, the motion judge declined to order the child’s return under
    the Hague Convention.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father appeals, arguing that he did not acquiesce and seeking an order for
    his son’s return. For the reasons that follow, I would allow his appeal.  </p>
  <h3>B. <u>FACTS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant (the father) and the respondent (the mother) were married in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida on July 29, 2004. A year later, on July 20, 2005, in

    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Pensacola,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida, the mother gave birth to their first and only child, Andrew Girgis. </p>

    the father nor the mother is a citizen or a permanent resident of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    . The father is a Jordanian citizen and has lived in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    since 2001. During the time Andrew lived in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida, the father resided in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    on a temporary work permit. He has since been granted asylum status in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    . The mother is a citizen of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , and lived in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario from 1991 until her marriage in 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Andrew

    citizen and holds a social security card. He lived in

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida continuously from his birth until just before his first birthday. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s grandmother, who was very dear to the mother, was terminally ill.
    The mother decided to visit her grandmother in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, and to bring Andrew, who had never met his great-grandmother. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother was uncertain whether she would be allowed back into the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    if she went to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Accordingly, the mother wrote a letter dated February 2, 2006 to the member
    of Congress in the area where she resided asking permission to leave the
    country. In March 2006, she applied to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    immigration officials for a travel document granting her permission to re-enter
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    . By June, however, she still had received no response from either the congressman
    or
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    immigration, and her grandmother’s health was deteriorating. On June 11,
    2006, she boarded a plane for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, still having received no permission from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    officials. Her ticket, purchased by the father, had a return date of September
    29, 2006. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    late September, a dispute had arisen between the father and the mother. The
    mother said she wished to remain with Andrew in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. The father and mother also seem to have disagreed over whether immigration
    officials would allow the mother to return to the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    . September 29, the date of the return ticket, came and went. Neither the
    mother nor Andrew boarded the plane. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties offer different accounts about what occurred over the ensuing months.
    The father says he attempted to reconcile with the mother, guided by his
    Coptic Orthodox faith, which he says forbids divorce absent adultery. Father
    Youstos Ghaly, a Coptic priest, played a major role in this attempted reconciliation
    according to the father, reaching out to the father and the mother, who was
    of the same faith, to try to bring the two together. The father’s hope was
    that his wife would eventually agree to return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida with Andrew. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother says that the father made few attempts at reconciliation. She says
    she was firm beginning in late September that neither she nor Andrew would
    be returning to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida. Although she concedes that she had contact with Father Ghaly – indeed
    she says she was the one who initiated it – she denies he played the conciliatory
    role her husband claims he did. She says she tried to persuade the father
    to relocate to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , whose social services she felt made it a better place for them to live.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the mother did not use her return ticket, she did make one attempt to cross
    the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    border. On September 24, 2006, she and Andrew tried to cross the Fort Erie/Buffalo
    Peace Bridge on foot. Border officials turned her away. The mother explained
    this attempt by saying that an immigration lawyer had told her that crossing
    on foot would increase her chances of getting in. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 25, 2007, the mother began custody proceedings in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. She served the father with notice of her motion for custody on February
    7, 2007. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six
    weeks later, on March 20, 2007, the father began custody proceedings in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida. This motion was his first resort to the legal system to secure Andrew’s
    return. The father served the mother with notice of his motion for custody
    on April 5, 2007. He also began divorce proceedings at that time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the two parallel proceedings, on April 26, 2007, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario judge, Justice Hatton, and the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida judge, Judge Santurri, held a conference call with the parties’ counsel
    to determine the proper venue for hearing a motion on custody jurisdiction.
    They concurred, and the parties agreed, that the Ontario Superior Court would
    hear the jurisdictional motion. During the conference call, no one made any
    mention of an application for Andrew’s summary return under the Hague Convention
    on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“Hague Convention” or
    “Convention”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 23, 2007, the day before the jurisdictional motion was set to be heard,
    the father served the mother with notice that he would be commencing an application
    under the Hague Convention for Andrew’s summary return to Florida. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hague Convention motion was heard on June 7, 2007 before Ferguson J. of the
    Superior Court. The motion judge declined to order Andrew’s return. Invoking
    Article 13(a) of the Hague Convention, she concluded that the father had
    acquiesced in Andrew’s retention in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. Her conclusion was based largely on the father’s delay in initiating
    his Hague Convention application. Based on this acquiescence, she used the
    discretion granted to her under Article 13 of the Convention not to apply
    the summary return mechanism in Article 12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Andrew,
    now two and a half years old, continues to reside in

    Ontario with his mother. He has not seen his father in 19 months. </p>
  <h3>C. <u>ISSUE</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue on appeal is whether the motion judge erred in concluding that
    the father acquiesced in his son’s retention and declining on that basis
    to order Andrew’s return to Florida under the Hague Convention. </p>
  <h3>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    analysis of the Hague Convention requires bearing in mind that instrument’s
    core objective: securing the prompt return of abducted children to their
    country of habitual residence. In <i>Thomson v. Thomson</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R.
    551, the Supreme Court of Canada’s leading case on the Hague Convention,
    La Forest J. stated at p. 559: “The underlying purpose of the Convention,
    as set forth in its preamble, is to protect children from the harmful effects
    of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure
    their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence.” The Convention
    thus establishes a presumption in favour of ordering the child’s summary
    return under Article 12. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Convention creates certain exceptions to the mandatory return procedure for
    children wrongfully removed or retained. Those exceptions, contained in Articles
    12, 13 and 20, were intended to be of limited scope. The Convention’s drafters
    envisaged a “restrictive” interpretation of these exceptions: see Elisa Pérez-Vera, “Explanatory
    Report” in Hague Conference on Private International Law, <i>Acts and Documents
    of the Fourteenth Session</i>, vol. 3 (The Hague: 1980) at para. 34. Similarly,
    Chamberland J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>M.G. v. R.F.</i>, [2002]
    J.Q. No. 3568 at para. 30, said: </p>
  <p>The Hague Convention is a very efficient tool conceived by the international
    community to dissuade parents from illegally removing their children from
    one country to another.  However it is also, in my view, a fragile tool and
    any interpretation short of a rigorous one of the few exceptions inserted
    in the Convention would rapidly compromise its efficacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exception at issue in the case at bar is contained in Article 13(a), which
    reads: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><i>Article 13</i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Notwithstanding
      the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative
      authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>a)</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'> the
      person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the
      child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal

    make two observations about this provision. First, it places the burden for
    establishing acquiescence on the person who opposes the child’s return – in
    this case, the mother. Second, <span style='color:black'>whereas return of
    the child under Article 12 is mandatory where the court finds wrongful removal
    or retention, a court’s decision not to return a child because of the aggrieved
    parent’s acquiescence is a discretionary decision: where Article 13(a) applies,
    the requested state “is not bound to order the return of the child”.        </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Katsigiannis
      v. Kottick-Katsigiannis</i> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 456 (C.A.), this court
      performed an in-depth analysis of Article 13(a) and decided to adopt the
      analysis of acquiescence set out in a House of Lords judgment by Lord Browne-Wilkinson:
      see <i>In re H and others (Minors) (Abduction: Acquiescence)</i> [1998]
      A.C. 72 (H.L.). This court’s conclusion was that acquiescence is a question
      of the aggrieved parent’s subjective intention, not one of the outside
      world’s perceptions of that intention (para. 48). Subjective intention
      can be demonstrated through conduct, but such a demonstration requires
      the abducting parent to show “clear and cogent evidence”
    of “conduct . . . which is inconsistent with the summary return of the children
    to their habitual residence” (para. 49). Moreover, to override the mandatory
    return mechanism, the acquiescence must be “unequivocal” (para. 49).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge referred to <i>Katsigiannis</i> and correctly
    summarized its holding. However, the motion judge went on to refer to the
    concept of
    “passive acquiescence,” which she said “occurs when the aggrieved parent
    allows enough time to pass without insisting on summary return.” She went
    on to conclude that “[w]aiting and permitting Andrew to become settled in
    Ontario and to establish roots with his mother and her extended family <i>can
    only be the result</i> of acquiescence on the part of the father.”
    [Emphasis added.] The four factual findings at the end of her endorsement
    follow a similar path of reasoning: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>(i) there is clear and cogent
    evidence of unequivocal acquiescence; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>(ii) the father’s conduct
    is inconsistent with the summary return of Andrew to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida. He did not take immediate or even relatively immediate steps. He
    only brought the Hague motion in May of 2007; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>(iii) there has been passive
    acquiescence on the part of the father i.e. enough time has passed without
    insisting on summary return; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>(iv) acquiescence, in this
    case, can be inferred from the father’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, in my view the motion judge misapplied the concept of acquiescence
    set out in Article 13(a) and explained in <i>Katsigiannis</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    eight-month delay between the mother’s failure to return Andrew on the September
    29 return flight and the father’s commencement of Hague Convention proceedings
    cannot, without more, constitute acquiescence. The Hague Convention, under
    Article 12, allows aggrieved parents one year following the date of the wrongful
    removal or retention to apply for their child’s summary return, and to have
    the Convention’s summary return mechanism apply with its full force. Even
    after a year has passed, an aggrieved parent’s summary-return rights are
    not extinguished; the return mechanism is merely softened, with the abducting
    parent given the chance to override mandatory return upon proof that the
    child has “become settled in its new environment”: see Article 12. To infer
    acquiescence solely on the basis of delay where the application was filed
    within eight months is inconsistent with Article 12. Given Article 12’s one-year
    window, which is not even a strict limitation period, such delay cannot by
    itself constitute “clear and cogent evidence” of
    “conduct . . . which is inconsistent with the summary return of the children
    to their habitual residence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are good reasons not to deny the aggrieved parent the one-year window provided
    by Article 12. The parent may initially be unaware of the Hague Convention
    and of the rights and remedies flowing from it. The parent may, as the father
    claims here, attempt reconciliation, or to otherwise settle the dispute outside
    the courtroom. Most importantly, such a broad interpretation of acquiescence
    is inconsistent with the purpose of the Convention, which is to secure the
    prompt return of abducted children, and with the correspondingly limited
    scope of the Convention’s exceptions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge committed a similar error in principle by referring to the fact
    that “Andrew [had] become settled in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and . . . establish[ed] roots with his mother and her extended family”.
    Pursuant to Article 12, the degree to which the child has become settled
    has no bearing on a Hague Convention application filed within one year. The
    familial bonds Andrew has forged in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario may well influence the issue of where and with whom this toddler
    should reside, but such custodial matters are not before us: see Hague Convention,
    Articles 16, 19; <i>Thomson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 578. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge noted that the father did not commence his Hague Convention
    application until after the jurisdiction motion was set to be argued in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. Indeed, no mention of the Hague Convention was made during the conference
    call during which the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida judges set
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario as the venue for the jurisdictional hearing. Further, the father
    filed notice of his application the day before the date for which the jurisdictional
    hearing was scheduled, and the day after he had filed his factum for that
    hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father’s procedural conduct is not inconsistent with summary return. Consenting
    to and preparing for a jurisdictional hearing in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario did not show a weakened will on the father’s part to seek his son’s
    return. Indeed, had the jurisdictional motion taken place, the father would
    almost certainly have argued something very similar to what he argued before
    Ferguson J. and before this court: that Andrew should be returned to Florida
    for a custody hearing in that state. The fact that that argument would have
    been based on <i>forum non conveniens</i> rather than Article 12 of the Hague
    Convention says nothing about the father’s desire for the swift return of
    his son. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the trial judge erred in interpreting Article 13(a) and in
    finding that the father had acquiesced in Andrew’s wrongful retention. In
    my view, the mother did not show conduct by the father inconsistent with
    summary return or in any other way establish unequivocal acquiescence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the exception contained in Article 13(a) does not apply, I would order that
    Andrew be returned forthwith to

    Florida. Given Andrew’s young age and attachment to his mother, it is appropriate
    that she travel with him. The father has agreed to make accommodations for
    the return of mother and child, and should do so by covering their airfare
    expenses, providing financial support for their basic needs (including food,
    clothing and medical treatment), arranging separate accommodation for the
    mother in
