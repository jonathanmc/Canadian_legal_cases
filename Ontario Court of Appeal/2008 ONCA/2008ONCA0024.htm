  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=FR-CA>The

      devez faire rapport de <i>toutes relations que vous entamez</i> avec les
      femmes à votre superviseur.&nbsp;» </span>[Emphasis added].  The parole
      board provided an English translation of the conditions, translating this
      condition as follows:
    “You must report <i>any relationships entered into</i> with females to your
    supervisor.” [Emphasis added].  The information charging the appellant with
    breaching s. 753.3 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> defined the condition as being: “You
    must report to your supervisor <i>all relationships that you initiate</i> with
    women.” [Emphasis added]. </p>

  <p><b>Facts</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant encountered a young woman at a laundromat who was having difficulty
    with one of the machines.  After providing her with some help, the appellant
    engaged her in conversation that included details about where they both had
    lived and about their work and family situations.  She testified that he
    appeared to be stressed.
     When he told her he had traveled to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Rwanda</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region>
    , and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>
    , she became suspicious but continued to converse with him.  The appellant
    told her about his daughter and also that he had recently been in prison
    after beating up a man he found with his wife.  He also told her that he
    was now on conditional release, that he was being followed and that he had
    both a parole officer and a psychologist.  The appellant further related
    that he had difficulty controlling himself and that he was the man who had
    sought an injunction in 1989 to restrain his then girlfriend from having
    an abortion in the case that had gone to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The
    woman indicated her disagreement with him having dragged his girlfriend through
    the courts.  At some point in the conversation the appellant asked her if
    she had a boyfriend to which she responded “no”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    woman testified that she realized that he was a potentially dangerous person,
    that he had “a hard time controlling himself” and that he was someone who
    is “convinced of his rights.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the conversation, which lasted between 90 minutes and two hours,
    the appellant asked her if she had a good memory and gave her his telephone
    number in “case that one day I might want to go out with him for a coffee”.  She
    testified that she told him he could give her his number and that she would
    call him but that but she had no intention of doing so.  The two left the
    laundromat together and then parted after three or four minutes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police were monitoring the entire encounter and interviewed the woman almost
    immediately.  When the appellant met with his parole officer a few days later
    he failed to report the laundromat encounter and this charge followed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that by giving the woman his phone number the appellant
    was, in the language of the information, “initiating a relationship” with
    her and that, under the terms of his release, he was required to report that
    to his parole officer.  The trial judge convicted the appellant and sentenced
    him to 15 months imprisonment.</p>
  <p> <b>Issue</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by finding that his encounter
    with the woman in the laundromat was caught by the language of the special
    condition and was therefore something the appellant had to report to his
    supervisor. </p>
  <p><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has a disturbing record of abusing women with whom he forms relationships,
    a record that led to him being declared a long term offender.  The condition
    at issue on this appeal serves to protect vulnerable women who might enter
    a relationship with the appellant by requiring him to notify his supervisor
    so that appropriate steps can be taken to warn and protect the woman involved.  Clearly,
    we must interpret the condition in the light of its protective purpose and
    avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation that would impede the authorities
    in supervising the appellant to ensure that he does not reoffend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, we must also be mindful that failure to comply with the condition constitutes
    a serious criminal offence carrying a period of up to ten years imprisonment
    and that it must be interpreted according to applicable legal principles.  In
    particular, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the principle explained
    by Dickson J. in <i>Marcotte v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Deputy A.G.), </i>[1976] 1 S.C.R. 108 at 115:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No authority is needed for the proposition that
    if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise, in the construction
    and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a subject, then that
    statute should be applied in such a manner as to favour the person against
    whom it is sought to be enforced. If one is to be incarcerated, one should
    at least know that some Act of Parliament requires it in express terms, and
    not, at most, by implication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    turn first to the wording of the condition.  As I have already noted, we
    have before us three different versions of the terms of the special condition.  <span lang=FR-CA>The
    condition was drafted in French. I therefore will focus on that version: “Vous
    devez faire rapport de <i>toutes relations que vous entamez</i> avec les
    femmes à votre superviseur.”  </span>[Emphasis added].  “Entamer” is translated
    as “to cut into”, “to broach”, “to penetrate” and while it means “to initiate” in
    certain contexts (for example, “entamer des poursuites” means “to intitiate
    proceedings”), the phrase “entamer des relations avec quelqu’un” is translated
    as “to enter into relations with someone”:<i> Harraps New Standard French
    and English Dictionary,</i> (London: George G. Harrap &amp; Co., 1972).  This
    dictionary meaning corresponds with the Parole Board’s translation of the
    condition as
    “You must report <i>any relationships entered into</i> with females to your
    supervisor.” [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can see no reason why we should not interpret the word “entamer” in the same
    manner as did the Parole Board itself as meaning, as the dictionary states, “to
    enter into”. In my view, the trial judge, no doubt misled by the erroneous
    language of the information, erred by overlooking the language of the condition
    as it was drafted and translated by the Parole Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    condition must be interpreted in its proper context.  The Parole Board provided
    the following reasons for the condition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The third condition would be to report any relationships
    that you enter into with females. <i>You have a history of psychologically
    and physically abusing women you lived with. </i>In addition, you have previously
    shown great difficulty controlling your anger. Your victims indicated that
    you often become aggressive without provocation. The Board notes that you
    have a number of convictions for uttering threats and seem incapable of empathy. <i>Your
    pattern is to become violent and controlling once you start living with a
    woman.</i> [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Parole Board’s reasons for the condition certainly suggest that the Board’s
    concern is with the formation of any relationship with a woman that might
    lead to a recurrence of his past abusive behaviour.  Those relationships
    are described as being of a “live-in” nature.  While I certainly do not say
    that the appellant would only be required to report live-in relationships,
    the Board’s reasons do suggest that more than a casual or chance encounter
    with a woman is required to trigger the duty to report. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    condition at issue should also be interpreted in the light of other conditions
    that require the appellant to follow psychological counselling, to reside
    in a community correctional centre for ninety days after his release and
    to avoid any contact with victims and their families.  He is not prohibited
    from having any casual contact with women nor is he required to report such
    contact –  he is only required to report relationships he enters into.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proper
    consideration must also be given to the word
    “relationship”. We were referred to the reasons of Karakatsanis J. rendered
    in <i>R. v. Tremblay</i>, (19 October 2007),
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto (Ont. Sup.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ct.), a similar prosecution against the appellant for breach of the same
    condition arising out of a similar incident that occurred after his conviction
    in the case at bar. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karakatsanis
    J. cited the <i>Concise Oxford English Dictionary</i> meaning of “relationship”: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) the way in which two or more people or things
    are connected, of the state of being connected, the way in which two or more
    people or groups regard and behave towards each other, and (2) as an emotional
    and sexual association between two people.</p>
  <p>She ruled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here needs to be some mutual level of involvement,
    or connectedness, between two people for them to have a ‘relationship.’
    In essence, it takes at least two of them to make a relationship. It seems
    to me that in applying this definition to the phrase ‘any relationship entered
    into with females’ in the context of the condition of this long-term supervision
    order, the second more restricted definition in the dictionary is most appropriate.
    The Parole Board fashioned the condition to ensure notice where there was
    a relationship that could develop into cohabitation with a woman. The word ‘relationship’ in
    this context refers to any mutual connection with a woman that engages on
    an emotional or sexual level. While the relationship need not necessarily
    be romantic and could be, for example, one of friendship, it does not in
    my view include an unsuccessful attempt to enter into a relationship with
    another person or an interest by one person to enter into a relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I would not foreclose the possibility that repeated, casual encounters could
    trigger an obligation to report even if such encounters lacked mutuality,
    I agree with Karakakatsanis J that the condition does not require the appellant
    to report every isolated  unsuccessful attempt to enter a relationship.
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have already indicated, the condition at issue must be interpreted in the
    light of its purpose of protecting women who might enter a relationship with
    the appellant that would expose them to the risk posed by his pattern of
    abusive behaviour.  In my view, excluding casual encounters and unsuccessful
    attempts to engage women of the kind at issue here does not undermine that
    important purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the parole authorities have other means available, short of charging the
    appellant with this serious criminal offence, should they perceive a genuine
    risk to the public: see <a name=anchorBill></a><a
name=P1></a><i>Corrections and Conditional Release Act 1992</i>, c. 20, s. 135.1(1)
    conferring the power to suspend the long-term supervision not only when an
    offender breaches a condition, but also</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…when the member [of the Board] or person [designated,
    by name or by position] is satisfied that it is necessary and reasonable
    to suspend the long-term supervision in order to prevent a breach of any
    condition of it or to protect society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    need not decide whether that power could properly be invoked on the facts
    of the present case. Suffice it to say that when the parole authorities are
    satisfied that suspension of the long-term supervision order and the arrest
    of the appellant are required to protect the public, they have the power
    to act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the evidence of how the appellant’s supervisor explained
    this condition to the appellant supports the conclusion that the condition
    required the appellant to report his encounter at the laundromat. In my view,
    the evidence relied upon is not relevant to the legal issue to be decided,
    and even if it were relevant, the evidence fails to support the Crown’s contention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence is not relevant because the issue here is not whether the appellant
    had the necessary <i>mens rea,</i> but rather whether the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> has been made out.  The definition of the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> relates to the proper legal interpretation of the ingredients of
    the offence and I fail to see how what the supervisor told the appellant
    can have any bearing on that issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, as I read the evidence, it falls short of supporting the proposition
    advanced by the Crown.  The appellant’s supervisor testified that, prior
    to the date on which the appellant failed to report the laundromat encounter,
    he had explained to the appellant several times that “all female relationships
    include casual, platonic, romantic, and intimate relationships”
    and that “a relationship also meant that if he was going for a coffee with
    a lady, I would expect him to report it to me immediately or the next day,
    or whenever the opportunity would arise.”  He admitted on cross-examination,
    however, that he did not tell the appellant that he would have to report
    if he had asked a woman to go for a coffee even if she did not agree to the
