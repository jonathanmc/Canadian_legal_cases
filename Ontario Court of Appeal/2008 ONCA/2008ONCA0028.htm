  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals three aspects of the trial judgment.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         Did
      the Plaintiff Prove Gross Negligence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the City did not adhere
    to its own policy respecting treatment of the sidewalks on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Preston St.  While there was evidence of spot sanding over a forty-two kilometre
    area, there was no evidence that any sanding was done on Preston St., not
    just on the spot where the accident occurred, but in the entire area.  On
    the other hand, the plaintiff adduced evidence in her own testimony and from
    another eye-witness of untreated icy conditions on both sidewalks on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Preston&nbsp;St.   Moreover, the zone supervisor did not even appreciate
    that the street fell within the business district and thus was required to
    be free of ice and snow and to be sanded in accordance with the City’s own
    policy.  This might well explain the failure to sand the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Preston St. sidewalks at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    while the policy itself was reasonable, the City did not implement that policy
    in circumstances where it knew that icy conditions were likely to occur because
    of the freezing and thawing conditions that had occurred over the previous
    days.  We have not been persuaded that the trial judge committed any palpable
    and overriding error in concluding that in the circumstances this deviation
    from the City’s policy amounted to gross negligence.  As this court said
    in <i>Huycke v. The Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cobourg</i>, [1937] O.R. 682 at 690:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The law is well-settled
    that if a municipality permits a slippery, icy sidewalk in a thickly peopled
    part of the municipality to remain unprotected or ignores it altogether,
    and some one is injured, that would constitute gross negligence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         The
      Admissibility of Dr. Wellar’s Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that Dr. Wellar’s expertise lay solely in urban design
    not maintenance and thus he did not have the requisite expertise.  Further,
    the appellant submits that expert evidence was not necessary about the appropriate
    standard of care.  Finally, it is submitted that the trial judge gave undue
    weight to the expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  There was little real dispute
    that the City’s policy established the proper standard of care.  The real
    issues were whether the appellant adhered to that policy and, if not, whether
    the failure to do so amounted to gross negligence.  These were essentially
    factual questions that did not depend on the expert evidence.  Whether or
    not the expert evidence should have been admitted, its admission had no impact
    on the trial judge’s conclusions on the real issues in the case.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         Pre-judgment
      Interest on the Award for Loss of Competitive Advantage</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that in this case, the award for loss of competitive
    advantage falls within s. 128(4)(a) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> representing
    pecuniary loss arising after the date of the order.  The trial judge made
    an award for past loss of income.  The award for loss of competitive advantage
    looked entirely to the future.  Accordingly, we allow the appeal in part
    and set aside the award of prejudgment interest of $19,500.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         Loss
      of Earning Capacity</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time of the trial, the plaintiff was earning more from her job as a teller
    than she did pre-accident as a hairdresser.  The trial judge made no award
    for future loss of income but, as we have said, made an award for loss of
    competitive advantage.  The plaintiff submits that the loss of her profession
    as a hairdresser should be viewed as loss of a capital asset.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the trial judge to find that the plaintiff’s approach to her
    profession would not materially change during the rest of working life with
    the result that she was not deprived of a capital asset that would exceed
    her present earning capacity.  The contrary position taken by the plaintiff’s
    expert was based on assumptions that the trial judge rejected.  The trial
    judge gave cogent reasons for rejecting those assumptions and hence the expert
    opinion.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Future
      Care Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the plaintiff was overreaching in respect of future
    care costs.  The trial judge noted in particular that in the almost five
    years between the date of the accident and the trial the plaintiff had not
    availed herself of most of the elements of the recommended care.  The trial
    judge was not bound to accept the expert opinion but was entitled to reach
    his own conclusion as to the elements of future care costs, even in the absence
    of contrary expert evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sought approximately $140,000 for costs including disbursements.  The
    trial judge awarded $100,000 in costs as being fair and reasonable notwithstanding
    the plaintiff obtained an award in excess of the offers to settle.  We have
    not been persuaded that the trial judge’s approach represented an error in
    principle given the circumstances including his rejection of much of the
    plaintiff’s expert evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4.         Interest
      on Out-of-Pocket Expenses</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agree that there should be pre-judgment interest on the out-of-pocket
    expenses including the OHIP subrogated claim.  Accordingly, we allow the
    cross-appeal to this extent.  In all other respects, the cross-appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
