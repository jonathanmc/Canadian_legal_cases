  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant, Leslie Baker, seeks leave to appeal two convictions under the <i>Public</i> <i>Lands</i> <i>Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.43.  Mr. Baker is a status Indian and a member of Couchiching
    First Nation, a signatory to Treaty Three.  In the spring of 2001, Mr. Baker
    built a cabin on
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trout
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake, not far from his home in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Fort
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Frances.  He was charged with doing so without a work permit under the <i>Public</i> <i>Lands</i> <i>Act</i> and
    contrary to a stop work order issued under the act.  At his trial before
    Clysdale-Cornell J.P., Mr. Baker contended that he did not need a permit
    because his cabin was a communal <i>Sundown</i> cabin built in furtherance
    of his treaty right to hunt and fish.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace held that Mr. Baker’s building of a cabin was reasonably
    incidental to his treaty rights.  Nonetheless, she still convicted him of
    the two charges because she found that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trout
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake was outside Couchiching First Nation’s traditional territory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal McKay J. upheld both convictions.  But in doing so he reversed two
    key findings of the justice of the peace.  First, the appeal court judge
    found that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trout
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake was within Couchiching First Nation’s traditional territory and that
    the justice of the peace’s contrary finding was not supported by the evidence.  Both
    parties had agreed that the justice of the peace had made a factual error.  Second,
    the appeal court judge held that Mr. Baker did not build his cabin in furtherance
    of any treaty right. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker now seeks leave to appeal to this court under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial</i> <i>Offences</i> <i>Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.  The statute prescribes a high threshold for obtaining
    leave: to succeed Mr. Baker must show that it is essential in the public
    interest or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted.  Mr.
    Baker endeavours to meet this test by raising three grounds of appeal: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appeal court judge erred by improperly overturning the justice of the peace’s
    finding that Mr. Baker was exercising a treaty right when he built his cabin;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appeal court judge erred by failing to permit Mr. Baker  to challenge the
    constitutionality of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>, regardless of whether he
    was exercising a treaty right; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appeal court judge erred by failing to set aside the convictions because
    of the reasonable apprehension of bias arising from the justice of the peace’s
    relationship with the district manager of the Ministry of Natural Resources,
    the ministry responsible for enforcing the <i>Public</i> <i>Lands</i> <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the brief reasons that follow, I do not consider it essential in the public
    interest or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted on
    any of the three grounds of appeal.  Thus, I dismiss the motion.</p>
  <h3>1)        Whether Mr. Baker was exercising a treaty right when he built
    his cabin</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker argues that the appeal court judge improperly overturned a finding
    of fact made by the justice of the peace.  He contends that the question
    whether a person has an Aboriginal or treaty right is a question of fact,
    not a question of law.  He argues that under s. 120 of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, an appeal court judge is entitled to review a factual finding
    only if it is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, which is not the
    case here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this argument.  The question whether a person possesses an
    Aboriginal or treaty right is a question of law, not a question of fact:
    see <i>R. v. Van der Peet</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 at para. 82.  As the determination
    of Mr. Baker’s treaty rights is a question of law, under s. 120(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> the appeal court judge was entitled
    to review that determination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    it seems to me that the appeal court judge was correct in holding that Mr.
    Baker had not put forward an adequate evidentiary record to establish that
    he built his cabin in furtherance of a treaty right.  Mr. Baker bore the
    burden to establish that the construction of his cabin was reasonably incidental
    to his treaty right to hunt and fish: see <i>R. v. Sundown</i>, [1999] 1
    S.C.R. 393.  In <i>Sundown</i> at para. 30, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    elaborated on this burden: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In order to determine what is reasonably incidental
    to the treaty right to hunt, the reasonable person must examine the historical
    and contemporary practice of that specific treaty right by the aboriginal
    group in question to see how the treaty right has been and continues to be
    exercised.…
    The question is whether the activity asserted as being reasonably incidental
    is in fact incidental to an actually practiced right to hunt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record in this case contains little evidence to connect Mr. Baker’s construction
    of his cabin either to the historical or contemporary practice of the Couchiching
    First Nation.  In short, he did not show that he built a communal <i>Sundown</i> cabin.  Instead,
    as the appeal court judge held, he seems to have built a summer cottage for
    personal use.  Further, as the cabin is less than an hour from his home,
    he could exercise his treaty right to hunt and fish without the cabin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal does not warrant granting leave.</p>
  <h3>2)        Whether Mr. Baker can challenge the constitutionality of the <i>Public
      Lands Act</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker also argues that he should have been acquitted because the <i>Public
    Lands Act</i> is constitutionally invalid and that he should be permitted
    to mount this constitutional challenge even if he has not established an
    Aboriginal or treaty right.  This court’s recent judgment in <i>R. v. Shipman</i> (2007),
    85 O.R. (3d) 585 answers Mr. Baker’s argument.  There, at para. 21, LaForme
    J.A. held that a person who has not established an Aboriginal or treaty right
    cannot attack the underlying regulatory regime.  Alternatively, even if the
    court has discretion to allow Mr. Baker to challenge the constitutionality
    of the statute, in the absence of an adequate evidentiary record, this is
    not an appropriate case to assess the validity of the regulatory regime.  Thus,
    this ground of appeal also does not warrant granting leave.</p>
  <h3>3)        Whether a reasonable apprehension of bias exists</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker contends that the relationship between the justice of the peace and
    the district manager of the Ministry of Natural Resources gives rise to a
    reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the justice of the peace that
    warrants setting aside his convictions.  The justice of the peace and the
    district manager are sister-in-law and brother-in-law; the district manager’s
    elk are transported to market by the farm operated by the justice of the
    peace; the two live across the road from each other in a small rural area
    and apparently their children play together.  The appeal court judge rejected
    Mr. Baker’s contention that this relationship gave rise to a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.  Mr. Baker submits this issue alone is sufficiently important that
    leave ought to be granted.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    as the Crown acknowledges, it is essential in the public interest and for
    the due administration of justice that our judicial system be free of any
    taint of bias.  The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is set out by
    de Grandpré J. in <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy
    Board</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394.  That test, which has been endorsed
    consistently by the Supreme Court, is whether an informed person, viewing
    the matter realistically and practically would think it more likely than
    not that the decision-maker, whether consciously or unconsciously, would
    not decide fairly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the facts of this case do raise a legitimate concern, the threshold for establishing
    disqualifying bias is high and I do not think it has been met in this case:
    see <i>R. v. R.D.S.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para. 113.  Moreover, in
    deciding whether to grant leave, I must look at “the particular circumstances
    of the case”: see s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>.<i>  </i>And
    here, in my view, the particular circumstances of this case do not justify
    granting leave.  Indeed, several considerations weigh against granting leave.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Often
    in small rural communities in this province, the resident judge or justice
    of the peace will previously have had contact with or knowledge of one or
    more of the parties or witnesses before the court.  By itself, that should
    not cause a reasonably informed person to have an apprehension of bias.  Admittedly,
    here, the relations between the district manager and the justice of the peace
    go beyond mere previous contact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in this case, I see no other facts that might lend support to the bias allegation.  For
    example, the record does not show that the district manager played any role
    in the investigation or the laying of charges against Mr. Baker.  The district
    manager did not appear as a witness at the trial.  And there is no hint of
    bias in the trial record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    Mr. Baker does not dispute that he built his cabin in breach of a stop work
    order and without obtaining a permit under the statute.  His argument was
    purely a question of law that did not turn on any serious factual dispute
    or on the credibility of any witnesses.  These considerations do not make
    this a desirable case in which to deal with the question of bias Mr. Baker
    raises.  Thus, I deny leave on this last ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.  </p>
