  <h2>I.          Introduction </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal arises from a Crown wardship proceeding involving infant twin boys,
    R.S. and D.S., born in September 2004.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    background facts are horrific.  While in the exclusive care of their young
    parents in the weeks immediately following their births, both children were
    subjected to extreme physical abuse by their father, J.S.  Each child sustained
    life-threatening injuries, including skull fractures, brain injuries, retinal
    haemorrhages and fractures to their arms, legs and ribs.  The injuries were
    consistent with ‘Shaken Baby Syndrome’, involving a high degree of force.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    discovery of the abuse in early November 2004, when the boys were six weeks
    old, the twins were apprehended by the respondent Children’s Aid Society
    of the Districts of Nipissing and Parry Sound (the CAS).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.
    and the appellant S.S. – the children’s mother – were both charged criminally
    with aggravated assault and failing to provide the necessities of life to
    the children.  After a preliminary inquiry, the appellant was discharged
    on all criminal charges and J.S. was committed for trial without opposition.  A
    subsequent application by the Crown for <i>certiorari</i> regarding the charges
    against the appellant was dismissed, as was the Crown’s appeal against that
    dismissal.  J.S.’s criminal trial is pending.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 9, 2004, with the support of the Office of the Children’s Lawyer,
    the CAS applied for an order for permanent Crown wardship of the boys, without
    access by their parents, under the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 15, 2004, on consent, the children were found to be in need of protection
    within the meaning of the Act and placed in the care of the CAS.  They have
    remained in CAS care ever since, without access by their father or, until
    recently, by their mother.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    placement hearing commenced on August 11, 2005 before Rodgers J. of the Ontario
    Court of Justice (the placement judge).  At the hearing, the appellant sought
    the return of her sons to her care, under terms of supervision.  J.S. did
    not participate in the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a seven-day hearing, the placement judge found that J.S. had abused the children,
    that the appellant was “oblivious” to the abuse, and that the appellant delayed
    in seeking medical treatment for D.S. when his injuries became apparent because
    she was emotionally dominated by J.S.  He further concluded that the appellant,
    with assistance, was capable of caring for and meeting the needs of the children.  In
    his view, it was in the children’s best interests that they be returned to
    the care of their mother, on a graduated basis and subject to terms of supervision.  Accordingly,
    on February 6, 2006, he ordered the return of R.S. and D.S. to their mother
    following a three-month period of CAS wardship and subject to a nine-month
    supervision order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CAS, again supported by the Office of the Children’s Lawyer, appealed this
    placement decision.  By orders dated May 8, 2007, Boissonneault J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the
    placement judge, and directed that both boys be made wards of the Crown without
    access and committed to the care and custody of the CAS.  The appellant now
    appeals to this court against the appeal judge’s orders.</p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant advances two main arguments in support of her appeal.  She submits
    that the appeal judge erred: (i) by essentially retrying the case, thereby
    exceeding the scope of permissible appellate review; and (ii) by misapprehending
    the evidence before the placement judge concerning her past conduct in relation
    to the children and her present parenting ability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.  However, because I am
    also of the view that the placement judge’s decision cannot stand, a new
    placement hearing is required.</p>
  <h2>III.       Discussion</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Appeal Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    placement judge’s finding that J.S. was the perpetrator of the abuse inflicted
    on the children was not appealed by the CAS.  The appeal judge accepted this
    finding.  However, unlike the placement judge, the appeal judge also held
    that the appellant had failed to care or provide for, supervise or protect
    the children and that her failure to do so was the result of her drug use.  He
    also disagreed with the placement judge’s findings that, with assistance,
    S.S. could now properly care for her sons, that she did not know of the abuse
    being inflicted by J.S., and that her failure to seek prompt medical assistance
    for D.S. was influenced by her domineering and emotionally abusive spouse.  In
    the appeal judge’s view, the evidence at the placement hearing did not support
    these key findings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, it is my opinion that the appeal judge erred by substituting his
    own factual findings for those of the placement judge.  Absent palpable and
    overriding error by the placement judge, his factual findings were entitled
    to deference by the appeal judge: see <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002]
    2 S.C.R. 235; and <i>H.L. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.  This was especially true in
    this case because many of the placement judge’s critical findings with which
    the appeal judge disagreed were grounded in the placement judge’s observations
    and his appreciation of the credibility of the witnesses at the placement
    hearing, including the appellant: see <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i> (2004), 186
    O.A.C. 201 at paras. 359-60, leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, [2004]
    S.C.C.A. No. 291.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
    the appeal judge’s reasons contain no reference to this principle of deference.  Nor
    do they reflect an appreciation of the limited scope of permissible appellate
    review of the placement judge’s decision.  Instead, the appeal judge’s reasons
    indicate that he undertook an independent <i>de novo</i> assessment of the
    evidence at the placement hearing.  This was an error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    defect in the appeal judge’s analysis was compounded by the fact that many
    of his own findings, which stood in stark contrast to those of the placement
    judge, themselves rested on an assessment of credibility.  For example, contrary
    to the placement judge’s finding that the appellant failed to seek timely
    medical assistance for D.S. because of her vulnerability to the boys’ abusive
    and domineering father, the appeal judge held that the appellant’s explanation
    for her conduct was “incredible”, “feeble” and “unreasonable”.  But, unlike
    the placement judge, the appeal judge did not have the advantage of hearing
    the appellant’s evidence first hand
    – or, indeed, the evidence of any of the witnesses, including that of the
    expert witnesses – nor the opportunity to observe the witnesses when they
    testified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and perhaps more importantly, the reasons of the appeal judge indicate that
    he misapprehended critical evidence bearing on the appellant’s past and current
    ability to care for her children.  The appeal judge found that the appellant
    continued to use illegal drugs after the birth of her children, that her
    failure to obtain assistance for the boys was “probably due to the lifestyle
    and drug environment” adopted by her and her husband, and that there was
    no evidence of either the appellant’s “present” drug use or regarding whether
    she had “addressed the ‘core’ problem of drugs”.  He also viewed the appellant’s
    evidence as establishing that she observed J.S. “shaking the children” and
    dropping R.S. into his crib from a height of “one and one half feet”.  These
    important findings were central to the appeal judge’s conclusion that the
    placement judge had erred by holding that the appellant was unaware of her
    husband’s abuse of the children, that she was capable of now caring for the
    children – with assistance, and that her past failure to obtain timely medical
    assistance for D.S. was explicable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    it was conceded before this court that there was no evidence before the placement
    judge that the appellant had a continuing drug problem after the birth of
    her sons or that the consumption by her of drugs – in contrast to J.S.’s
    use of drugs – played any part in what befell the boys.  Nor was there evidence
    that the appellant actually saw J.S. shaking the babies or that she saw J.S.
    drop R.S. into his crib from the distance described by the appeal judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the appeal judge framed the critical question before him in these terms: “The
    question on this appeal is whether [S.S.] protected the children as provided
    for in the Act.”  This was not the issue for determination by the appeal
    judge.  Where, as here, a placement decision was made following a full hearing,
    the requisite inquiry was whether the placement judge’s decision concerning
    the best interests of the children was tainted by legal error and whether
    it could be sustained on the evidence adduced at the placement hearing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the combined effect of these errors requires that the appeal
    judge’s decision be set aside.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Placement Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    I agree with the appeal judge, although for different reasons, that the placement
    judge’s decision cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have indicated, the placement judge found that the appellant was “oblivious
    to the harm being done” to her children and that her failure to obtain prompt
    medical help for D.S. was the product of her domination by, and vulnerability
    to, the boys’ abusive father.  He also held that the appellant was capable
    of caring for and meeting the needs of the children, with assistance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
    on the appellant’s own testimony, she observed unexplained bruises and scratches
    on the children’s bodies.  She also heard them engage, on several occasions,
    in unusual and abnormal crying.  She also admitted that she was aware of
    J.S.’s frustration with the care of the children, his history of drug use
    and his predilection for violence when angry.  She testified that she believed
    J.S. was using drugs while the boys were in his care and, importantly, that
    she saw J.S. angrily drop one of the children into his crib about one week
    before they were apprehended by the CAS.  A review of the transcript of the
    appellant’s evidence at the placement hearing also indicates that, by her
    own admission, she was suspicious that the appellant might be harming the
    children and took steps to “catch him in the act”.  When asked if she had
    any fear that J.S. was abusing the children, the appellant replied, “I think
    maybe a bit.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence bore directly on the key questions of the appellant’s past and future
    ability to care for the children and her contemporaneous knowledge of the
    abuse.  However, based on his reasons, I am unable to conclude that the placement
    judge took this evidence into account when holding that the appellant was “oblivious” to
    the abuse inflicted by J.S. and that she is now able to care for her sons,
    with assistance.  If the placement judge was alert to this important evidence,
    his reasons provide no explanation for discounting it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    based on his reasons, it is unclear whether the placement judge assessed
    the risk of future harm to R.S. and D.S. should they be returned to the appellant’s
    care.  Given the evidence at the placement hearing of the appellant’s past
    parenting conduct and her admitted awareness of at least some of the injuries
    sustained by her sons, this was a necessary and critical inquiry when crafting
    a placement that was in the children’s best interests.  The failure to undertake
    this risk assessment materially undercuts his con-clusion that it was in
    the children’s best interests that they be returned to their mother’s care.</p>
  <h2>IV.       Disposition</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appalling abuse of R.S. and D.S. is shocking and heart-wrenching.  Any placement
    order concerning them must be based on their best interests and the necessity
    to protect them from future harm.  Given those objectives, and the record
    before this court, I am compelled to conclude that a new placement hearing
    is required.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would set aside the orders of both the appeal judge
    and the placement judge and direct a new placement hearing before a different
    judge of first instance.  Pending the outcome of that hearing, I would direct
    that R.S. and D.S. remain in the care of the CAS, subject to such access
    rights in favour of the appellant as the CAS deems appropriate.  In the circumstances,
    I would make no order as to the costs of this appeal.</p>
