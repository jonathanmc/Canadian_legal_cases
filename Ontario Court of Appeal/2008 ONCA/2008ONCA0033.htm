    April 14, 2005, a Commission known as the Cornwall Public Inquiry was established
    pursuant to the <i>Public Inquiries Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 41 (“Act”).  Mr.
    Justice G. Normand Glaude of the Ontario Court of Justice was appointed as
    the Commissioner.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commission has been functioning for the better part of two years. After sorting
    out a host of preliminary matters, including the issue of which parties would
    be granted standing, the Commission began hearing evidence in mid-February
    2006. As of mid-July 2007, the Commission had heard from sixty-four witnesses,
    including eleven contextual expert witnesses, nineteen corporate officials
    representing various public institutions, twenty-eight alleged victims and
    six relatives of alleged victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    that backdrop, it is hard to believe that the Commissioner, his counsel and
    the parties would, at this late stage, be involved in a debate about the
    subject matter of the Inquiry and the breadth of the Commissioner’s mandate.
    And yet that is precisely the issue that lies at the core of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue has its genesis in the evidence of two witnesses, identified for privacy
    purposes as C12 and C13. Commission counsel seeks to lead their evidence
    before the Commissioner, while the appellants and the Attorney General for
    Ontario, as intervenor, seek to exclude it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a nutshell, the impugned evidence arises from an allegation by C12 that on
    December 8, 1993, when she was sixteen years old and living with her mother
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Alexandria,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint by two teenage boys. C12
    reported the matter to the police in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Alexandria the next day. If permitted to testify, C12 and her mother, C13,
    will speak about the abusive, insensitive and unprofessional treatment that
    C12 allegedly received at the hands of an officer of the Ontario Provincial
    Police who took her complaint and commenced the investigation. C12 will also
    speak about her loss of confidence in the police, her decision not to proceed
    with the charges and the emotional difficulties that she has suffered as
    a result of the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, led by the Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”), and the intervenor
    submit that the proposed evidence falls outside the ambit of the Commission’s
    mandate. They say that the phrase “allegations of historical abuse of young
    people” in the Order in Council (“OIC”) establishing the Commission restricts
    the subject matter of the Commission to allegations of abuse of young persons
    in the Cornwall area by persons who were in positions of trust or authority,
    and which were reported to a public institution a considerable time after
    the abuse occurred.   Commission counsel, on the other hand, submits that
    the subject matter of the Commission extends to all cases involving allegations
    of abuse of young people in the Cornwall area, including allegations of sexual
    assault such as those made by C12, so long as the allegations were made before
    April 14, 2005, the date on which the Commission was established.    </p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a hearing in which the parties set out their respective positions, the Commissioner
    determined that the subject matter of the Commission was the more expansive
    one urged by Commission counsel. In his written reasons dated June 16, 2007,
    the Commissioner refused a request under s. 6(1) of the Act to state a case
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    OPP and others then applied to the

w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

    to state such a case.  In the application to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, the appellants posed the following questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 1:  Do
    the Terms of Reference of the Cornwall Public Inquiry contemplate the hearing
    of evidence of an allegation of sexual assault on a 16 year old female by
    a 16 year old male and a 17 year old male which was reported to the police
    on the day following the alleged offence given the mandate of the inquiry
    to “…inquire into and report on the institutional response of the justice
    system … to allegations of historical abuse of young people…”?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 2:  In
    deciding to hear the evidence of C12 and C13, did the Commission of Inquiry
    properly exercise its jurisdiction or exceed its jurisdiction? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a split decision, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dismissed the application to direct the Commissioner to
    state such a case. The majority concluded that the Commissioner did not err
    in construing his mandate broadly. They further held that it was open to
    him to find that the evidence of C12 and C13 was “reasonably relevant” to
    the subject matter of the Inquiry. Accordingly, they declined to direct the
    Commissioner to state a case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H.
    Spiegel J., in dissent, came to the opposite conclusion. In his view, the
    Commissioner misconstrued the subject matter of the Commission and exceeded
    his jurisdiction in concluding that the proposed evidence of C12 and C13
    came within it. He would have allowed the application and answered the questions
    on the stated case as follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 1:    Is
    evidence of sexual abuse of a young person reported at or near the time it
    was alleged to have occurred reasonably relevant to the Terms of Reference
    given the mandate of the inquiry to “…
    inquire into and report on the institutional response of the justice system… to
    allegations of historical abuse …?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Answer:          No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 2:    In
    deciding to hear the evidence of C12 and C13 did the Commissioner properly
    exercise his jurisdiction or exceed his jurisdiction?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Answer:          The
    Commissioner exceeded his jurisdiction.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that the Commissioner
    erred in finding that the proposed evidence of C12 and C13 comes within the
    subject matter of the Commission. In so concluding, the Commissioner impermissibly
    redefined and expanded the scope of his mandate and committed jurisdictional
    error.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and would answer the questions
    on the stated case, as framed by the appellants, in the same manner as did
    Spiegel J. </p>

    begin my analysis by referring in more detail to the reasons of the Commissioner
    for refusing to state a case on the issue whether he had jurisdiction to
    hear the evidence of C12 and C13. The appellants’
    position before the Commissioner was that the term “historical abuse of young
    people” in para. 2 of the OIC restricts the scope of the Inquiry to situations
    where the abuse complained of occurred to a child, by a person in authority,
    and which was only reported to an institution much later.  In contrast, Commission
    counsel took the view that the word “historical” means abuse that occurred
    prior to April 14, 2005, the date of the OIC.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner concluded that the proposed evidence came within the subject
    matter of the Inquiry and for that reason it was within his jurisdiction
    to admit it. This conclusion is made clear at p. 4 of his reasons where he
    defined the issue confronting him as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Finally, I should
    note that the parties did make submissions with respect to relevance of the
    evidence in question. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    the question before me is <i>one of jurisdiction only</i> as relevance would
    go to issues such as admissibility generally and the weight to be given to
    such evidence, which is not the subject matter of a section 6 application.<a href="#_ftn2"

    reaching this conclusion, the Commissioner expressed the opinion that both
    of the competing interpretations of “historical” that were advanced by the
    parties “have merit and that they are not mutually exclusive but are quite
    compatible.”  He acknowledged that “the main focus of Parliament” in appointing
    the Inquiry “was to highlight the cases that had been in the spotlight in
    the community at the time of the decision to convene this Inquiry; hence,
    the reference to allegations of historical abuse.”  More will be said later
    in these reasons about the nature of the cases that were in the spotlight
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    identified the main focus of his mandate, the Commissioner was of the view

    of those particular cases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the
    view that while Parliament certainly indicated that historical allegations
    of abuse would be a central part of the Inquiry, the mandate certainly does
    not read to limit it to those specific cases. </p>

    the subject matter of the inquiry as set forth in the Order in Council”.  Instead,
    the majority took a deferential approach to reviewing the Commissioner’s

    Supt. McQuade’s affidavit also outlines the repercussions arising from these
    allegations, including charges that were laid
    “under the <i>Police Act</i>” against the Cornwall police officer who disclosed
    the pertinent information, as well as an ensuing civil action that the officer
    brought against a number of “named individuals and organizations including
    the former and current Chiefs of Police of the Cornwall Police Service”.
    According to Det. Supt. McQuade, in the context of his civil suit, the Cornwall
    police officer and his lawyer “began to collect information regarding other
    alleged victims of child sexual abuse, a clan of pedophiles in the Cornwall
    area, a conspiracy [by the priest and the probation officer] and their lawyer… in
    the fall of 1993, to murder [the officer] and the members of his family,
    and a conspiracy to obstruct justice in late summer 1993 by prominent members

    and the probation officer], the Crown Attorney, the Bishop of the Diocese
    and the Chief of Police”.</p>

    Police of the London Police Service in late 1996 and, by early 1997, it had
    found its way to the OPP and the Ministry of the Attorney General. Eventually,
    the Regional Director of Crown Attorneys for the Eastern Region of Ontario “requested

    which [the

    sexual abuse in the

    the Commissioner or the majority of the Divisional Court referred to the

    the institutional response to all allegations of abuse in the Cornwall area
    that pre-date April 14, 2005, including allegations of sexual assault such
    as those made by C12.  Rather, the legislative intention in ordering the

    defining the subject matter of the Inquiry in broad terms, the Commissioner
    paid particular attention to the first sentence of the preamble.  He mentioned
    this sentence in his reasons with a view to substantiating his conclusion
    that the legislature had chosen to give him a wide mandate. Thus, he noted
    that there was no reference in the preamble to “allegations of abuse at the
    hands of persons in authority” and that “the preamble clearly contemplates
    a general inclusive statement, not limited to historical allegations, but
    referring to ‘allegations of abuse of young people [that] have surrounded

    noted, that sentence narrows the so-called “general inclusive” allegations
    of abuse referred to in the first sentence to those that formed the subject
    matter of “police investigations and criminal proceedings related to these
    allegations [that] have concluded.”  Such allegations related to historical
    sexual abuse of young people in the Cornwall area by persons in authority

    the justice system and other public institutions, including the interaction
    of that response with other public and community sectors, in relation to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner noted that para. 2(b) contains no reference to “historical” abuse;
    rather, it refers to “policies and practices that were designed to improve
    the response to allegations of abuse”. In the Commissioner’s view, that provision,
    properly construed, calls for a “broad and liberal interpretation” as opposed
    to one that is restricted to “complaints [of historical abuse] reported by
    adults.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I believe that the Commissioner erred in reading para. 2(b) in isolation
    and in construing the words “allegations of abuse”
    differently from the words “allegations of historical abuse” used elsewhere
    in para. 2 and in other provisions of the OIC.  In my view, he should have
    construed those phrases harmoniously and with reference to the document as
    a whole. Had he done so, I am satisfied for several reasons that he would
    have treated the words “allegations of historical abuse” and “allegations
    of abuse” synonymously.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as I have already pointed out, the Commissioner misconstrued the words “allegations
    of abuse” in the first sentence of the preamble. Had he read those words
    in conjunction with the second sentence of the preamble, he would have realized
    that the “allegations of abuse” were the allegations of abuse that formed
    the subject matter of Project Truth, i.e. allegations of historical sexual
    abuse of young people in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Cornwall area by persons in authority or positions of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it must be noted that para. 2, although divided into sub-paragraphs, is one
    complete sentence.  Paragraph 2(b) must be read together with the language
    in para. 2(a) and with the concluding words in that provision, which refer
    both explicitly and implicitly to allegations of historical abuse.  Paragraph
    2(a) speaks of “allegations of <i>historical</i> abuse … including <i>the
    policies and practices then in place</i> to respond to such allegations”
    [Emphasis added.]. The concluding language of para.&nbsp;2 speaks of
    “recommendations directed to further improvement of the response <i>in similar
    circumstances</i>” [Emphasis added.]. Surely “similar circumstances” refers
    to allegations of historical abuse, as the appellant suggests, and not allegations
    of sexual assault of any kind, as Commission counsel suggests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Commissioner failed to have regard to para. 4 of the OIC.  Paragraph
    4 is a free-standing provision that provides for informal opportunities “for
    individuals affected by <i>the allegations of historical abuse</i> of young
    people in the Cornwall area” to express their views and feelings [Emphasis
    added.].  That provision dovetails with the third sentence in the preamble
    to the OIC and it reflects the view of community members that “a public inquiry
    will encourage individual and collective healing”. If the subject matter
    of the inquiry were meant to include allegations of sexual assault such as
    those made by C12, it is illogical that the legislature would have restricted
    the community meetings and other informal opportunities to “individuals affected
    by allegations of historical abuse of young people in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Cornwall area”. And yet, para. 4 is clearly restricted in that fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    para. 2 of the OIC is read as a whole and in conjunction with the other provisions
    of the OIC including the preamble, it is apparent that the legislature was
    directing the Commissioner to look at institutional policies and practices – past,
    present and future – in responding to allegations of historical abuse of
    young people in the Cornwall area.  Such allegations would include those
    that were the subject of the Project Truth investigation as well as any similar
    allegations of historical abuse of young people by persons in authority or
    positions of trust that were not investigated by Project Truth or that came
    to light after the Project Truth investigation ended.  This interpretation
    harmonizes the meaning of the word “allegations” throughout the OIC, including
    its meaning in the preamble, para. 2 and para. 4. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, reading para. 2(b) as the Commissioner does leads to the untenable
    conclusion that, by virtue of this clause, the legislature intended the Commissioner
    to compare and contrast present-day institutional responses to any and all
    allegations of abuse, including but not limited to the allegations of historical
    abuse, with past institutional responses limited solely to allegations of
    historical abuse under para. 2(a).  With respect, that interpretation is
    not logical.  Moreover, it isolates para. 2(b) and promotes it from a clause
    that describes one discrete component of the Commissioner’s mandate into
    a clause that single-handedly broadens his mandate beyond all proportions – something
    which in my view, the legislature did not contemplate. That leads me to the
    fourth error.</p>

    the mandate, it is clear that the main focus of Parliament was to highlight

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the
    view that while Parliament certainly indicated that historical allegations

line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner further observed that the Commission was “nearing the end of
    the victims’ evidence and it is not the intention of this Inquiry to now
    open the floodgates, or to widen the mandate that I have set to date.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, these words of the Commissioner do not sit well with the expansive
    view he took of his mandate. As already indicated, by interpreting the OIC
    as he did, the Commissioner ascribed to himself a mandate that is truly breathtaking
    in its scope. By defining the words
    “historical” as he did, the Commissioner gave himself jurisdiction to assess
    the response of various institutions (past, present and future), including
    the justice system, the police, Children’s Aid Societies and the like, to
    any and all allegations of sexual abuse made by young people in the Cornwall
    area, including historical allegations of abuse such as those investigated
    by Project Truth and allegations of sexual assault, such as those reported
    by C12, presumably from the date of Cornwall’s inception in 1834  to April
    14, 2005, the date on which the Commission was formed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a wide-ranging mandate is inconsistent with the Commissioner’s acknowledgement
    that the “main focus of Parliament was to highlight the cases that had been
    in the spotlight in the community at the time of the decision to convene
    this Inquiry; hence, the reference to allegations of historical abuse.” I
    fail to see how, on the Commissioner’s view of his mandate, he could reasonably
    hope to keep the floodgates from opening. If C12’s evidence (which falls
    outside the Commissioner’s view of the main focus of the Inquiry) were to
    be admitted, it would open the door to similar testimony from hundreds of
    complainants and their family members who might wish to come forward and
    speak of their experiences with the police and other institutions, both pro
    and con, not to mention the hundreds of judicial officers, police officers,
    CAS workers and the like who would no doubt wish to respond.</p>

    short, the Commissioner’s view of his mandate runs the risk of standing the
    so-called “main focus” of the Inquiry on its head and creating an unwieldy,
    if not unmanageable, mega-inquiry that could go on for years at great public
    expense.  Such an outcome would diminish the value to be gained from the
    important work that the legislature had assigned to the Commissioner.  </p>

    Commissioner made no finding on whether the evidence of C12 and C13 was reasonably
    relevant to the subject matter of the Inquiry. To be precise, he did not
    turn his mind to the issue, having concluded that their evidence came within
    his mandate and was thus clearly admissible.</p>

    circumstances where the Commissioner has not ruled on whether the proffered
    evidence is reasonably relevant to the subject matter of the Inquiry, I would
    normally refrain from commenting on whether the evidence is capable of passing
    the deferential test of “reasonably relevant” as set out in <i>Bortolotti</i>.
    However, the issue was canvassed by the parties in oral argument and I think
    it would be helpful to address it, in an effort to avoid further delays.</p>

    that the evidence of C12 and C13 stands alone and is not the prelude to an
    avalanche of other such evidence from like complainants and their family
    members, I fail to see how it could reasonably advance the inquiry that the
    Commission had been asked to perform. Without wishing to minimize the seriousness
    of C12’s complaint or the gravity of her allegations against the investigating
    officer, her evidence, if true, essentially comes down to one person having
    been treated inappropriately by a police officer in a case where she allegedly
    was sexually assaulted by other teenagers.  Her evidence does not speak to
    systemic problems that may or may not exist in the way police respond to
    allegations of sexual abuse of young people by persons in a position of trust
    or authority. In other words, it has no probative value in relation to the
    Commissioner’s mandate. </p>

line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, if C12’s evidence does not stand alone but is a prelude to
    an avalanche of similar evidence &#8722; the reception of which is likely
    to be very time-consuming, hotly contested and liable to deflect the Commissioner
    from the task at hand &#8722; any marginal probative value that such evidence
    might have would, in my view, be greatly outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
    As such, it would likewise not pass the
    “reasonably relevant” test. </p>

    so concluding, I do not wish to leave the impression that there can be no
    meaningful overlap, in so far as institutional responses are concerned, between
    cases such as the one described by C12 and the cases such as those investigated
    by Project Truth. Nor am I suggesting that allegations of historical sexual
    abuse of young people by persons in authority or positions of trust are a
    breed apart and entirely distinct from all other allegations of sexual abuse,
    including allegations of sexual assault committed by teenagers.  By way of
    example, studies that have explored the systemic responses of institutions
    such as the police to general allegations of abuse made by young people might
    well pass the reasonable relevance test, even though the subject matter of
    the study will not be precisely the same as the subject matter of this Inquiry. </p>

    these reasons, I am of the view that the proposed evidence of C12 and C13
    is not reasonably relevant to the subject matter of the Inquiry and should
    therefore not be received.   </p>

    conclusion, I would answer the questions in the stated case as framed by
    the appellants as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 1:  Do
    the Terms of Reference of the Cornwall Public Inquiry contemplate the hearing
    of evidence of an allegation of sexual assault on a 16 year old female by
    a 16 year old male and a 17 year old male which was reported to the police
    on the day following the alleged offence given the mandate of the inquiry
    to “…inquire into and report on the institutional response of the justice
    system … to allegations of historical abuse of young people…?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Answer:          No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Question 2:  In
    deciding to hear the evidence of C12 and C13, did the Commission of Inquiry
    properly exercise its jurisdiction or exceed its jurisdiction? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Answer:          The
    Commissioner exceeded his jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>                        Signed:           “M.J. Moldaver J.A.”</p>
  <p>                                                “I agree Doherty J.A.”</p>

    first question on the stated case as set out by Spiegel J. is worded slightly
    differently than the first question as framed by the appellants.  In the
    Commissioner’s factum filed with the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, he also framed questions that he would have stated in the
    event he were directed to do so by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  It is not necessary to set out these questions;  although
    the Commissioner included much more detail, the ultimate questions he raised
    do not differ in any significant way from the questions posed by the appellants.    </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[2]</span></span></span></a>   The
    Commissioner’s statement that matters of relevance, such as “admissibility
    generally and the weight to be given to such evidence” are “not the subject
    matter of a section 6 application” is not entirely accurate. As was held
    by this court in <i>Re Bortolotti et al. and the Ministry of Housing et al.</i>,
    discussed <i>infra</i>, such matters can give rise to jurisdictional error
    if the proposed evidence is not “reasonably relevant” to the subject matter
    of the inquiry.</p>

    will be said about these two sentences shortly. For now, I note that in his

    made no mention of the second sentence.</p>

    do not agree with the dissenting opinion of Spiegel J. to the extent that
    he concluded at para. 31 that the term “historical” in para. 2(a) of the
    OIC imports a requirement that there must necessarily be a lapse of time
    between the time of the abuse and the time of reporting for the allegation
    to be considered as historical.  </p>
