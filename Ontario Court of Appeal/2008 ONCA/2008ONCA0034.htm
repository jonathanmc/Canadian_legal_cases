    the Holding
    ‘H’ provision would be lifted in part “as individual site plans are approved

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 14, 2005, the Regional Municipality of York granted its approval of
    Official Plan Amendment No. 621, thereby approving the density increase to
    1,598 units for the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ primary ground of appeal is that the motion judge erred in finding
    that the density increase was approved in “final form” on March 14, 2005
    and that the bonus for the additional units was payable as a result.  The
    appellants submit that the clause is unambiguous but, as set out in their
    factum, should be interpreted as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… while the official plan amendment was adopted
    on March 14, 2005, thereby establishing a policy of increased coverage, that
    policy was not implemented concurrently by a zoning by-law as the latter
    was subject to an
    “H” or “hold” under s. 36 of the <i>Planning Act</i> [R.S.O. 1990, c. P-13].  The
    proposed density increase was ineffective until the “H” was removed.  The “H” was
    removed on February 26, 2007 in respect of 1,380 units and the vast bulk
    of the bonus is therefore payable on August 26, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants do not dispute that they must pay the bonus contemplated in clause
    5.01 of the Agreement for the 380 units (1,380 minus 1,000) no longer subject
    to a hold.  With respect to those units, the only issue is the timing of
    payment.  The appellants, however, maintain that the bonus for the other
    218 units (1,598 less 1,380) will not be triggered until the hold is removed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants further submit that if the clause is ambiguous, the motion judge
    erred in granting summary judgment where there are conflicts in the evidence
    of the planning experts called by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ position, which the motion judge accepted, is that the clause
    is unambiguous. The density increase to 1,598 had been granted in final form
    by all relevant governmental authorities on March 14, 2005 and the bonus
    was payable within six months of that date even though a hold under s. 36
    of the <i>Planning Act</i> was in place. The respondents submit that it is
    immaterial that the units subject to the hold could not actually be built
    until the “H” was removed by the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judge correctly concluded that this matter falls to
    be determined on the interpretation of the Agreement, specifically clause
    5.01 of the Agreement. The issue is whether the City of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Vaughan granted the density increase in final form on
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty’s initial application at the time the amendments and approvals described
    above were passed, thereby entitling the respondents to the bonus as set
    out in clause 5.01.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    find no ambiguity in the language of the Agreement and therefore we do not
    need to look to extrinsic evidence for interpretative aid.  It is not the
    role of judges to create ambiguity where none exists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    obligation to pay the bonus is triggered when the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan, with the consent of all relevant governmental authorities, grants
    the density increase in final form on reasonably satisfactory terms and conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement is silent in respect of any implementation issues.  As the respondents
    stated in their factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“H” removal is not part of, and has nothing to
    do with, the “initial Application” referenced in the Agreement, and it has
    nothing to do with density or an increase in density.  In short,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty has been granted its density rights for 1,598 residential units.
    Whether
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty implements or uses the density increase is a totally different issue
    which has nothing to do with triggering payment of the bonus under clause
    5.01(i) of the Agreement.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Liberty cannot utilize these density rights until individual site plans are
    approved by the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Vaughan, but those rights are there and remain there indefinitely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the terms of s. 5.01 of the Agreement requiring that “the City
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Vaughan, with the consent of all the relevant governmental authorities, has
    granted … the Density Increase on the initial Application [in final form]” were
    fulfilled when the Regional Municipality of York approved Official Plan Amendment
    No. 621 as previously adopted by the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Vaughan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading
    the Agreement as a whole, including the recital indicating that the appellants
    intended to apply for an Official Plan Amendment and a rezoning of the Property,
    we conclude that the phrase “initial Application” as it appears in s. 5.01
    of the Agreement refers to the request for an Official Plan Amendment increasing
    the maximum permitted number of units for the property. The fact that Amendment
    No. 621 stipulates that certain conditions must be fulfilled prior to the
    issuance of any building permits does not detract from the conclusion that
    approval of the density increase in final form has been granted on reasonably
    satisfactory terms and conditions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows therefore that there are no material facts in dispute requiring a

    respondents cross-appeal the motion judge’s disposition of costs and seek
    an increased amount. They point to no error in principle but suggest a more
    reasonable figure would be $50,000 plus disbursements and G.S.T. as opposed
    to the all inclusive sum of $30,000 awarded by the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    awarding of costs is a matter within the motion judge’s discretion and absent

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
