style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not pursue his appeal regarding spousal support but argues
    that the trial judge erred in proceeding in a procedurally unfair manner
    and in his award of support for the two children of the marriage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant seeks a new trial on the basis that he was denied procedural fairness.  He
    makes two points.  First, he argues that the trial judge proceeded to award
    Guidelines’ support when the respondent had not made formal application for
    that relief.  Second, he argues that the trial judge ought to have provided
    him with an opportunity to examine Jessica, the youngest child, about her
    income and expenses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the first point, the appellant is correct that there was no formal application
    for increased child support on the basis of the appellant’s increased income.  However,
    the trial judge rejected the appellant’s argument that there should be a
    separate and later hearing on that issue.  It is implicit in his observations
    during the trial and in his reasons that the trial judge was satisfied the
    appellant would suffer no prejudice from a consideration of increased support
    at the same time as he considered the appellant’s request to terminate child
    support in its entirety.  We agree for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant was aware from the outset that the respondent would seek increased
    child support if she was required to proceed to litigation.  She said so
    in her initial letter to the appellant and it was confirmed when her lawyer
    wrote the respondent in December 2003.  His letter sought disclosure of the
    appellant’s income tax returns and specified an increase in the child support
    payable under the parties’ separation agreement commensurate with the appellant’s
    increased income.  Second, the discoveries proceeded on the basis that the
    appellant’s increased income was relevant to child support.  Third, the appellant
    served an affidavit two months before the trial specifying that she sought
    child support based on the appellant’s increased income.  Fourth, the parties
    appear to have operated on the premise that they would not formally amend
    court documents, but would delineate the issues at the commencement of trial.  This
    is apparent from the record, including a letter from the appellant’s counsel
    seeking the respondent’s lawyer’s consent to dispense with formal amendments
    to save expense.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, at trial the appellant counsel’s primary argument was that the
    parties were bound by the amount of child support set out in the separation
    agreement and, for that reason, the appellant’s current income was irrelevant.  When
    the appellant’s counsel expressed his view that the only issue was support
    under the separation agreement, the respondent’s counsel immediately intervened
    with his position that, throughout discoveries, the parties had discussed “in
    essence a counter application”, even if one had not been formally filed.  The
    trial judge ruled that counsel should examine the appellant about his current
    income and the parties’ could argue further about the parameters of the issues
    at the end of the trial.  The trial judge specifically referred to the need
    to avoid a bifurcated proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the same time, the trial judge commented that
    “a parent cannot contract out of child support obligations.”  From this,
    it would have been apparent to counsel that, subject to further argument,
    the trial judge was considering increasing child support above the level
    set out in the separation agreement.  While the parties did not file transcripts
    of submissions, it is evident the trial judge did consider support from a
    Guidelines’ perspective, based on the appellant’s increased income, and that
    he did not consider this prejudiced the appellant in any way.  Indeed, when
    the appellant’s counsel raised the issue during the initial stages of the
    trial, he agreed to leave the issue in the hands of the trial judge.  He
    did not request an adjournment, presumably because there was no need for
    one.  Moreover, on appeal, the appellant’s counsel did not argue any particular
    prejudice except to request a new trial to examine Jessica.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    difficulty with the request for a new trial to examine Jessica is that the
    appellant called Jessica as a witness at the trial (as well as the parties’ other
    daughter Sara) and examined her at length regarding the very issues of her
    income and expenses.  He is not entitled to a second chance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    while it is always preferable that issues be clearly delineated in formal
    pleadings, we see no prejudice to the appellant from the judge’s consideration
    of the issues of increased child support.  There was no basis upon which
    to adjourn the trial, particularly because an adjournment was not sought,
    and there was no further evidence that the appellant could have called at
    a subsequent trial that was not available at this trial or that would have
    changed the result.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the quantum of child support, the appellant’s basic position is that he should
    not be obliged to contribute to the support of a child who could obtain employment
    and pay her own way through university.  However, not only is this not an
    accurate statement of the law, the separation agreement that the appellant
    signed specifically provided for ongoing child support through one undergraduate
    degree.  Moreover, there was no provision in the agreement that would reduce
    Guidelines’ support by the amount of income the child was capable of earning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellant’s income increased from its $86,400 level at the
    time of the separation agreement in 2000 to $156,000 at the time of trial
    in 2006.  However, because the appellant refused to pay child support for
    the children from the fall of 2003, when they returned to live with their
    mother, both children, particularly Sara, obtained employment to pay for
    her expenses.  At the time, the mother’s income from employment was in the
    range of $32,000 annually.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant resisted his obligation to pay support because Sara rejected his
    view that she should maintain her factory job while she attended university.  At
    trial, consistent with his original position, the appellant argued that Sara
    should support her university education through her earnings as a waitress
    and by accumulating student loans.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected this argument and noted that, if accepted, Sara’s study
    time would be compromised and that she would be deprived of any time for
    the extracurricular activities common during a university education.  He
    also noted that Sara’s car expenses were necessary so that she could commute
    daily from her mother’s residence to her university in another city.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge determined that the appellant should participate with the respondent
    in providing room and board for Sara.  He applied the Guidelines to provide
    increased support for Sara from the date she attended university on a full-time
    basis.  However, the trial judge also recognized Sara’s means to contribute
    to her own support from her earnings.  He ordered substantially reduced child
    support during the summer months and decreased Sara’s support by fifty per
    cent during her final year of university.  He also assumed that Sara would
    pay her own tuition.  Accordingly, contrary to the appellant’s argument,
    the trial judge clearly took Sara’s earnings into account in arriving at
    his decision.  Given Sara’s age and circumstances and those of the parties’,
    we see no error in the award of child support for Sara. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of trial, Jessica was completing her last year of high school and
    intended to study early childhood education the next year while continuing
    to live with the respondent.  She earned part-time income from employment
    and produced a budget showing her projected expenses.  The trial judge determined
    that the respondent was entitled to support from the time Jessica returned
    to live with her in the fall of 2003 and continuing through trial and while
    she attended university.  The trial judge expressed the view that Jessica
    may earn enough income to pay for her tuition, without having to incur student
    loans as had been required of Sara.  He left it open for a reconsideration
    of s. 7 expenses once Jessica started to attend her post-secondary education.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no error in the trial judge’s determination of support for Jessica.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in awarding costs to the
    respondent. While it would have been helpful if the trial judge&rsquo;s reasons
    on this issue had been somewhat more extensive, the fact is that the respondent
    was substantially more successful at trial than the appellant. The appellant
    had sought to be relieved of his obligation to pay the remains of the outstanding
    spousal support and to terminate support for his two children once they attained
    the age of 18. He was unsuccessful. In addition, the trial judge was entitled
    to take into account the respondent&rsquo;s offer to settle. In these circumstances,
    we see no error in the trial judge&rsquo;s exercise of discretion to award
    costs to the respondent of $10,000 plus disbursements and Goods and Services
    Tax.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent is entitled to costs of the appeal fixed in the agreed-upon amount
    of $4,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. </p>
