    deceased and his spouse jointly owned a life insurance policy.  The policy
    provides that on the death of one, the other is entitled to a lump sum payment
    of $109,000.  The deceased made inadequate provision for his dependants.  Can
    the lump sum be used to provide support for his dependants pursuant to the
    provisions of the <i>Succession Law Reform Act</i>?  This appeal addresses
    that question.</p>

    Ogilvie died on March 24, 2005.  He was survived by six children, three of
    whom are minors: Malachi Madore-Ogilvie, Ackil Ogilvie and Novlette Ogilvie.  The
    three minors and the deceased’s widow, Mary Kulwartian, (also known as Mary
    Ogilvie and so referred to as), qualify as the deceased’s dependants under
    the <i>Succession Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26 (“<i>SLRA”)</i>.</p>

    was just over two years of age at the time this matter was initially heard.  He
    lives in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa with his mother, Stephanie Madore, and his mother’s two other dependant
    children.  Ms. Madore’s evidence is that she has been unemployed since August
    2003 and has no means of ensuring support for Malachi.  Her income is limited
    to social assistance and baby bonus.  Her monthly expenses are $3,500, of
    which she attributes $1,480 to Malachi.   </p>

    was 12 years of age at the time of the initial applications.  He was born
    in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    and lives there with his single mother, Denise Chambers, whose annual income
    of approximately $2,000 comes from braiding people’s hair, work which she
    performs from her home.  Ms. Chambers estimates that her monthly expenses,
    including those attributable to Ackil, are $600 Canadian.  She would like
    to be able to send Ackil to a private school but is unable to pay the annual
    fees of $1,020 Canadian.  </p>

    was 13 at the time of the applications.  She lives with her mother, Mary
    Ogilvie, in the matrimonial home.  By virtue of the right of survivorship,
    Mary Ogilvie owns the matrimonial home; however, the mortgages on the home
    are approximately equal to its value.</p>

    the time the applications were heard, Mary Ogilvie was employed as a legal
    secretary, earning approximately $33,000 per year.  As well, she receives
    Canada Pension Plan benefits of $195 per month for Novlette.  These benefits
    arise because Novlette is the deceased’s daughter.  Mary Ogilvie hopes to
    take in foreign students as boarders to generate additional income.  </p>

    his will, Lloyd Ogilvie left his estate to his wife, Mary Ogilvie, but if
    she predeceased him or survived him for thirty days or less, his estate was
    to go to Novlette.  He made little provision for Malachi or Ackil while he
    was alive.  He made no provision for them on his death.    </p>

    Lloyd Ogilvie died, Malachi brought an application under the <i>SLRA</i>,
    claiming dependant’s relief from the deceased’s estate.  Ackil brought a
    cross-application against the estate in which he, too, claimed relief as
    a dependant.  Mary Ogilvie also brought a cross-application, on which more
    is said later.  (The application and two cross-applications are collectively
    referred to as the “applications”.)    </p>

    were potentially available to provide support for his dependants.  The first
    policy, of which the deceased was the sole owner, had a value of $60,711.  Mary
    Ogilvie was the named beneficiary of the first policy.  The parties agreed
    that the first policy could be deemed part of the deceased’s estate for the
    purpose of dependants’ relief under the <i>SLRA</i>.  However, as discussed
    more fully below, Mary Ogilvie disputed the claim that Malachi and Ackil
    had not been adequately provided for.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second policy, valued at $109,000, was jointly owned by the deceased and
    Mary Ogilvie (the “second policy” or the
    “jointly owned policy”).  It was a “joint flex term” policy, payable to the
    survivor on the death of the joint owner.  It had been taken out to secure
    payment of the first mortgage on the jointly owned matrimonial home.  The
    unrefuted evidence was that Mary Ogilvie made the majority, if not all, of
    the payments on the second policy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    means of her cross-application, Mary Ogilvie sought an order directing the
    insurance company to pay to her the proceeds of both policies.  She acknowledged
    that the first policy could be charged for dependant’s relief but maintained
    that the circumstances did not warrant such relief.  She asserted that each
    of the minor children was entitled to receive a pension from the Canada Pension
    Plan of $195 per month until age 18.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    in the circumstances.  As well, she claimed entitlement to the proceeds of
    the second policy, arguing that it could not be deemed to be part of the
    deceased’s estate for the purpose of dependant’s relief.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applications judge held that the second policy was caught by s. 72(1)(f)
    of the <i>SLRA</i>.  He reasoned as follows.  The <i>SLRA </i>is remedial
    legislation enacted to enable the court to provide support for a person’s
    dependants for whom inadequate provision has been made.  The deceased was
    a joint owner of the second policy and had all the incidents of ownership.  The
    only basis for finding that the second policy did not come within s. 72(1)(f)
    would be to read in the requirement that the policy be “solely” owned by
    the deceased.  Given the purpose of the <i>SLRA</i>, in his view, such an
    interpretation would not be correct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the applications judge deemed the second policy to be part of the estate
    for the purpose of funding a dependants’
    support order.  He ordered that the net proceeds<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    shares for the support of the three minor children only.  Each share was
    to be used to purchase an annuity which would provide monthly income to each
    minor dependant until he or she reached the age of 18.    </p>

    Divisional Court (McCartney and Whitten JJ.) allowed the appeal in part (the “Order”)
    and excluded the second policy from the deceased’s estate.  Based largely
    on s. 199(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, the majority
    reasoned that jointly held insurance policies do not form part of the estate
    of a deceased for the purpose of dependant support under the <i>SLRA</i>.  Associate
    Chief Justice Cunningham dissented.  He held that the applications judge
    was correct in concluding that, pursuant to s. 72(1)(f) of the <i>SLRA</i>,
    the deceased owned the second policy and that the <i>SLRA </i>provisions
    prevailed over s. 199(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.</p>

    Divisional Court refused to disturb the balance of the judgment of the applications
    judge.  In para. 15 of the majority reasons, it was said to have been agreed
    that exclusion of the second policy from the deceased’s estate would “eclipse” any
    further claim by Mary Ogilvie to the estate.  And, in para. 1 of the majority
    reasons, it was stated that exclusion of the second policy meant any failure
    by the applications judge to address Mary Ogilvie’s dependancy, for the purpose
    of the support order, became academic.  By these statements, I understand
    the Divisional Court to mean that if the second policy is not part of the
    deceased’s estate, then Mary Ogilvie’s claim would fail because her resulting
    financial means (her income and the proceeds of the second policy of $109,000),
    would be much greater than those of the other dependants.       </p>

    heart of this appeal lies in the wording of s. 72(1)(f) and, most particularly,
    the meaning to be given to the word “owned”
    therein.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    word “owned” is not defined in the <i>SLRA</i>.  I accept that it is an elastic
    term and that the meaning to be given to it depends on the purposes to be
    served by s. 72(1).  (See <i>Goodis v. Goodis Estate</i>, [2002] O.J. No.
    4841 at paras. 25 - 28 (S.C.J.), relying on <i>Wynne v. Dalby </i>(1913),
    30 O.L.R. 67 (S.C. A.D.); reversed on appeal but not on the meaning of “owned” (2003),
    175 O.A.C. 271 (Div. Ct.))  However, in my view, on a proper interpretation
    of s. 72(1)(f), the jointly owned policy is not caught.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching this conclusion, I begin by noting that, on a plain reading of s.
    72(1)(f), it does not apply to the second policy.  That policy was not owned
    by the deceased; it was jointly owned by him and Mary Ogilvie.  Further,
    s. 72(1)(f) refers to a policy
    “effected on the life of the deceased” whereas the jointly owned policy was
    effected on the lives of both co-owners.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    it is important to keep in mind that Mary Ogilvie did not become entitled
    to the proceeds of the second policy because she was named as beneficiary
    of that policy.  Her entitlement flows from her status as an owner of the
    second policy.  At the instant of Lloyd Ogilvie’s death, her joint ownership
    interest swelled to become an absolute entitlement to the proceeds of the
    second policy.  To interpret s. 72(1)(f) so as to capture the proceeds of
    the second policy would be to give the court the authority to take property
    belonging to Mary Ogilvie, a third party who has no obligation to provide
    support for the deceased’s dependants.  As was said in <i>Modopoulos v. Breen
    Estate</i> (1996), 15 E.T.R. (2d) 128 at para. 25 (Gen. Div.), the court
    cannot “reach into the hands of a third party” in order to make provision
    for someone else’s dependants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    make the proceeds of the second policy available for the support of dependants
    to whom Mary Ogilvie owed no duty is tantamount to expropriation.  It is
    presumed that the legislature does not intend to interfere with the property
    rights of citizens unless the statute clearly so provides. (See Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan
    and Driedger on the Construction</i> <i>of Statutes, 4<sup>th</sup> ed</i>.
    (
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    ON: Butterworth, 2002) at 399-403.)  The wording of s. 72(1)(f) does not
    meet the requisite level of clarity.  This is particularly evident when s.
    72(1)(f) is contrasted with ss. 72(1)(c) and (d).        </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections
    72(1)(c) and (d) read as follows:</p>
  <p>(c)       money deposited, together with interest thereon, in an account
    in the name of the deceased and another person or persons and payable on
    death under the terms of the deposit or by operation of law to the survivor
    or survivors of those persons with any bank, savings office, credit union
    or trust corporation, and remaining on deposit at the date of the death of
    the deceased;</p>
  <p>(d)       any disposition of property made by a deceased whereby property
    is held at the date of his or her death by the deceased and another as joint
    tenants;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    consideration of ss. 72(1)(c) and (d) assists in two ways. First, those provisions
    demonstrate that when the legislature wished to capture jointly owned property
    - whether a bank account (s. 72(1)(c)) or real property (s. 72(1)(d))<span class="HeadingNumber" style="text-align:left;
line-height:normal"><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></a></span></span> - it used express language to accomplish that
    goal. In s. 72(1)(f), there is no reference to an insurance policy &ldquo;in
    the name of the deceased and another&rdquo;, as in s. 72(1)(c), nor to an
    insurance policy that is &ldquo;held
    by the deceased and another&rdquo;, as in s. 72(1)(d). Instead, s. 72(1)(f)
  speaks only of a policy of insurance &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by the deceased.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    their location in the same subsection of the <i>SLRA </i>is significant.  Had
    the legislature intended to capture jointly owned insurance policies, it
    would have been a simple matter to have included language in s. 72(1)(f)
    similar to that in ss. 72(1)(c) or (d). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    an interpretation of s. 72(1)(f) that would encompass the jointly owned policy
    is not consistent with the overall scheme of s. 72, which is to capture property
    owned by the deceased.  When the legislature intended to “trap” jointly owned
    property for the purpose of dependant relief, it did so expressly (as explained
    above) and, by means of s. 72(2), with due regard for the interest of the
    co-owner.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    72(2) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>                        (2)       The capital value of the transactions referred to
    in clauses (1) (b), (c) and (d) shall be deemed to be included in the net
    estate of the deceased to the extent that the funds on deposit were the property
    of the deceased immediately before the deposit or the consideration for the
    property held as joint tenants was furnished by the deceased.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    can be seen that s. 72(2) is the statutorily prescribed mechanism for protecting
    the interest of the co-owner of property.  It ensures that only the deceased’s
    funds, or the consideration furnished by the deceased for the property held
    in joint tenancy, is deemed to be part of the deceased’s estate for the purpose
    of dependant relief orders.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    its terms, s. 72(2) does not apply to s. 72(1)(f).  It would be strange indeed
    if the legislation took pains to protect the rights of a joint owner in bank
    accounts (s. 72(1)(c)) and in real property (s. 72(1)(d)) but did nothing
    to protect the rights of a joint owner of an insurance policy, had it intended
    to catch the latter.  It would have been a simple matter to have expanded
    the list in s. 72(2) to refer to clause (f), as well as clauses (1)(b), (c)
    and (d).          </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    view that s. 72(1)(f) does not extend to capture jointly owned insurance
    policies is reinforced by reference to the overall intent of s. 72 of the <i>SLRA</i>.  In <i>Moores
    v. Hughes</i> (1981), 37 O.R. (2d) 785 at 789 (H.C.J.), Robins J. (as he
    then was) described that intent in these terms:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>Manifestly, [s. 72] was intended to ensure that the maintenance
    of a dependant is not jeopardised by arrangements made, intentionally or
    otherwise, by a person obligated to provide support in the eventuality of
    his death.  It is designed to alleviate the hardship that can be visited
    on a dependant by causing money or property to pass directly to a beneficiary
    (donee or joint tenant) and not as part of the estate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second policy was not an arrangement that was made to jeopardise the maintenance
    of the deceased’s dependants.  Given the financial circumstances of the deceased
    and Mary Ogilvie, the second policy was a reasonable and sensible measure
    to ensure that the survivor of the two had the capacity to pay the first
    mortgage on the matrimonial home.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    did the second policy have the effect of jeopardising the deceased’s dependants.  It
    did not make monies unavailable to the dependants that would otherwise have
    been available to them – recall that Mary Ogilvie paid most, if not all,
    of the costs of the second policy.  Had the second policy not existed, there
    would have been no additional assets available for his dependants.  In fact,
    it can be argued that the second policy was beneficial from the perspective
    of the dependants as, had Mary Ogilvie died first, the proceeds of the second
    policy would have given the deceased greater means with which to provide
    for his dependants.  </p>

    the concern expressed in the above-quoted passage from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Moores</i><i> </i>relates to hardship visited on a deceased’s dependants “by
    causing money or property to pass directly to a beneficiary”.  As has been
    noted, the insurance proceeds go to Mary Ogilvie by virtue of her ownership
    rights in the policy, not as a beneficiary.</p>

    the facts of the present case are meaningfully different from those in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Moores</i>.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Moores</i>, the question was whether the deceased “owned” a group insurance
    policy within the meaning of s. 72(1)(f).  Although the policy was not strictly
    owned by the deceased, in the sense that it was issued to or held by him,
    the court concluded that s. 72(1)(f) applied because the policy covered the
    deceased, it was on his life, payment for the policy had been made on his
    behalf by the company, and the deceased could name the beneficiary.  Contrast
    that with the present case where the policy was on the lives of both the
    deceased and Mary Ogilvie, payment for the policy had been made primarily,
    if not completely by Mary Ogilvie, and the policy was structured so that
    the beneficiary was the survivor of the two insureds.  </p>

    a plain reading of s. 199, it is directed at the “rights and interests of
    the insured in the contract” and operates in the following fashion.  One
    person owns a policy (the “insured”) which provides that, on the death of
    the insured, a named person is to have the insured’s rights and interests
    in the policy.  When the insured dies, the named person (not the insured’s

    determine entitlement to the proceeds of a life insurance policy.  Mr. MacNab
    bought an annuity and named his wife as beneficiary.  The policy guaranteed
    payments for 16 years to him and, on his death, to his wife, Ms. MacNab.  After
    he died, Ms. MacNab executed an appointment of beneficiary which directed,
    on her death, that the proceeds under the policy were to go to her niece
    and sister-in-law.  Under the terms of Ms. MacNab’s will, bequests were made
    to certain charities.  When Ms. MacNab died, her niece and sister-in-law
    claimed the proceeds of the annuity.  The Public Trustee argued that the
    appointment was invalid and that the proceeds of the annuity ought to go
    to the named charities.  </p>

    on s. 199(1)(b), the court held that Ms. MacNab had the rights and interests
    that Mr. MacNab had in the insurance policy, including the right to name
    new beneficiaries.  Thus, her <i>inter vivos </i>designation of beneficiaries
    was operative, with the result that the insurance proceeds did not form part
    of her estate.  Instead, they were paid to Ms. MacNab’s niece and sister-in-law.         </p>

    is important to note that s. 199 does not purport to deal with the proceeds
    of an insurance policy.  The <i>Insurance Act </i>treats rights in an insurance
    policy differently from the right to receive the proceeds of an insurance
    policy.  A review of s. 196 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, by way of contrast
    to s. 199, illustrates this difference in treatment.  Section 196 reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p><b>196. </b>(1)          Where a beneficiary is designated, the insurance
    money, from the time of the happening of the event upon which the insurance
    money becomes payable, is not part of the estate of the insured and is not
    subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured.             </p>
  <p>         (2)          While a designation in favour of a spouse, child,
    grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, or any of them, is
    in effect, the rights and interests of the insured in the insurance money
    and in the contract are exempt from execution or seizure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    can be seen that whereas s. 199 addresses the rights of the insured in the
    insurance contract, s. 196 is directed primarily at the money payable under
    an insurance policy.  And, in s. 196(2), the rights and interests of the
    insured in the contract are mentioned separately from the rights and interests
    of the insured to the insurance money.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the foregoing interpretation of s. 199, it is apparent that it does not apply
    to the jointly owned policy.  It goes without saying that it is the right
    to the money payable under the jointly owned policy that is in issue in these
    proceedings, rather than any other rights in that policy.  Mary Ogilvie was
    not a person “named in the contract” – she and the deceased were the insureds
    and owners.  Mary Ogilvie’s right to the proceeds of the second policy flow
    from her ownership of the policy, albeit joint ownership.  On the death of
    Lloyd Ogilvie, by the terms of the contract, Mary Ogilvie is solely entitled
    to the proceeds of the policy
    – not to rights in the contract.       </p>

    of the argument on s. 199(1) was focussed on the meaning to be attributed
    to the introductory words in that section –
    “Despite the <i>Succession Law Reform Act</i>”.  In my view, that question
    is more properly addressed in the context of a situation where s. 199 has
    been found to apply to a policy of insurance.    </p>

    Ogilvie concedes that the first policy, which was owned solely by the deceased,
    was properly deemed to form part of the deceased’s estate pursuant to s.
    72(1)(f) of the <i>SLRA</i>.  However, in the cross-appeal, she argues that
    the applications judge erred in charging the proceeds of the first policy
    for support for the dependant children and that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court failed to correct that error.  The essence of her argument
    is that it was unreasonable to make the support order because, had the deceased
    remained healthy and working, he would have been legally obliged to pay child
    support of $159 per month for each of the two appellants, a lesser sum than
    $195 per month, which is the amount that Mary Ogilvie maintains the appellants
    are entitled to receive from the Canada Pension Plan.    </p>

    see no basis on which to interfere with the applications judge’s exercise
    of discretion in ordering support for the three dependant children.  The
    first policy falls squarely within s. 72(1)(f) of the <i>SLRA</i> and is,
    therefore, available for the purpose of an order for dependant support.  As
    the applications judge noted, the parties agreed that Mary Ogilvie and each
    of the three minor children are dependants of the deceased and that the deceased
    had failed to make adequate provision for the proper support of the three
    minor dependants.  The applications judge also considered the circumstances
    of each of the dependants as required by s. 62(1) of the <i>SLRA</i>.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Thus, it can be seen that the applications judge
    properly followed the scheme of the <i>SLRA</i>.
     He made the necessary determinations and, pursuant to the power conveyed
    on him by s. 58(1),<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    and the circumstances of each dependant, exercised his discretion and made
    provision for the minor dependants by dividing the estate assets among them.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it would have been preferable had the applications judge expressly addressed
    the cross-appellant’s submission that the appellants would be adequately
    provided for by means of the Canada Pension Plan benefits, that oversight
    does not amount to an error warranting this court’s intervention for two
    reasons.  First, it is far from clear that the appellants are entitled to
    receive benefits under the Canada Pension Plan in the same way that Novlette
    does.  The sole support for this proposition is the statement in Mary Ogilvie’s
    affidavit that she believes that Malachi could make such a claim to the Canada
    Pension Plan.  There was no evidence – or even suggestion – that Ackil, a
    citizen and resident of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    , is entitled to claim or receive such benefits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    even if the appellants were entitled to receive Canada Pension Plan benefits
    in the amount of $195 per month, the fact that this amount exceeds the child
    support that the deceased would have been obliged to pay is not, in itself,
    a basis on which to interfere with the exercise of the applications judge’s
    discretion in the quantum of support ordered for the minor dependants.  The
    jurisprudence makes it clear that the applications judge was not limited
    to providing relief at a level consistent with the deceased’s legal obligations.     In <i>Tataryn
    v. Tataryn Estate</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 807, the Supreme Court of Canada held
    that the court has a broad discretion in making such orders and that the
    quantum of dependant support is not limited to an amount which meets a deceased’s
    legal responsibilities during his lifetime; in determining what is adequate
    and just, the testator’s moral duties are to be considered as well.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court recently considered the operation of s. 62(1) of the <i>SLRA</i> and
    reviewed the <i>Tataryn </i>decision.  Although the <i>Tataryn </i>case is
    based on
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia legislation, this court affirmed that moral considerations,
    as well as the needs and means of the dependants, continue to be relevant
    in the exercise of discretion under s. 62(1).  See <i>Cummings v. Cummings
    Estate </i>(2004), 69 O.R. (3d) 398 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Thus, the applications judge was not obliged to set dependant support
    based on the amount that the deceased would have been obliged to pay by way
    of child support.  In fact, limiting his discretion by considering only the
    deceased’s child support obligations would have been a breach of his obligation
    under s. 62(1) of the <i>SLRA</i> to consider the broad range of enumerated
    factors when determining the amount and duration of support.  Given the applications
    judge’s findings on the dependants’ respective financial circumstances, he
    was amply justified in making the order that he did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    seems to me that the cross-appeal is brought, at least in part, because the
    applications judge did not expressly say why he chose to allocate all of
    the estate assets for the support of the minor dependant children and none
    for the support of Mary Ogilvie.  While not stated explicitly, a full reading
    of the reasons shows that the applications judge made no order of support
    in favour of Mary Ogilvie – despite the fact that she, too, was a dependant
    - because she had other sources of income available for her support which
    were far in excess of those available to the other dependants.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  Even the most cursory reading of s. 62(1) makes
    it clear that such a determination justifies a support order that excludes
    her.  While it is unfortunate that there are insufficient assets to adequately
    provide for any of the dependants, in the circumstances of this case, it
    does not amount to an error in the exercise of the applications judge’s discretion
    to use the limited assets for the benefit only of the minor dependants.</p>

    and in any event, as I would exclude the second policy from the deceased’s

    few assets in the estate apart from the insurance policies were consumed
    by the debts of the estate.   Thus, with the agreement of the parties, the
    applications proceeded on the basis that there were no assets in the estate
    apart, possibly, from the two insurance policies.  </p>

    parties operated on the premise that s. 72(1)(d) is directed at real property.  However,
    these reasons are not to be taken as having decided the point.  There is
    no need to decide the matter as, even if s. 72(1)(d) encompasses property
    other than real property, it could not apply to the present case because
    there was no “disposition of property”, as that phrase has been interpreted
    by the jurisprudence.  See <i>Modopoulos, supra</i>, and <i>Caughell (Litigation
    Guardian of) v. Caughell Estate (Trustee of) </i>(2000), 35 E.T.R. (2d) 1
