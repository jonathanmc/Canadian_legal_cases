    J. originally granted access to the appellant on terms specified in his judgment
    dated June 30, 2004.  The judgment was rendered after a trial on several
    issues, including the question of access.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently,
    on about July 7, 2004, counsel for the respondent sought a further hearing
    before Roy J. to raise an issue arising out of the alleged conduct of the
    appellant on his first visit with his children following the trial judgment.  Counsel
    for the respondent alleged in a letter written to the trial judge that the
    appellant had acted in a most inappropriate way towards his children during
    that visit.  He told the children that if his access was to be restricted,
    he did not want to see them at all.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    hearing requested by counsel for the respondent was eventually scheduled
    for August 11, 2004.  The appellant was aware of the nature of the allegations
    being made by counsel for the respondent and he was aware that a tentative
    appointment with the trial judge to address those allegations had been made
    for August 11<sup>th</sup>.  The appellant apparently faxed his version of
    events to the trial judge.  The appellant attended at the courthouse on August
    11<sup>th</sup>, filed a written request for an adjournment based on the
    serious illness of his friend and business partner and then left the courthouse.  Roy
    J. elected to proceed with the hearing on August 11<sup>th</sup> in the appellant’s
    absence.  Based on the information provided to him, he was satisfied that
    he should vary the access order he had made at trial.  In the end, he ordered
    that the appellant should have no access other than by further order of the
    court.  It is clear to us that Roy J. anticipated that there may well be
    a further application by the appellant for access.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not seek any further order from the trial court, but instead
    launched an appeal, albeit in the wrong court.  The appellate process has
    wound on and the appellant eventually finds himself here some three and a
    half years after the order of Roy J.  He has not seen his children during
    that time period.  They are now fourteen and twelve, respectively.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no error in the order of Roy J. made on August 11<sup>th</sup>.  He had
    a legitimate basis for concern with respect to the continued access by the
    appellant and his order reflects that concern.  Roy J. obviously contemplated
    that the appellant could make a further application before him or another
    judge of the trial court to regain access if he wanted access where he could
    explain the relevant events.  As indicated earlier, no such application was
    ever made to the trial court.  We also note that apart from the first weekend,
    the appellant did not attempt to exercise his access rights between the end
    of June when the order was made and August 11<sup>th</sup> when the order
    was varied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we are satisfied that it was open to Roy J. to proceed in the face of the
    appellant’s written request for an adjournment.  Trial judges must exercise
    a discretion in determining whether to grant adjournments and, in our view,
    there was a basis upon which Roy J. could decline to adjourn the matter and
    proceed to make the order he did, particularly when he made an order which
    clearly gave the appellant the opportunity to come back before the court
    on the question of access if he so wished.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    were other grounds of appeal raised in the factum and briefly alluded to
    by the appellant.  We see no merit in those grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Costs
    to the respondent on the appeal in the amount of $7,000, inclusive of GST
    and disbursements.  That amount, as well as the three costs orders referred
    to in para. 28 of the respondent’s factum, may be payable out of the $12,000
    paid into court as security for costs by the order of Justice McWilliam on
    October 20, 2005.</p>
