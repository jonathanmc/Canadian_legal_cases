style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was convicted on charges of sexual exploitation, sexual interference,
    indecent act, gross indecency, sexual assault, and failure to comply with
    an undertaking. Following a preliminary inquiry, he pled guilty and was sentenced
    to two years imprisonment having regard to time served of 7.5 months for
    which he was given one year credit.   In addition, the sentencing judge ordered
    three years probation. The Crown is appealing this sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, the sentencing judge failed to appreciate the seriousness of
    the offences and the appropriate range of sentence for them. When the sentencing
    judge said, that in relation to the range of sentence suggested by the Crown,
    a “sentence of five to seven years in the penitentiary is overreaching a
    lot” for this type of offender and these offences, he was simply wrong.  Moreover,
    even for a first-time offender convicted of this type of offence taking place
    over a large number of years, the sentencing principles to be accorded the
    greatest weight are deterrence, denunciation and the separation of the offender
    from society: <i>R. v. D(D)</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (Ont. C.A.) at
    paras. 34-35.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead
    of placing the greatest weight on deterrence and denunciation, the sentencing
    judge emphasized rehabilitation.  He stated that the overriding sentencing
    principle is to “give first time offenders one chance to make it right”.
    He referred to this 44 year old man as “still pretty young” and indicated
    that he was going to fashion a sentence that would give him at least one
    opportunity to make it in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was a first offender because his historical criminal conduct had
    not been discovered and punished before he was charged with the first set
    of offences. He is not a person who committed an isolated criminal act that
    is entitled to greater leniency.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge also failed to properly appreciate the evidence of the psychiatrist
    and the extent to which the respondent was at risk to re-offend although
    he indicated that he was “troubled by the suggestion in the material” that
    the respondent did not understand how serious his offences were and that
    he lacked insight into the harm he had caused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Quite
    apart from the sentencing judge’s errors in principle, we are of the opinion
    that the sentence imposed is unfit.  The aggravating factors in this case
    include:</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    extreme youth of the victims when the abuse began, four, five and seven years
    old;</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    breach of trust involved, especially regarding the “K” children, in relation
    to whom the respondent stood in <i>loco parentis</i>;</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    lengthy period of time over which the offences took place, namely, five years
    in relation to three of the victims;</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>d.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    nature of the sexual assaults, which included repeated acts of digital penetration,
    forcing young children to touch his penis, and with respect to at least one
    of the victims – simulated intercourse;</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>e.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    magnitude of the harm caused to the child victims, including the separation
    of siblings from one another; and</p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>f.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    respondent’s breach of probation and the risk of recidivism posed by him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal as to sentence
    and in its place substitute a global sentence of five years imprisonment
    less credit of one year for presentence custody.</p>
