color:black'>On July 21, 2004 police executed a warrant issued pursuant to the <i>Controlled
        Drugs and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996 c. 19, empowering them to search
        a suburban address in
    <st1:City

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto. On entry, the house was found to be unoccupied. In the basement

color:black'>As one of the officers left the house to change into a protective
      suit in preparation to dismantle the grow operation, he noticed a van driven
      by the appellant pull into the driveway. The appellant, a Vietnamese immigrant,
      briefly stopped his van and then began to leave the driveway in reverse.
      The officer was wearing a vest with the word “Police” in large white letters.
      He approached the appellant’s van and stated “Police, stop”, whereupon
      the following conversation occurred:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US

color:black'>Following this conversation the officer arrested the appellant for
      production and possession of marijuana and advised him of his right to
      counsel. At trial the Crown relied, almost exclusively, on the appellant’s
      answers to the police officer to connect the appellant to the grow operation.
      The appellant was convicted of producing marijuana and sentenced to five
      months imprisonment.</span></p>

color:black'>The appellant brought an application under ss. 10(a), 10(b) and
      24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> to exclude his statement to the police. On
      the <i>voir dire</i>, the officer testified that he believed he had authority
      at common law to detain the appellant in the circumstances, but that he
      did not immediately inform the appellant of his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights
      because it would not make sense to extend the detention if the appellant
      was unconnected to the residence. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span

color:black'>The trial judge ruled that the appellant was detained when the police
      officer told him to “stop”, and that the appellant’s rights under s. 10
      of the <i>Charter</i> had been violated. However, after holding that <i>R.
      v. Mann</i> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) does not stand for the
      proposition that the police should be precluded, in these circumstances,
      from asking the question “do you live here?”, the trial judge found that
      exclusion of the appellant’s statement would destroy the balance between
      societal interests and privacy interests. Accordingly, the trial judge
      refused to exclude the appellant’s statement under s. 24(2) and dismissed
      the appellant’s application.</span></p>

color:black'>On appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
      to exclude his statement. He also seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>[7]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
color:black'>Subsequent to the filing of this appeal, this court rendered its
      decision in <i>R. v. Suberu</i> (2007), 218 C.C.C. (3d) 27. The appellant
      does not seriously contest that his allegation of a breach of s. 10(b)
      of the <i>Charter</i> is governed by this court’s decision in <i>Suberu</i>.
      However, he maintains that his rights under s. 10(a) were breached and
      that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude his statement.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span

color:black'>It is not contested that the oral statement of the appellant led
      to his conviction. Nor does the Crown contest that the officer did not
      comply with of s. 10(a) of the <i>Charter</i>,<i> </i>which requires that
      a detainee be advised of the reasons for arrest or detention “promptly”,
      and that there was no impediment to the officer’s ability to quickly inform
      the appellant of the reason for stopping him before asking him any questions
      concerning the residence. </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>We conclude that the oral statement
      made by the appellant should have been excluded from evidence under s.

color:black'>We wish to note at the outset that this case does not involve issues
      relating to whether the appellant was detained, whether any such detention
      was proper, or at what point the s. 10(b) right to counsel crystallizes,
      as have been explored in such recent cases as <i>R. v. Grant</i> (2006),
      209 C.C.C. (3d) 250 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Suberu</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v.
      Harris </i>(2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 214 (C.A.);  and <i>R. v. L.B. </i>(2007),
      86 O.R. (3d) 730 (C.A.). This case involves only the effect of failing
      to comply with the informational requirement of s. 10(a) of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>[12]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
color:black'>The above-noted cases did not consider the informational component
      of s. 10(a) at any length owing to the circumstances of each case. <i>Harris</i> involved
      a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and this court found that s. 10
      was not triggered. In <i>Suberu</i>, Doherty J.A. noted that the accused
      did not allege a breach of s. 10(a) because it was clear that he knew the
      general nature of the alleged offence for which he was detained. In <i>L.B.</i>,
      this court determined that the accused was not detained, and as a result
      s. 10(a) was not triggered. In <i>Grant</i>, the investigative detention
      of Mr. Grant on the street was prompted by his suspicious behaviour and
      was unrelated to the investigation of any particular crime. </span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>[13]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
color:black'>By contrast, in the present case the police had executed a search
      warrant and were in the process of investigating a grow-op. The appellant
      does not contest that he was properly subjected to investigative detention
      nor does the Crown contest that the appellant was detained. It follows
      that the questioning of the appellant was in the context of a heightened
      degree of criminal jeopardy, which demands that particular attention be
      paid to the informational component of s. 10(a).</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span

color:black'>The Crown has acknowledged that it would have been simple for the
      arresting officer to provide the appellant with the information that led
      to his detention. The officer could easily have said “Police, stop, we’re
      investigating a marijuana grow op in this house.”  However the Crown submits
      that the breach of the appellant’s s. 10(a) right<s>s</s> was so minor
      that the evidence of the oral statement ought not to be excluded.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span

color:black'>Given the Crown’s position, we believe it will assist in understanding
      our s. 24(2) analysis to first comment on the s. 10(a) <i>Charter</i> right
      that was violated in this case.</span></p>

color:black'>The right to be informed of the reasons for detention as enshrined
      in the <i>Charter</i> and the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> is a codification
      of the common law described most famously in the case of <i>Christie  v.
      Leachinsky</i>, [1947] A.C. 573 (H.L.). In <i>Christie</i>, the common
      law right was essentially described as follows: a person is entitled to
      be informed of the reason why he or she is being restrained, unless the
      circumstances are such that he or she knows why. The reasons do not need
      to be expressed in technical or precise language, but must, in substance,
      inform the person as to the reason why the restraint is being imposed.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>[17]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
color:black'>Canadian jurisprudence has since generally affirmed that s. 10(a)
      of the <i>Charter </i>captures that common law definition. In <i>R. v.
      Kelly</i> (1985), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 419, this court had occasion to comment
      on s. 10(a) and its relationship to s. 10(b). At p. 424 this court noted
      that:</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>The interest protected by paras. (a) and
      (b) are not the same. With respect to para. (a), a person is not obliged
      to submit to an arrest if he does not know the reason for it: <i>Christie
      et al. v. Leachinsky</i>, [1947] A.C. 573 at pp. 587-8. It is, accordingly,
      essential that he be informed promptly or immediately of the reasons. On
      the other hand, the relevant interest protected by para. (b) … is that
      of not prejudicing one’s legal position by something said or done without,
      at least, the benefit of legal advice. … While there may be good reasons
      why an arrested person’s right to be informed of his right to counsel should
      be “without delay”, there is no essential reason why it has to be part
      and parcel of the s. 10(a) statement, which is really part of the arresting
      process itself.</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>[18]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
color:black'>This court’s pronouncement in <i>Kelly</i> was later affirmed and
      expanded by the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in <i>R. v. Evans</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 289. McLachlin J. stated at
    p. 302:</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>The right to be promptly advised
      of the reason for one’s detention embodied in s. 10(a) of the <i>Charter</i> is
      founded most fundamentally on the notion that one is not obliged to submit
      to an arrest if one does not know the reasons for it: <i>R. v. Kelly</i> … A
      second aspect of the right lies in its role as an adjunct to the right
      to counsel conferred by s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. As Wilson J stated
      for the court in <i>R. v. Black</i> (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at p. 12, … “[a]n
      individual can only exercise his s. 10(b) right in a meaningful way if
      he knows the extent of his jeopardy”. In interpreting s. 10(a) in a purposive
      manner, regard must be had to the double rationale underlying the right.</span></p>

color:black;'>Most recently, Iacobucci J. made it clear in <i>Mann</i>, <i>supra </i></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;color:black'>at para. 21, that detention, for purposes of s. 10(a) of
      the <i>Charter</i>, includes individuals who are detained for investigative
      purposes:</span></p>
  <p class=Mainparagraph><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>Section 10(a) of the <i>Charter</i> provides
      that “[e]veryone has the right on arrest or detention to be informed promptly
      of the reasons therefor”. At a minimum, individuals who are detained for
      investigative purposes must therefore be advised, in clear and simple language,
      of the reasons for the detention.</span></p>

color:black;'>It is clear, therefore, that while the main purpose of s. 10(a)
      is to inform an individual of why he or she is being detained, it also
      has an important secondary aspect as </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>an adjunct to the right to counsel conferred
      by s. 10(b). Specifically, the purpose of s. 10(a) is also to inform an
      individual of the extent of his or her jeopardy such that he or she can
      exercise the right to counsel conferred by s. 10(b) in a meaningful way.
      The purpose of s. 10(b), in turn, is to ensure that an individual subject
      to detention or arrest understands his or her right to silence and can
      make a meaningful choice about whether to exercise it: <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990),
      57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). As to the difference in language between s.
      10(a) and 10(b), I return to this court’s holding in <i>Kelly</i> at p.
      424:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>First, it may be noted that s. 10(a) uses
      the word “promptly” and s. 10(b) does not. While semantically there may
      appear to be little difference between “promptly” and “without delay” I
      think there is a subtle difference between them. The former is a positive
      term and, I think, does mean “immediately” while the latter does not quite
      have this connotation. The injunction of the latter is expressed in negative
      terms – not to delay, or postpone, which does not necessarily convey the
      notion of immediacy. Further, if the same temporal requirement was intended
      to be equally applicable to each clause then it is reasonable to think
      that the same word or words would have been used in each.</span></p>

color:black'>Once detained, an individual is at the mercy of state actors. Thus,
      in circumstances where the informational component of s. 10(a) of the <i>Charter </i>is
      easy to fulfill – as it was in this case – the breach of the obligation
      to provide that information cannot be considered a trivial matter. We say
      this because, as the jurisprudence illustrates, the right against self-incrimination
      is fundamental to the spirit of s. 10 of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>

      in this case. The violation of that right gave rise to the very evidence

      In that case, Justice Arbour noted at para. 44 that “judicial adjudication

      judge clearly identified the appellant’s statement as conscriptive evidence
      in finding a s. 10 <i>Charter</i> breach, he failed to consider the impact
      of the admission of such evidence on trial fairness in his s. 24(2) analysis.

      v. Orbanski</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), LeBel J. concluded
      that where an accused was given incomplete information about his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights
      but nevertheless understood them and declined to exercise them before making
      a self-incriminating statement, the effect of the <i>Charter</i> breach
      was minor and did not go to trial fairness. In <i>Grant</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      Laskin J.A. concluded that because there were no reliability concerns in
      relation to the conscriptive real evidence in issue, and because the police
      conduct that led to its production was not flagrant, the impact on trial
      fairness of the evidence “would not have been so great that it preclude[d]

color:black'>Unlike <i>Orbanski</i> and <i>Grant</i>, in our view, there are
      no factors present in this case that mitigate the deleterious effect of
      the conscriptive evidence on trial fairness. The appellant was given no
      advice about his right to counsel or about why he was being detained. Moreover,
      nothing about the officer’s initial question suggested that answering that
      question could give rise to criminal jeopardy. In these circumstances,
      the appellant had no basis for making an informed choice about whether
      or not to answer the officer’s question. </span></p>

color:black'>Further, unlike <i>Grant</i>, the statement the appellant gave to
      the police does not bear the hallmarks of reliability associated with real
      evidence: see <i>Grant</i> at para. 54. Finally, unlike <i>Grant</i>, there
      is no suggestion that the officer in this case did not think he had detained
      the appellant. On the contrary, the officer specifically ordered the appellant
      to stop. Even assuming that the officer did not intentionally breach the
      appellant’s s.10(a) <i>Charter</i> rights, those rights were engaged and
      could easily have been respected.</span></p>

color:black'>The result in this case is that the question posed by the officer,
    “Do you live here?”, compromised the appellant’s right against self-incrimination.
    Because the answer provided by the appellant, namely, “Umm, yeah, yes”, resulted
    in his conviction, our view is that the admission of this oral statement
    rendered the appellant’s trial unfair. As there are no factors present that
    mitigated the effect on trial fairness of admitting this conscriptive evidence,
    we conclude that failing to exclude this statement would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute. Therefore, the appellant’s statement must be excluded
    under s. 24(2).</span></p>

    the effect that, following the appellant’s arrest, the arresting officer
