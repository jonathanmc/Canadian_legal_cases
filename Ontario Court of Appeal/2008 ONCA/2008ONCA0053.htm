    is a medical malpractice action in which experts were called on both sides
    to testify as to the appropriate standard of practice of obstetricians in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario in 1995.  <span style='color:black'>At trial, the appellants were
    unable to prove that Dr. Robins’ negligent failure to obtain informed consent
    to a mid-forceps baby delivery legally caused the damages alleged. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>After
      reviewing the evidence, the trial judge held that the forceps delivery
      caused the appellants’ son’s brachial plexis injury and brain damage.  </span>He <span style='color:black'>found
      that Mr. and Mrs. Cruz should have been consulted and had disclosed to
      them the option of a caesarean section and its risks.  Further, he found
      that they should have been advised of the risks involved in proceeding
      with a mid-forceps delivery.  Nevertheless, the trial judge concluded that
      had the appellants been advised and given the choice, the same result would
      have occurred.  In the trial judge’s words:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[81]     [Dr. Robins’] failure to seek and obtain
    informed consent is of no consequence to the outcome of this case.  The same
    procedure would have been pursued and the same results would have been experienced.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      appellants make two basic submissions.  First, </span><span style='color:black'>they
      submit that the trial judge misapprehended and ignored important evidence,
      committing palpable and overriding error.  They say the trial judge erred
      in concluding that, had a proper consultation occurred, Dr. Robins would
      nonetheless have recommended a mid-forceps delivery, and that Mrs. Cruz
      would have followed his recommendation.  Such a conclusion is, according
      to the appellants, unreasonable and contrary to the evidence</span>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Second,
      they argue that as a result of his factual errors the trial judge reduced
      the test on causation to one of mere paternalistic assumptions devoid of
      any evidentiary foundation</span>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In
      our view the two key questions that had to be answered by the trial judge
      in this case were: (i) whether Dr. Robins would have recommended forceps
      delivery after consulting with Mrs. Cruz; and (ii) whether Mrs. Cruz would
      have followed Dr. Robins’
    recommendation if she had known all of the risk factors of both forceps delivery
    and caesarean section.</span></p>
  <h2><i>Question One</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found as a fact that Dr. Robins would have recommended vaginal
    delivery over caesarean section.  In support of this, the trial judge first
    found Dr. Robins to be a credible witness, and accepted his evidence that
    he would have tried to deliver the baby vaginally using forceps.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argue that, had he consulted with Mrs. Cruz, Dr. Robins would
    have been told by Mrs. Cruz that the baby was very large and was presenting
    in a very different way than in her previous pregnancies.  With the benefit
    of this information, according to the appellants, Dr. Robins would have likely
    recommended a caesarean section. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge found that, at the time of delivery, Dr. Robins
    knew that the baby was large and that it was in the occiput posterior position.  He
    had been Mrs. Cruz’s obstetrician for the few months preceding delivery and
    was therefore familiar with the pregnancy and Mrs. Cruz’s circumstances.  Nothing
    Mrs. Cruz would have told him would have changed his recommendation.  Dr.
    Robins’ evidence was clear.  His practice in these circumstances would have
    been to attempt vaginal delivery.  Further, the trial judge found, on the
    evidence, that a mid-forceps delivery was not an unreasonable procedure to
    use.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>There
      was sufficient evidence capable of supporting the trial judge’s findings. </span></p>
  <h2><i>Question Two</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      trial judge further found that Mrs. Cruz would have followed Dr. Robin’s
      recommendation.  </span>In reaching his decision, the trial judge relied
      on expert opinion evidence and the testimony of Mrs. Cruz. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
      Steinberg, an expert for the plaintiffs, testified that, “the patient would ‘probably’ trust
      her doctor to recommend the right thing”.  A defence expert, Dr. Owolabi,
      testified to the same effect that patients “invariably”
    follow the recom-mendation.  Mrs. Cruz testified as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        And you trusted him completely to do whatever
    was necessary to deliver the baby as safely as possible?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No, I, I trust him whatever he really
    need to do the best for my baby.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        That’s what I trust. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge misunderstood the evidence of Mrs.
    Cruz and that the evidence quoted above (that was relied on by the trial
    judge) should be read as Mrs. Cruz testifying that she would not follow Dr.
    Robins recommendation and would choose  a caesarean section where even a
    slight risk to the baby existed.  While such an interpretation may be possible,
    the trial judge understood this evidence to mean that Mrs. Cruz trusted Dr.
    Robins and would have followed his recommendations.  This is an interpretation
    that was open to the trial judge and he was in the best position to decide.  We
    note that in another part of the transcript Mrs. Cruz repeated, more clearly,
    her reliance on Dr. Robins’
    recommendations.  She said that she did not question Dr. Robins’ advice “because
    I trust Mr. Robins.  I trust the doctor.  Whatever he said, I was following
    his directions because he’s the best person to put the, the best things to
    deliver my baby.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would not give effect to this submission.  In our view the evidence is capable
    of supporting the trial judge’s findings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      appellants then argue that in making this finding the trial judge did not
      take into account the information that would have been given to Mrs. Cruz
      if consent had been sought.  The appellants urge us to conclude that, had
      she been given this information, Mrs. Cruz would not have followed Dr.
      Robins’
    recommendation.  Again, we disagree.  Given the entire situation</span>,
    including the medical disclosure she would have received at the time from
    Dr. Robins, it was not unreasonable for the trial judge to conclude that
    Mrs. Cruz would nonetheless have consented to a vaginal delivery using forceps.  Just
    because the trial judge did not accept Mrs. Cruz’s repeated assertions that
    she would have chosen a caesarean section if informed of that alternative
    does not make his finding unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to note that the appellants placed no evidence before the court
    to show that, in spite of the appellants’
    trust in Dr. Robins and their inclination to follow whatever recommendation
    he might make, the appellants would have rejected his recommendation if consulted
    on the options available and attendant risks.  Indeed, the only evidence
    on this issue was to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>It
      is clear from the trial judge’s reasons that he was aware of what Dr. Robin’s
      discussion with Mrs. Cruz should have included, and the options available
      to Mrs. Cruz.  Equally clear are his findings that, in spite of this, Dr.
      Robin’s recommendation would have been the same, and that Mrs. Cruz would
      have followed it.  In other words, that is “t</span><span style='color:black'>he
      same procedure would have been pursued and the same results would have
      been experienced”.</span> </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of both questions, the trial judge made clear findings of fact.  These
    are not subject to appellate reversal unless they amount to palpable and
    overriding error.  <span style='"Times New Roman"'>As Armstrong J.A. of this
    court recently wrote in </span><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>MacDonald
    v. Huisman</span></i><span style='"Times New Roman"'> (2007), 280 D.L.R.
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 2 </span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>at para. 56</span><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>…  The palpable and overriding error
      standard of review is an extremely high standard for any appellant to establish.&nbsp; Iacobucci
      and Major JJ. in <i>Housen</i>, at para. 5, observed that the New Oxford
      Dictionary of English (1998) described the meaning of palpable as “clear
      to the mind or plain to see”: see also <i>H.L. v.

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      evidence recited above was sufficient for the trial judge to justify his

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Finally,
      we do not agree that the trial judge erred in his conclusion on legal causation.  The
      trial judge found that, in all of the circumstances of this case, Mrs.
      Cruz would likely have proceeded with the treatment at issue even if provided
      with full information.   His decision was not unreasonable and no further
      inquiry was therefore required on his part in respect of the issue of causation</span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>.  </span></p>
