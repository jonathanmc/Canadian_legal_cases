    is a Crown appeal from the 60-day sentence imposed on the respondent on his
    third conviction for a domestic assault on his same-sex partner. The Crown
    argues that this sentence reflected an error in principle and was manifestly
    unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was the respondent’s sixth assault-related offence, his third on the same
    victim, and his tenth violence-related offence.  The sentence was imposed
    for a domestic assault committed less than 48 hours after the respondent
    was released from jail for a previous assault on the same victim.  It also
    occurred in circumstances that were in contravention of his terms of release,
    including the term that he not consume alcohol; alcohol consumption was a
    known trigger for the respondent’s violent behaviour. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining the appropriate sentence, the trial judge considered the victim’s
    wish to reconcile with the respondent, that there was no physical harm to
    the victim on this occasion, that the victim was a psychiatrist who had knowledge
    of and compassion for those with emotional difficulties and that the victim
    was not economically dependent on the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that in sentencing matters significant deference is accorded by
    this court to a trial judge’s decision.  However, in this case we agree with
    the Crown’s submission that the trial judge’s assessment of the gravity of
    the offence was erroneous.  Although he appeared to consider all the factual
    circumstances, in assessing those circumstances he did not give sufficient
    weight to the factors of specific and general deterrence and denunciation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the trial judge emphasized compassion to the respondent in circumstances
    where the ongoing pattern of violence against the victim, together with the
    respondent’s criminal antecedents and the vulnerability of the victim, required
    emphasis on other sentencing factors in order to arrive at a fit sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge focused on the fact that on this occasion that there was no physical
    harm when the respondent pinned the victim to the bed and threatened to bash
    his head in with an empty liquor bottle.  Apart from the psychological violence,
    this act was not an isolated one but part of a continuing course of violent
    behaviour against the victim.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also erred in taking into consideration that the victim was a
    psychiatrist “with a tremendous amount of knowledge and compassion for those
    who have a lot of emotional difficulties.”  In our view, the victim’s professional
    knowledge was not a factor that could be used to reduce the appropriate sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, it was not determinative that the victim was not financially dependent
    on the respondent, particularly when the victim was disabled and physically
    vulnerable, as well as emotionally dependent on the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these errors, we would allow the appeal and substitute a sentence of twelve
    months, which was the sentence initially proposed by the trial Crown at the
    time of the guilty plea.  We were not asked to interfere with the three-year
    term of probation. </p>
