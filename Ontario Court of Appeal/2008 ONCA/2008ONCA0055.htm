    victim impact statements admissible to prove the facts required to make an
    SVO designation and, if they are, does the offender have the right to cross-examine
    the victim? </p>

    appellant was convicted of three separate robberies committed over a period
    of a few weeks.  Two of the robberies involved pizza deliverymen and the
    use of an imitation weapon.
     The other involved the robbery of an iPod from a female teenager. The appellant
    pleaded guilty to one of the pizza delivery robberies and to the iPod robbery
    and was found guilty of the other robbery after a trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown gave written notice that it would be seeking three SVO designations
    pursuant to the <i>YCJA</i>, s. 42(9):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On application
    of the Attorney General after a young person is found guilty of an offence,
    and after giving both parties an opportunity to be heard, the youth justice

    offence and endorse the information or indictment accordingly.</p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the victims sustained any physical injury.  However, “serious violent
    offence” is defined by the <i>YCJA</i>, s. 2(2) to mean “an offence in the
    commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily
    harm” and, as I will explain below, “serious bodily harm” has been interpreted
    to include “any hurt or injury, whether physical or psychological, that interferes
    in a substantial way with the physical or psychological integrity, health
    or well-being of the complainant”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown relied on victim impact statements from the pizza delivery victims
    to prove that they had suffered harm that amounted to “serious bodily harm”.  Counsel
    for the appellant submitted that he was entitled cross-examine the victims
    at the SVO designation hearing.  The pizza delivery victims were not present
    and the appellant argued that use of the victim impact statements in those
    circumstances amounted to a breach of his s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth justice court judge ruled that the Crown was entitled to prove that
    the offences were SVOs using the victim impact statements and that the appellant
    was not entitled to cross-examine the victims.  The youth justice court judge
    ruled “that there indeed may be circumstances in these serious violent offence
    hearings where the failure to call the complainants to be cross-examined
    may amount to a breach of s. 7, depending on each case.”  However, he ruled
    that it was only in “the clearest of cases” that there was a <i>Charter</i> breach
    and that he was not satisfied that these were the “clearest of cases”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    pizza delivery victims were the subject of robberies involving the use of
    imitation weapons “as an item to instil intimidation and fear”.  One indicated
    in his victim impact statement that he remained terrified every time he went
    to work, and the other stated that he had problems sleeping, that he was
    afraid to go out, and that he had consulted his family doctor about his fears
    and anxiety.  The youth justice court judge found that the victim impact
    statements reflected what “any usual or reasonable person” would expect,
    namely fear, fright, and “some long term impact in terms of their feelings
    of security and safety”.  The youth justice court judge further ruled that
    the likelihood of cross-examination undermining the substance of the victim
    impact statements was “so remote” that he was unable to find a breach of
    the principles of fundament justice. </p>

    robberies but ruled that the Crown had not met its burden with respect to
    the iPod robbery. </p>

    Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the terms
    “serious violent offence” and “serious bodily harm”.  In <i>R. v. D.(C.);
    R. v. K. (C.D.) </i>(2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), Bastarache J. held
    that the <i>Criminal Code</i> definition of “serious bodily harm” applied,
    as s. 2(2) of the <i>YCJA</i> states, “Unless otherwise provided, words and
    expressions used in this Act have the same meaning as in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.”  The <i>Criminal Code</i> defines “bodily harm” at s. 2 as “any
    hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of
    the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.”  Bastarache
    J. then applied the definition given “serious bodily harm” in <i>R. v. McCraw</i> (1991),
    66 C.C.C. (3d) 517 at 524 (S.C.C.) as “any hurt or injury, whether physical
    or psychological, that interferes in a substantial way with the physical
    or psychological integrity, health or well-being of the complainant.” </p>

    SVO designation carries what the Supreme Court of Canada has described as “quite
    severe” consequences: <i>R. v. D.(C.); R. v. K. (C.D.)</i> at para. 21.  In
    a similar vein, Professor Nicholas Bala writes, “The impact of such a determination
    on the life of a youth may be profound and, consequently, the discretion
    to make such determinations should be exercised with caution”: <i>Youth Criminal
    Justice Law</i> (

    offender who is at least fourteen years old, has already committed two SVOs,
    and is being sentenced for an SVO for which an adult could be imprisoned
    for more than two years, is presumptively sentenced as an adult: ss. 62(a)
    and 2(1)(b) of the <i>YCJA</i>.
     This court has found that s. 62 infringes s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> because
    it places an onus on the youth to justify a youth sentence: <i>R. v. B.(D.)</i> (2006),
    79 O.R. (3d) 698.  Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada has been
    granted: <span class=ssl2>[</span><span class=hit>2006] S.C.C.A. No. 195</span>.

    and to describe “the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising
    from the commission of the offence”: <i>Criminal Code</i> s. 722(1).  The <i>Criminal

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    SVO designation arguably could be seen as relating to the character and nature
    of the offence rather than to the sentence to be imposed, and this characterization
    would exclude the use of victim impact statements.  The designation refers
    to the offence, not the offender, the hearing does not necessarily form part
    of the sentencing hearing, and finally, if the crime is a first or second
    SVO, the designation may not have any effect on the type or length of the
    sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, the designation is more aptly characterized as a part of
    sentencing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the operation and outcome of the provisions implicate sentencing.  The relevant
    provisions fall within “Part 4: Sentencing” of the <i>YCJA</i>. Procedurally,
    the designation is made post-conviction, and the Crown usually makes the
    request at the outset of the sentencing hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    courts for the most part seem to treat the designation as a part of sentencing.  For
    example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated simply, “This was a
    sentencing proceeding” in <i>R. v. P.(D.)</i> (2006), 212 C.C.C. (3d) 237
    at para. 35. Other courts have deemed it analogous to an aggravating factor
    in sentencing: <span class=verdana><i>R. v. T.B.W.</i>, 2003 BCPC 256 at
    para. 17<i>; R. v. K.W.W.</i>, </span><span class=ssl2>2004 BCPC 352 </span><span class=verdana>at
    para. 51.</span> In the case at bar, the youth justice court judge stated: “This
    is part of the sentencing hearing but it is a unique aspect of it that is
    unique to the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, that is to say, the hearing
    as to the designation of the offence, the type of offence and whether it
    meets the criteria for a serious violent offence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    academic commentators have concluded that the designation falls within sentencing.  Rebecca
    Jaremko Bromwich and Nicholas Bala have written, “Presumably the procedural
    and evidentiary rules that govern a sentencing hearing apply to this determination”
    and that “[i]t is submitted that the time for making such a determination
    is as a part of the sentencing stage for a particular offence”: “Serious
    Violent Offences Under the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>” in <i>The Youth
    Criminal Justice Act: A Practical Guide to the New Act. Proceedings of Continuing
    Legal Education Program Held January 18, 2003</i> (

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, accordingly, that as an SVO designation is part of the sentencing
    process, the victim impact statements were admissible pursuant to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 722(1) and the <i>YCJA</i>, s. 50(1).  </p>

      v. Gardiner</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 477 at 514 (S.C.C.), Dickson J.
      held that “facts which justify the sanction are no less important than
      the facts which justify the conviction” and that “[c]rime and punishment
      are inextricably linked”.  This means that at the sentencing stage, “the
      accused is not abruptly deprived of all procedural rights existing at trial:
      he has a right to counsel, a right to call evidence and cross-examine prosecution
      witnesses, a right to give evidence himself and to address the court.”</p>

      Code</i>, s. 724(3) codifies the <i>Gardiner</i> analysis and makes the
      following provision with respect to disputed facts on a sentencing hearing: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    the court shall request that evidence be adduced as to the existence of the
    fact unless the court is satisfied that sufficient evidence was adduced at
    the trial;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (<span class=italic1>b</span>)

    subject to paragraph (<span class=italic1>e</span>), the court must be satisfied
    on a balance of probabilities of the existence of the disputed fact before
    relying on it in determining the sentence; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (<span class=italic1>e</span>)
    the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence
    of any aggravating fact or any previous conviction by the offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    victim impact statements are not specifically mentioned, I can see no principled
    reason for excluding them from the reach of the general rule articulated
    by Dickson J. in <i>Gardiner</i> or these procedural protections listed in
    s. 724(3).  I conclude, therefore, that victim impact statements are admissible,
    pursuant to s. 722(1), but that their use is subject to the general provisions
    of s. 724(3).  The Crown bears the burden of proving any disputed fact and
    the offender has the right to cross-examine on the evidence the Crown leads.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I do not read either <i>Gardiner</i> or s. 724(3) as meaning that an offender
    has an automatic or open-ended right to insist that victims attend for cross-examination
    any time the Crown wishes to use a victim impact statement in a sentencing
    hearing. Nor do I agree that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> mandates such a right.  Conferring
    an automatic or unconstrained right to cross-examine would risk undermining
    the very purpose of victim impact statements, namely, to give victims a voice
    in the criminal justice process, to provide a way for victims to confront
    offenders with the harm they have caused, and to ensure that courts are informed
    of the full consequences of the crime.  Conferring an open-ended right to
    cross-examine might discourage victims from offering such statements and
    re-victimize those who do.  On the other hand, an absolute bar on cross-examination
    would unduly interfere with offenders’ procedural rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the way to reconcile the use of victim impact statements
    with the procedural rights conferred by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, s. 42(9)
    of the <i>YCJA</i> and s. 724(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is to impose
    a threshold
    “air of reality” burden on the offender to satisfy the sentencing judge that
    a fact or facts contained in the victim impact statement are disputable and
    that the request to cross-examine is not “specious or empty”: see Allan Manson, <i>The
    Law of Sentencing</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001) at 198.  If there is no
    factual dispute that meets this low threshold, the protections accorded by
    s. 724(3) are not triggered and I fail to see how there could be any violation
    of the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    analysis suggests that there is a discretion on the part of the sentencing
    judge to assess the offender’s request in the light of the facts that have
    been proved and the evidence that has been led, whether at the trial or on
    the sentencing hearing, with a view to achieving a just reconciliation between
    respecting the procedural rights of the offender and respecting the legitimate
    role of the victim in the sentencing process.  The sentencing judge’s duty
    to ensure that the offender’s procedural rights are protected entails a discretion
    to permit cross-examination when satisfied that there is an air of reality
    to the claim that the facts are in dispute and that the offender’s request
    to cross-examine is not specious or empty. </p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there is little jurisprudence and commentary discussing cross-examination
    on victim impact statements, the case law and commentary that does exist
    supports the conclusion that cross-examination may be allowed, but only at
    the judge’s discretion. </p>

        at the sentencing hearing “under the ‘guise’ of a victim impact statement”:
        para. 22.  The court held,
    “we find that [the sentencing judge’s] denial of a right to cross-examine
    the complainant on the new factual assertions on the guise of it simply being
    a victim impact statement was also an error at law and in principle”: para.

      Court of Queen’s Bench supported the notion that a trial judge retains
      discretion to permit or deny cross-examination.  The court suggested,
    “To permit cross-examination on a Victim Impact Statement without permission
    of the Court would fly in the face of s. 722 and would have a chilling effect
    on victims who are given the right to have their statements considered at

    a Department of Justice survey of judges suggests that cross-examination
    on victim impact statements does occur, but that judges maintain control
    over it.  Ten percent of the 110 judges surveyed had presided over a case
    in which a victim was cross-examined at sentencing on the victim impact statement.  The
    courts exercised discretion: “Judges cited the inclusion of contradictory
    facts or facts not in evidence as some of the few instances where they would
    allow cross-examination on a victim impact statement”: Policy Centre for
    Victim Issues/Department of Justice, <i>Multi-Site Survey of Victims of Crime

    Department of Justice Research and Statistics Division, 2005) at 13. </p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    neither <i>Gardiner</i> nor s. 724(3) appears to have been drawn to the attention
    of the youth justice court judge.  He was asked to deal with the issue as
    a possible breach of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  As I have already noted,
    he ruled that it was only “in the clearest of cases” that denying the right
    to cross-examine would constitute a <i>Charter</i> breach and that he was
    not satisfied that these were the “clearest of cases”.  While I do not wish
    to be taken as endorsing the view that a s. 7 <i>Charter</i> breach is only
    made out “in the clearest of cases”, I do say that the youth justice court
    judge erred by applying a more stringent test than mandated by s. 724(3),
    namely, whether there was a “dispute with respect to any fact that is relevant
    to the determination of a sentence”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the youth court judge also found that the likelihood of cross-examination
    changing or affecting the substance of the victim impact statements was “remote”.
    I agree with that assessment.  In my view, had the judge applied the “air
    of reality” test, in view of the evidence led at trial as to the manner in
    which these offences were committed, he necessarily would have come to the
    conclusion that the request to cross-examine the victims was specious or
    empty.  The appellant pointed what appeared to be handgun while masked in
    a dark location, an act obviously intended to instil intimidation and fear
    in the victim.  To make an SVO designation, the judge need not find that
    the offender <i>actually caused</i> serious bodily harm: the designation
    can also be based on a finding that the offender <i>attempted to cause</i> serious
    bodily harm.  In my view, any challenge to the allegations of trauma in the
    victim impact statements lacked an air of reality and there was no prospect
    that through cross-examination on the victim impact statements the appellant
    could have avoided a finding of harm or attempted harm sufficient to support
    an SVO finding.</p>
