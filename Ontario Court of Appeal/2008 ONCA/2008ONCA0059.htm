style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Heald appeals from the order of Macdonald J., dated June 7, 2007, striking
    his amended Statement of Claim and dismissing the action on the grounds that
    it fails to state a reasonable cause of action and that the action is an
    abuse of process.  The action is a claim for damages for solicitor’s negligence
    in the conduct of a trial.  The trial related to a prior action by Mr. Heald
    which he brought following a fire at
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Downsview
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Public School in May 1994 where Mr. Heald was employed as a teacher (the “underlying
    action”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the underlying action, Mr. Heald challenged the handling of the aftermath
    of the fire by school and education officials.  He alleged harassment, misfeasance,
    abuse of power and negligence.  After a fourteen-day trial, the underlying
    action was dismissed on a number of bases including that he had failed to
    establish the causes of action, the claims were statute-barred, the court
    lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter as the disputes were subject
    to the grievance and arbitration procedure in the governing collective agreement,
    and that he had suffered no damages.  Costs were ordered against Mr. Heald. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Heald appealed to this court.  In the course of the appeal, he introduced
    fresh evidence which included two letters from the Ministry of Labour (the
    “Letters”).  This court dismissed the appeal on the merits but reduced the
    costs award.  In the court’s endorsement, it noted that the
    “fresh evidence does not assist”.  Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
    Canada was denied. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present action, Mr. Heald alleges that his lawyer was negligent in the
    conduct of the trial of the underlying action.  The alleged negligence is
    a failure to: bring a motion at the outset of trial regarding the production
    of certain documents; call certain witnesses; challenge the evidence of certain
    parties and witnesses; cross-examine diligently enough; object sufficiently
    to the trial judge’s interventions in the trial; exclude one defence counsel
    from settlement discussion correspondence; and produce the Letters.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no basis to interfere with the order under appeal that the statement
    of claim fails to state a reasonable cause of action.  Even if the alleged
    failures had not occurred and the respondent had done everything Mr. Heald
    alleges ought to have been done, the outcome in the underlying action would
    have been no different because the underlying action would have been dismissed
    on those grounds which are unrelated to the alleged failures of the respondent.  For
    example, the determination that Mr. Heald had suffered no damages would have,
    nonetheless, been fatal to his claim in the underlying action, as would the
    finding that the claim was statute barred.  Further, the alleged failures
    and omissions of the respondent do not constitute a breach of a solicitor’s
    standard of care
    – they are, at most, errors in judgment. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the oral hearing of this appeal, Mr. Heald advanced a different argument.  In
    his response to a demand for particulars, there is a part of one sentence
    that might be construed as suggesting that had his lawyer introduced the
    Letters at a mid-trial settlement conference in the underlying action, he
    may have settled the matter.  Had that occurred, he may not have been faced
    with a costs award.  On this line of argument, he allegedly suffered damages.  However,
    it remains that the alleged omissions do not constitute a breach of the standard
    of care.  We would add that the appellant was fully aware of the Letters
    and, as they did not bear on the liability of the defendants in the underlying
    action, we do not see how the appellant might have taken any different view
    of the mid-trial settlement conference had they been presented at that time. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge said “This action is an abuse of process.”  However,
    this comment followed the motion judge’s earlier finding that, after a close
    examination of the amended statement of claim, she saw no basis for the appellant’s
    claims for damages and aggravated damages.  Read in context, we understand
    her comment to mean that it would be an abuse of process if the action were
    to proceed and the matters that had been determined in the underlying action
    were relitigated.  We take this opportunity to reiterate, however, that when
    it is alleged that a solicitor has been negligent in representing a plaintiff
    at his or her trial, it is necessary to revisit the trial for the purpose
    of determining if the result would have been different had the solicitor
    not been negligent.  Indeed, this exercise cannot be avoided.  It does not
    constitute relitigating the underlying action and, in the appropriate circumstances,
    is permissible: <i>Folland v. Reardon</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 688 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>Wernikowski v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent fixed at $1,000,
    all inclusive.   </p>
