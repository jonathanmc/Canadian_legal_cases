style='color:black;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Protectron Inc., challenges the trial judge's dismissal of its
    action and her award of punitive damages against it on several grounds. For
    the following reasons, we would set aside the punitive damages award but
    dismiss the appeal in all other respects. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept the trial judge's legal reasoning on the issues of waiver and
    the imposition of an implied term in the waiver agreement that the trial
    judge concluded had been <span style='"Times New Roman";color:black;'>entered
    into by the parties. However, for the following reasons, we agree with her
    ultimate holding that, in all the circumstances, the appellant's conduct
    precludes insistence by it on the sale to it by the respondents of the monitoring
    accounts in issue or the recovery by it of damages on account of the respondents'
    retention, for their own benefit, of the relevant accounts. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge explicitly found that during the negotiations between the parties
    concerning a possible new contract, the appellant waived its existing contractual
    right to compel the respondents to sell it the <span
style='color:black;'>monitoring accounts and to prevent the respondents' sale
    of those accounts to anyone other than the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also held that the respondents' ability to retain accounts for
    their own exclusive benefit was a significant item of discussion during the
    negotiations between the <span style='color:black;'>parties and that the
    appellant's offer that the respondents monitor their own accounts, something
    not permitted under the terms of the existing Master Contract between the
    parties, was intended as a device to drive the respondents to the bargaining
    table and to entice them to enter into a new contract. The trial judge further
    held that this strategy was “consistent with the conclusion that [the monitoring]
    accounts were to be [the respondents’] absolutely” and that this, in turn,
    was “consistent with the fact that those accounts were discussed and described
    as a possible pension fund for [the individual respondent]”. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    findings, which were open to the trial judge on the evidence, grounded her
    ultimate conclusion that the respondents were entitled to retain the 299
    accounts in issue for their own exclusive <span style='color:black;'>use.
    There is no suggestion that these findings are tainted by palpable and overriding
    error so as to justify appellate interference with them. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    we do not agree that the trial judge’s waiver and “implied term” analysis
    is legally sustainable, the trial judge also stated: “Having found waiver,
    it is not necessary for this Court to consider in detail the arguments of
    estoppel put forward by counsel for the defendants.  Needless to say, on
    the facts of this case, such arguments would have found favour with this
    Court.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, in combination, the findings we have identified support the conclusion
    that, by virtue of its negotiating strategy, the appellant is estopped from
    insisting on any entitlement to the accounts <span style='color:black;'>accumulated
    by the respondents during the contract negotiations that the respondents
    elected not to sell to the appellant in accordance with the Master Contract.  Based
    on the trial judge's findings, the appellant cannot seek to now resile from
    the consequences of this self imposed strategy. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, therefore, with the exception of the punitive damages award, we
    are not persuaded that a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the trial judge’s award of $50,000 punitive damages must be set aside.  The
    trial judge found that the appellant could not be faulted for taking a “hard
    bargaining position” or for “the colourful and abrasive negotiating style” of
    its representative, Mr. Waddell.  She based her award of $50,000 in punitive
    damages on a finding that by withholding deferred payments owing to the respondents “to
    get a reaction”, the appellant’s conduct “does…<i>approach</i> the standard
    of conduct that is
    ‘malicious, oppressive and high-handed’ as enunciated in <i>Whiten v. Pilot
    Insurance Co.</i>” [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595.  [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    set aside the award of punitive damages for the following reasons.  First,
    punitive damages are rarely awarded in commercial cases and cannot be based
    on a finding that conduct merely
    “approaches” the required standard.  Second, the trial judge made no explicit
    finding of an independent actionable wrong and we see no basis upon which
    we could make such a finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is allowed, in part, by setting aside the
    punitive damages award against the appellant. In all other respects, the
    appeal is dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the parties are unable to agree on costs, the respondents shall deliver their
    brief written costs submissions to the Registrar of this court within ten
    days from the date of these reasons. The appellant shall deliver its <span
style='color:black;'>responding costs submissions to the Registrar within ten
    days thereafter. </span></p>
