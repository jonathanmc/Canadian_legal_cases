line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the location proposed by the appellant for the
    railway line easement over the lands of the respondents did not comply with
    the terms of the Option Agreement by which the respondents granted the appellant
    the easement.  The application judge reached that conclusion on two grounds:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location was not contemplated by Schedule A to the Option Agreement,
    and </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location would have an adverse impact on the respondents’ business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no reason to interfere with the application judge’s finding that the
    appellant’s proposed location does not comport with Schedule A.  The Option
    Agreement and the judgment of Abbey J. require that the easement be located “generally
    as shown in Schedule ‘A’”.  Schedule A is a hand drawn sketch rather than
    a detailed survey that could be used to locate the easement in a precise
    fashion.  Nonetheless, it defines certain clear parameters and the application
    judge’s finding that the appellant’s proposed location fails to comply with
    those parameters is amply supported on the evidence.  In particular:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location does not go from point A a distance of 1056 ft. to point
    B, as shown on Schedule A. Instead, it cuts across the respondents’ property
    at a point significantly to the west of point B;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location cuts across two railway tracks well to the east of the
    location shown on Schedule A;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location does not go from point B to point C as shown on Schedule
    A but, rather, to a point to the east of point C in order to accommodate
    the wishes of the appellant’s tenant on the lands to the west;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    proposed location does not follow a line in close proximity to the shore
    of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Detroit
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River as shown on Schedule A. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    are significant departures from what is
    “generally as shown in Schedule ‘A’” that would materially affect the respondents’ property
    rights.  This provided a sufficient basis for the application judge to refuse
    to approve the proposed location.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with the application judge’s second ground relating to business
    interference.  We do not accept his interpretation of the Option Agreement
    as importing into the issue of the location of the easement the question
    of whether the easement interferes with or impedes the respondents’
    business operations.  Nor do we accept the respondents’ submission that the
    provision making the location of the easement subject to the approval of
    counsel gives them the right to reject a location that falls within the limits
    of what is “generally as shown in Schedule ‘A’” on the ground that an easement
    so located would interfere with their business.  In our view, the Option
    Agreement gives the appellant the right to an easement at the location “generally
    as shown in Schedule ‘A’”.  Properly read, the restriction or limitation
    in the Option Agreement pertaining to business interference relates to the
    right to use the easement once it is in place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the comments we have already made with regard to the proper interpretation
    of the Option Agreement and Schedule A, we add the following.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Option Agreement makes the location of the easement
    “subject to approval by survey, railway authorities, municipal authorities,
    relevant Governmental authorities and counsel for both parties.”  In our
    view, by recognizing the need for these approvals and by specifying that
    the location of the easement is to be <i>generally</i> as shown on Schedule
    A, the Option Agreement provided an element of flexibility sufficient to
    allow for an interpretation that reasonably accommodates changing technology
    and regulatory standards.  While this element of flexibility falls well short
    of what would be required to make the appellant’s proposed location for the
    easement acceptable, the respondents are precluded from insisting on a rigid
    or literal adherence to Schedule A that would effectively defeat the appellant’s
    right to an easement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the requirement for approval by counsel for the parties does not amount to
    a veto, and must not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there is insufficient evidence as to the past and present configuration of
    a water slip adjacent to point C to enable us to determine whether or not
    the easement must cross the water in the vicinity of point C.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents confirmed before this court that they are prepared to approve
    an easement location that conforms with Schedule A, provided that the location
    in issue does not interfere unduly with their business operations.  As is
    apparent from these reasons, the latter consideration does not afford a basis
    for the respondents to withhold their approval of a proposed easement location
    so long as that location conforms with Schedule A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the submission that it would be appropriate for this court to designate
    the exact location of the easement.  The appellant has made two proposals
    that fail to comply with Schedule A.  Justice Abbey found that the appellant’s
    original proposal was for “a completely and distinctly different location” and
    we affirm the application judge’s finding that the current proposal is significantly
    at variance with Schedule A.  We observe that the question of the location
    of this easement is one that cries out for a negotiated or mediated resolution
    and we urge the parties to explore that option.  We hope that with the guidance
    now provided by the judgments of the Superior Court and this court, the parties
    will be able to resolve the issue without further recourse to the courts.  Regrettably,
    however, the only judicial remedy we can order is to leave it open to the
    appellant to seek approval for another proposed location that does correspond
    with the terms of the Option Agreement and Schedule A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant elects to apply to fix the location of the easement, the matter
    shall be heard by Abbey J. or such other judge as the Regional Senior Judge
    designates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents fixed
    at $10,800 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
