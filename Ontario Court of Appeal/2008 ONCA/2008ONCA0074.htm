    a loose board on the back of a small garage on the property. He removed the
    board and looked inside and noticed “a black case maybe 16 inches by two

      first ground of appeal is that the charge, when initially read out in the
      oral arraignment, differed from the charge as stated in the written information,
      thereby failing to comply with s. 536(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The
      appellant argues that the oral arraignment governs and because the evidence
      establishes possession of the gun in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Michigan only, and there is no evidence that possession occurred in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville as particularized in the oral arraignment, the accused must be acquitted
    on the first count.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second ground of appeal is that the court did not have jurisdiction over
      the offences, since possession of a gun in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan does not constitute an offence in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Section 6(2) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>provides that no person shall
    be convicted of an offence outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . On this ground, the appellant maintains he should have been acquitted on
    all three counts.</span></p>

      appellant says that his conviction on the first count must be set aside
      and an acquittal entered in its place because when he was arraigned on
      this count the clerk of the court, in reading the information, neglected
      to say the words
    “and/or elsewhere”. The transcript records the clerk as arraigning the appellant
    on the following charge:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…that Conrad Rattray… on or about
      the 9<sup>th</sup> day of July 2005, at the Town of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      information itself included after the word “region” the words “and/or elsewhere” in
      relation to all three charges. The clerk simply omitted to read those three
      words in relation to count one.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that it is the reading of the information at arraignment
      that governs and because the only evidence of his whereabouts on July 9,
      2005 was that he was in the state of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan, the Crown has failed to make out the offence. No amendment, clarification

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      536(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i></span><i><span lang=EN-US> </span></i>requires
      that where an accused is charged with an indictable offence, as was the

      to his election as to mode of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, provided the trial court had jurisdiction over the offence with
    which the appellant was charged, this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Mitchell</i> (1997),
    121 C.C.C. (3d) 139, is dispositive of this ground of appeal. In <i>Mitchell</i>,
    the accused had appeared before the court a number of times before his trial
    commenced. On one of those earlier occasions the accused had, through counsel,
    indicated his desire to be tried by a provincial court judge and the information
    had been endorsed accordingly. When his case came on for trial, the trial
    judge assumed the accused had already been arraigned. The trial judge was
    wrong; the accused had not been arraigned on the earlier occasion when his
    desired method of trial was noted. The failure to read the charges to the
    accused was one of the grounds of appeal raised by Mr. Mitchell. Speaking
    for this court at paras. 25-27 of the judgment, Doherty J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>[25]     The information was not read to the appellant as required
      by s. 536(2) and nothing approaching substantial compliance with that section
      occurred. The failure to properly arraign the appellant was a procedural
      error. Section 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>provides
      that the court may dismiss an appeal where: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(iv) notwithstanding any procedural
      irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the class
      of offence of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal
      is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[26]     It has been authoritatively
      established that the failure to arraign an accused is a “procedural irregularity” which
      can be cured by s. 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) in the appropriate circumstances  [citations
      omitted]. The application of s. 686 (1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) in these cases is
      consistent with the careful analysis of the scope of that section provided
      by Goodman J.A. in <i>R. v. Cloutier</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont.
      C.A.) at 46-51, in which he held that serious procedural errors going to
      jurisdiction are within the curative reach of s. 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) as
      long as those errors do not go to the court’s jurisdiction over the type
      of offence charged. Section 686(1)<i>(b)</i>(iv) can be applied in this
      case if the failure to read the charges to the appellant did not cause
      him any prejudice.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[27]     Arraignment is intended
      to ensure that an accused is aware of the exact charges when he or she
      elects and pleads. Arraignment also ensures that all parties to the proceedings
      have a common understanding of the charges which are to be the subject-matter
      of the proceedings which follow. The appellant was told in summary form
      of the charges against him on his first appearance. More importantly, he
      made numerous appearances between his first appearance and his purported
      election on February 28, 1995; and several more before his trial started
      in August 1995. He was represented  by the same counsel throughout. Disclosure
      had been made by the Crown and in some of the appearances before August
      1995 there was reference to the substance of the charges. I have no doubt
      that the appellant and his counsel were well aware of the exact charges
      in February when counsel was asked to elect a mode of trial and in August
      when the trial actually commenced. There is no reason to think that the
      proceeding would have gone any differently had the charges been read to
      the appellant in February or August. The failure to read the charges to
      the appellant as required by s. 536(2) did not cause the appellant any
      prejudice and should not vitiate the convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mitchell</i>,
    the accused was never arraigned before his trial. In the case before this
    court the accused was properly arraigned on two of the three charges and
    on the third charge, but for the omission of the three words “and or elsewhere”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Crown’s submission that the failure to read the three words
    is of no moment on the facts of this case and accept the following submissions
    of the Crown:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear on the record that the Crown’s position was that the appellant violated
    the orders at the time he purchased the gun in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan; the information alleged that the offences were committed on July
    9, 2005 the date that the appellant acquired the gun in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    furtherance of that position, at the conclusion of the evidence the Crown
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>But the purpose of the case itself is that
    the fact that he purchased it and that the signature is his. The fact that
    he purchased it in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    is sufficient for the purposes of the Crown proving the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was also clear that defence counsel understood that the Crown was alleging
    that the offences were committed when the appellant purchased and possessed
    the gun in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Michigan. In his closing submissions counsel stated:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Now, I appreciate my friend’s position that
    once possession takes place and if possession takes place in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Michigan, if the court finds that, then that amounts to making out the charges
    before the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence took no issue at trial with the discrepancy between the information
    and the clerk’s reading at the arraignment or that the reading required the
    Crown to prove the appellant’s presence in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville on July 9, 2005 in order to convict on count one. The defence position
    at trial was that the charges were not made out because the Crown had failed
    to prove that the appellant had taken possession of the gun in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Michigan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    factors are sufficient to demonstrate that the defence was in no way misled
    by the misreading of the information. It is clear that everyone understood
    that all three offences alleged in the information arose from the same conduct:
    the possession of the gun in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Michigan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, s. 536(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> was substantially complied
    with on these facts. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>The
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario Court of Justice properly exercised jurisdiction</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal relates to whether the trial judge properly interpreted
    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Greco</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 146,
    leave to appeal to S.C.C. ref’d [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 656, to determine that
    the Ontario Court of Justice had jurisdiction to try and convict the appellant
    on the three charges. <b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on s. 6(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to this Act or any other Act of Parliament,
    no person shall be convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence
    committed outside
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court the appellant does not dispute that he had possession of a firearm
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan but says that is not a crime in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and therefore he ought to have been acquitted of all charges. The
    argument is that the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    does not reach beyond its borders. The appellant relies on the Supreme Court
    of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Cook</i> (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 1, beginning
    at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[26]     </span>The analysis is
    further conditioned by the accepted principle of international law that “since
    states are sovereign and equal, it follows that one state may not exercise
    jurisdiction in a way that interferes with the rights of other states” [citation
    omitted]. In essence, the principle of the sovereign equality of states generally
    prohibits extraterritorial application of domestic law since, in most instances,
    the exercise of jurisdiction beyond a state’s territorial limits would constitute
    an interference under international law with the exclusive territorial jurisdiction
    of another state.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    broad general statements of the law are of limited assistance. In <i>Cook</i> it
    is also noted at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, although territory is clearly a critical
    element in determining the scope of a state’s jurisdiction, territory alone
    is not determinative of jurisdictional competence under international law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to consider the substantive nature of the charges. The appellant
    was not charged with possession of a firearm, an activity which was perfectly
    lawful in the state of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Michigan. He was charged with breach of three orders of Canadian courts,
    orders made in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and orders which the Crown alleges governed his conduct worldwide. When the
    appellant came into possession of the assault rifle, he was in breach of
    specific terms of each of a court order, a probation order and a recognizance,
    all of which required that he not possess any firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concedes that since the <i>Greco</i> decision, this court has determined
    that, at least in respect of a probation order, a person may be convicted
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario of breaching a domestic court order by committing an offence beyond
    the borders of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant here seeks to distinguish the conduct on his part which gives rise
    to these offences and the nature of the conduct with which the court was
    concerned in <i>Greco</i>. He emphasizes the violent nature of the underlying
    assault in <i>Greco</i> compared to the mere possession of a rifle, a perfectly
    lawful activity in the jurisdiction where it took place. He emphasizes that
    the underlying conduct in <i>Greco</i> was also unlawful under Cuban law
    where the assault took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits in his factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, <i>Greco </i>must be read so as not to interfere
    with the right of another state to enact and apply laws in its own territory
    or to create the extra-territorial application of Canadian law. Canadian
    law cannot criminalize conduct which is perfectly legal in another state.
    That would violate international law. The way in which both the right of
    Canadian courts to enforce their orders for acts committed abroad and the
    sovereignty of states can be recognized is to distinguish between acts which
    are <i>mala in se</i> (wrong in themselves, such as murder) or prohibited
    by the law of nations or international suppression conventions (such as piracy
    or drug trafficking) and those which are <i>mala prohibita </i>(wrong because
    they are prohibited by human law). The principle of <i>malum in se</i> and <i>mala
    prohibita </i>has been recognized by this court and in the Supreme Court
    of Canada [citations omitted]….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Our courts must be cognizant of the fact that conduct
    which may be prohibited under Canadian law, and even punished by significant
    terms of imprisonment, may be quite lawful elsewhere and <i>vice versa</i>.
    It is not an answer to say that Canadian law sees a matter as a serious offence
    and thus no matter where in the world that act takes place nor how unlawful
    it may be in the host state, if a person is bound by a Canadian court order
    he or she will be subject to prosecution in Canada for that act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An assault, such as the grievous one which took
    place in <i>Greco</i>, is an act <i>malum in se</i>. The mere possession
    of a firearm is an act which may be perfectly legal or subject to varying
    degrees of regulation. It is not wrong by its very nature.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Greco</i> must be limited in its scope. To permit
    the widest application could lead to unintended results such as a person
    who is required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour being prosecuted
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for failing to follow a municipal building code or not remitting sales tax
    forms in another jurisdiction. Unless the subject of the order is committing
    a <i>malum in se</i> or similar offence, and not an act which is lawful in
    the other jurisdiction or a simple breach of a regulation in that place,
    that person should not be subject to prosecution in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument, to my mind, misses the point. The appellant is not charged with
    unlawful possession of a rifle; he is charged with breach of three court
    orders, orders made in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and ultimately enforced in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . I see no principled basis on which to distinguish the underlying conduct
    from that which gives rise to the charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Greco</i> the
    court was concerned with conduct which, if committed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , would in all likelihood have constituted an aggravated assault and clearly
    a breach of the peace. As such, that term of the probation order requiring
    Mr. Greco to keep the peace and be of good behaviour was breached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in this case, the appellant’s possession of the firearm constituted a breach
    of specific terms of the court orders that he not be in possession of a firearm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    specific terms are breached, such as is this case, the risk that people on
    probation will be charged with such things as failing to follow building
    code requirements in another jurisdiction do not arise. It is highly unlikely
    that any probation or similar order would ever contain such a specific term.
    If prosecution is sought for such conduct on the basis that an accused has
    thereby breached the peace and not been of good behaviour, it will be for
    a court to decide on the specific facts of a particular case whether the
    relevant order has been breached. In every case, the Crown will be obliged
    to prove the underlying conduct and that it constitutes a breach of the particular
    order or recognizance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Greco</i>,
    Moldaver J.A. at paras. 23 and 28-29, after reviewing the principle of territoriality
    and the rules of comity and international law, concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[23]     </span>It follows, in
    my view, that there is no basis in international or domestic law for concluding
    that a judge of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or Superior Court of Justice lacks the jurisdiction to issue a probation
    order, enforceable in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , that binds the conduct of probationers both at home and abroad.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[28]     </span>For these reasons,
    I am satisfied that the courts of this province have the authority to make
    probation orders, enforceable locally, that bind the conduct of probationers
    both at home and abroad. The only remaining question is whether to be effective  abroad,
    the probation order must contain an express provision to that effect. In
    my view, it need not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[29]     </span>I think a common
    sense inference can and should be drawn that, subject to the requirements
    of comity, probation orders are meant to apply to probationers at all times
    wherever they might be, absent a specific term to the contrary. In this respect,
    I agree with Lampkin J. that a probation order is an order made in respect
    of a particular individual and so long as it remains in force, it attaches
    to that individual wherever he or she may go.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    possession of an assault rifle may be lawful in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    it was not for this appellant in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . This weapon found its way to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and, but for the happenstance curiosity of a trespasser, would in all likelihood
    have ended up on the streets of one of our cities. The carnage that has resulted
    in our cities by the use of illegal weapons is well-known and of grave concern
    to Canadians everywhere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances here, it is only
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    that would have an interest in ensuring that these orders are complied with.
    The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    has no such comparable interest. As this court noted in <i>Greco</i> at para.
    42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Once it is understood that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is the only country that has an interest in ensuring compliance with orders
    made by Canadian courts, little more need be said in terms of the “real and
    substantial link” test.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    case was imposed upon the appellant by an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court. It required him to keep the peace and be of good behaviour
    both at home and abroad. Importantly, the offence in issue arises out of
    a breach of that order, a factor which I consider to be crucial in the application
    of the “real and substantial link” test. To the extent that he breached that
    order,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    alone has an interest in bringing him to justice and it may do so. The requirements
    of international comity do not dictate otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it matters not that the underlying conduct did not constitute an
    offence under the laws of the jurisdiction where it took place. It is not
    the underlying conduct of possessing a firearm that is the subject of prosecution,
    but rather the breach of court orders made and enforced in this country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have no hesitation in concluding that the offences of breaching court orders
    were committed in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario and that s. 6(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> has no application.</p>
