  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue in this case is whether the trial judge erred in holding that
    the appellant was not detained. That holding turned largely on the findings
    of fact by the trial judge. The appellant attacks these findings on several
    bases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits that the finding that the officer did not have reasonable
    and probable grounds to arrest was unreasonable given the information available
    to the officers including, in particular, the appellant’s record many years
    earlier for similar offences. However, at the time the officers attended
    at the business, they did not know who had use of a computer that appeared
    to be connected to the business, not a personal computer. We are not persuaded
    that it was unreasonable for the trial judge to find that objectively there
    were not reasonable and probable grounds or that it was unreasonable for
    her to accept the officer’s own evidence that he did not believe he had reasonable
    and probable grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to give appropriate weight
    to the fact the appellant was arrested after the questioning. We, however,
    agree with the trial judge’s approach to this issue. Given the incriminating
    answers, the fact that an arrest ensued, was a neutral factor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge gave undue weight to the nature
    of the questions, which she described as simple and straightforward. The
    nature of the questions, however, is a relevant factor. It was open to the
    trial judge to find that these questions were per <i>R. v. Moran</i> (1987),
    36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at p. 259: “questions of a general nature designed to obtain information”
    rather than being a case where the accused “was confronted with evidence
    pointing to his guilt”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding there was nothing
    coercive in the circumstances. As counsel aptly put it, much depends on the
    overall setting and flavour. This is a matter over which the trial judge
    had a decided advantage. The trial judge took into account the appellant’s
    own evidence that he did not feel pressured. Counsel submits that the appellant
    actually meant something different from not feeling pressured or coerced.
    However, the assessment of the appellant’s evidence was for the trial judge.
    This court cannot retry the case in this manner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have not been persuaded that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant
    was not detained. It follows that there was no <i>Charter</i> violation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application to admit the CPIC printout as fresh evidence is dismissed. This
    evidence would not have affected the result since it is merely confirmatory
    of other evidence in the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal from conviction is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge gave insufficient
    credit for the stringent bail conditions. The trial judge considered this
    matter and we cannot say that her decision to give three months credit was
    unreasonable. The sentence is not outside the range, given the serious nature
    of the crimes and the appellant’s record for similar offences. The appellant
    is to be commended for his efforts at rehabilitation, but this is a matter
    for the parole board in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
