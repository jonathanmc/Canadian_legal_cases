    and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle on October 4, 2001.  The appellant
    has a criminal record that includes five convictions for robbery.  Following

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    trial or new hearing as though that person were charged with the offence
    for the first time, except that the powers of a justice under section 515

    appeal.</p>

    jurisdiction conferred by this provision was considered by Fish J.A. <i>R.
    v. Barbeau</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (Que.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ) at 351-2</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…I
      am satisfied that the principal (if not exclusive) purpose of s. 679(7.1)
      of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is to bridge a temporal gap and not to vest
      in appellate judges an original jurisdiction normally exercised by trial
      judges who have jurisdiction over the offence charged, over the subject
      matter of the application and over the parties to it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>From
      the time a new trial is ordered until the successful appellant has appeared
      in the Court where that new trial is to be had, an application for release
      must be made, pursuant to s. 679(7.1), before a single judge of the Court
      of Appeal. No other court or judge has jurisdiction over the successful
      appellant during that interval. But once the appellant appears in the court
      before which the new trial is to be had, his or her status is that of an
      accused awaiting trial. As a matter both of statute and of principle, I
      see no reason for the appeal court nonetheless to continue to exercise
      original jurisdiction over that person's release.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      is unnecessary to decide in this case whether the jurisdiction of the Superior
      Court is exclusive (as I am inclined to believe), or concurrent. On either
      view, I would defer consideration of this application to that Court: Even
      if its jurisdiction were found to be concurrent, this is clearly a manner
      that is more appropriately dealt with by a trial court, counsel having
      advised that witnesses are likely to be called in opposition to the application,
      and perhaps in support of it as well.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Ranger </i>[2003] O.J. No. 5126 (Ont. C.A.), Feldman J.A. held that
      s.&nbsp;679(7.1) confers jurisdiction on this court to deal with judicial
      interim release in the period after the new trail is ordered but before
      the applicant appears in the Superior Court of Justice.  She agreed with
      the conclusion in <i>Barbeau</i> that, a purposive interpretation of s.
      679(7.1), based on the history of the provisions, leads to the conclusion
      that the section does not vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal
      but contemplates that once the applicant appears in the Superior Court
      of Justice court having concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the application.  As
      Feldman J.A. explained, the predecessor s. <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>679(7)
      deprived an applicant facing a new trial of the presumption of innocence
      for purposes of judicial interim release and had been declared unconstitutional:
      see <i>R. v. Sutherland</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Sask. C.A.) and <i>R.
      v. Biddle</i> (1995), 82 O.A.C. 107. Section 679(7.1) codified the practice
      of applying the test set out in ss. 515 and 522 where a person was ordered
      to be retried and, by providing that a judge of the appellate court could
      exercise ss. 515 and 522 powers, also plugged the gap in time between the
      appeal court judgment and the applicant’s appearance in the trial court.  Feldman
      J. A. further explained, at paras. 20-1:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Very
      clear language would be required in order to oust the jurisdiction of the
      trial court before which an accused appears who is charged with an offence.
      Both ss. 515 and 522 place mandatory obligations on a trial judge before
      whom an accused appears charged with an offence. Section 515 of the <i>Code</i> provides
      that, where an accused is brought before a justice, the justice is obliged
      to deal with the matter of release either by releasing the accused with
      or without conditions, or if the prosecutor shows cause, by detaining the
      person in custody. Section 522 is similarly mandatory on a judge of a Superior
      Court before whom a person appears charged with an offence under s. 469
      of the <i>Code</i>. The judge is obliged to detain the person in custody
      unless the person shows cause why his or her detention is not justified
      under s. 515(10).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view although the language of s. 679(7.1) vests jurisdiction in the
      court of appeal, it does not by its wording vest exclusive jurisdiction,
      or oust the jurisdiction of other courts that already have that jurisdiction.
      The exclusive jurisdiction in the first time period comes not from the
      presence of language of exclusivity, but as Fish J.A. stated, from the
      fact that it fills a gap where no other court had jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    behalf of the applicant, Mr. Norris submits that <i>Barbeau</i> and <i>Ranger</i> are
    both distinguishable on the ground that both cases involved charges of murder,
    an offence listed in s. 469. By virtue of s. 522, only the Superior Court
    of Justice may grant judicial interim release pending trial for an offence
    listed in s. 469.  Jurisdiction to grant judicial interim release in all
    other offences is conferred on a justice by s. 515.  As the applicant, is
    not charged with an offence that is listed in s. 469, Mr. Norris submits
    that the Superior Court of Justice has no jurisdiction to deal with this
    application and that <i>Barbeau</i> and <i>Ranger</i> have no application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to accept this submission for the following reasons.  I take the
    language of s. 679(7.1) as the starting point.  It provides that where a
    new trial is ordered, “…section 515 or 522, as the case may be, applies to
    the release or detention of that person pending the new trial or new hearing
    as though that person were charged with the offence for the first time…”<span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>  </span>As
    held in <i>Barbeau</i> and <i>Ranger</i>, s. 679(7.1) falls short of removing
    the jurisdiction conferred by s. 522 on the Superior Court.  As ss. 522 and
    515 are dealt with in identical language, it must follow that s. 679(7.1)
    does not remove the jurisdiction conferred by s. 515.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    on a literal interpretation of the relevant provisions, it seems to me that
    if a superior court judge has jurisdiction to entertain an application for
    judicial interim release pending a new trial on a s. 469 offence, a justice
    must also have jurisdiction to entertain an application for judicial interim
    release after a new trial has been ordered on all other offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    am not persuaded that the jurisdiction of a justice, so conferred, is exclusive
    or that a member of the Superior Court of Justice has no jurisdiction.  By
    virtue of the <i>Justices of the Peace Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.4, s. 5,
    every judge of the Superior Court of Justice and is “by virtue of his or
    her office a <span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>justice of
    the peace</span>”.  In <i>Re Graham and the Queen</i>, (1986) 30 C.C.C.
    (3d) 176, (S.C.O.), Osborne J. held that District Court Judge had jurisdiction
    to deal with a similar application under either the residual jurisdiction
    of a judge of the trial court “or as an <i>ex officio</i> justice of the
    peace”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the <i>ex officio</i> status of Justice of the Superior Court clothes
    him or her with the legal authority to act under ss. 679(7.1) and s. 515.  While
    there are many reasons the Superior Court would not exercise the jurisdiction
    of a justice in the ordinary case, from a pragmatic and purposive perspective,
    is every reason for the Superior Court to assume this jurisdiction in the
    context of an applicant who has appeared in that court pending a new trial
    ordered by this court.  The effect of the appeal court’s order for a new
    trial is to remit the matter directly to the trial court and the proceedings
    recommence at a point well beyond the appearance of an accused in the initial
    stages as contemplated by s.&nbsp; 515 and at a point when it is desirable
    for the trial court to maintain control over all aspects of the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note as well that members of the Superior Court of Justice are also appointed
    as ad hoc members of the Court of Appeal and therefore, if required, could
    exercise the concurrent jurisdiction conferred on this court by s. 679(7.1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, accordingly, that the Superior Court of Justice has jurisdiction
    to entertain the application.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) Should this application be transferred
    to the Superior Court of Justice?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this application should be transferred to the Superior Court of
    Justice. Some applications for judicial interim release pending a new trial
    may be readily dealt with by a judge of this court.  As Feldman J.A. noted
    in <i>Ranger</i>, it is often the case that these applications are not contentious.  Where,
    for example, the applicant has been released on bail pending the appeal,
    the Crown may not resist what amounts to an extension the bail pending a
    new trial.  In other cases, familiarity with the record may put a member
    of this court who heard the appeal in an advantageous position to deal expeditiously
    and efficiently with the application for bail pending the new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case, however, does not fall into that category.  The applicant has not been
    on bail pending his appeal and the Crown strongly resists his release pending
    the new trial. The Crown wishes to examine and cross-examine witnesses on
    the application and has demonstrated to my satisfaction a reasonable basis
    for conducting those examinations <i>viva voce</i> before the judge hearing
    the application.  <i>Viva voce</i> examinations are possible in this court,
    but they are much more readily accommodated in the Superior Court of Justice.  This
    application is likely to take at least one day to hear, at time significantly
    longer than the norm for chambers applications in this court and more readily
    accommodated in the Superior Court.  The appeal was decided on one narrow
    ground that did not require us to become fully immersed in the record of
    the long-term offender proceedings, a record that could be pertinent to the
    application for release pending the new trial.  Finally, the question of
    release is linked at least to some degree to the timing and scheduling of
    the new trial, and it is preferable for the Superior Court to have control
    over the entire matter.</p>
