  <h4>Overview </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Richard Kelly, appeals from the order dismissing his action.  He
    raised many grounds of appeal. The court required submissions from the respondent
    only in respect of issues arising out of the trial judge’s interpretation
    of s. 98(3) of the <i>Customs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, (2d Supp.), c.1.  Section
    98(1) of the <i>Customs Act</i> authorizes searches of persons entering
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    where a Customs officers “suspects on reasonable grounds” that a person is
    carrying contraband.  Section 98(3) directs that where the person to be searched
    so requests, that person must be taken before a senior officer.  The senior
    officer must discharge that person without a search if the senior officer “sees
    no reasonable grounds for the search”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge interpreted s. 98(3) as requiring that before the search could
    proceed the senior officer go further than the Customs officer, and form
    his or her own reasonable belief that the person to be searched was carrying
    contraband. On the trial judge’s interpretation, the senior officer in this
    case erred in interpreting s. 98(3) as requiring only that he review the
    decision made by the Customs officer under s. 98(1).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    reasons will focus on the interpretation of s. 98(3).  In my view, the trial
    judge misinterpreted s. 98(3) and the senior officer properly conducted a
    review of the decision made under s. 98(1) by the Customs officer.  The appellant’s
    arguments that are predicated on the senior officer’s failure to comply with
    s. 98(3) must fail.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the court did not call on the respondent to respond to the reasonable apprehension
    of bias argument, I will address that argument in these reasons.  That claim
    fails.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal the costs order made at trial.  The
    trial judge awarded costs to the respondents, who were entirely successful
    on the trial.  The trial judge, however, significantly reduced those costs
    to reflect the negligent late disclosure of material information by the respondents.  The
    costs order reflects a proper exercise of the trial judge’s discretion.  I
    need say no more about this aspect of the appeal.</p>

  <h4>The Nature of the Claim and the Significance of Section 98(3) </h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 9, 2002, Richard Kelly returned to his home in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto from a vacation in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  Mr. Kelly’s plane landed at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Pearson
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    International
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Airport.  He was questioned and eventually detained at Canada Customs.  In
    the course of the detention, Customs officials strip-searched Mr. Kelly.  He
    was also required to remain under detention until he defecated.  No drugs
    were found on or in Mr. Kelly’s person and he was released several hours
    after his arrival at the airport.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Kelly is black.  He sued the Crown (Minister of Canada Customs and Revenue
    Agency) and the individual Customs officers who were involved in his detention
    and search at the airport.  Mr. Kelly claimed that the Customs officials
    had no proper grounds to detain or search him and that they did so because
    he is a Black African-Canadian.  Paragraph 34 of the Statement of Claim captures
    the essence of Mr. Kelly’s lawsuit:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>… but for the
    fact that he [Mr. Kelly] was a Black African-Canadian, this whole procedure
    would not have occurred.  He states that he was selected due to the defendant’s
    practice of racial profiling.  In the process, he states that his rights
    under the <i>Charter</i> and at common law not to be subjected to unreasonable
    and illegal arrest and detention were violated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents defended on the basis that the Customs officials had properly
    and reasonably exercised their powers under the relevant provisions of the <i>Customs
    Act</i>, and that Mr. Kelly’s skin colour had nothing to do with any of the
    decisions made by the Customs officials.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    December 2005, after a three-week trial, Horkins J. dismissed Mr. Kelly’s
    action concluding as follows:  “When the circumstances as a whole are considered,
    there is no reasonable basis to infer that the defendants racially profiled
    Mr. Kelly.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the course of her detailed reasons, the trial judge concluded that Superintendent
    Elizabeth Warren had not fulfilled her obligations under s. 98(3) of the <i>Customs
    Act</i> when she directed that the strip-search of Mr. Kelly, ordered by
    a subordinate Customs officer, should proceed.  The trial judge interpreted
    s. 98(3) as requiring Superintendent Warren to make an independent assessment
    of whether there were reasonable grounds for the strip-search.  She held
    that Superintendent Warren had failed to exercise that independent judgment,
    but instead merely reviewed and confirmed the decision made by her subordinate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge went on to reject the submission that Superintendent Warren’s
    failure to properly perform her duties under s. 98(3) supported the inference
    that Mr. Kelly was racially profiled.  The trial judge found that Superintendent
    Warren simply misunderstood the nature of her duties under s. 98(3).    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also held that the appellant’s action was based exclusively on
    an allegation of racial profiling and did not assert a claim based on non-compliance
    with any provision of the <i>Customs Act</i>.  She said at para. 129:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A finding of
    liability cannot be based on the actions of Superintendent Warren.  While
    she had an obligation to stop the search and failed to fulfill her obligation
    under s. 98(3), this is not the basis for the claim against the defendants
    as pleaded in the statement of claim.  The allegation of racial profiling
    is the sole basis for the claim against the defendants.  The <i>Customs Act</i> is
    not even pleaded by Mr. Kelly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the trial judge released her reasons, the appellant moved to reopen the trial
    solely for the purpose of amending his pleadings to include a claim based
    on Superintendent Warren’s failure to perform her duty under s. 98(3) of
    the <i>Customs Act</i>.  The trial judge declined to reopen the case:  <i>Kelly
    v. Palazzo</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1150.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge was wrong in
    holding that the statement of claim could not be read as including allegations
    based on non-compliance with the <i>Customs Act</i>.  Alternatively, counsel
    submits that the trial judge was wrong in refusing to permit Mr. Kelly to
    reopen his case after the reasons were released for the sole purpose of amending
    his pleadings to allege a breach of the <i>Customs Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondents did not take issue with the trial judge’s interpretation
    of s. 98(3) in his factum.  He submitted, however, that she properly held
    that the claim did not encompass an allegation of a failure to comply with
    the <i>Customs Act</i> and that she properly refused to allow the appellant
    to reopen his case after the reasons were delivered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    oral argument, the court advised counsel for the appellant that it had concerns
    as to the correctness of the trial judge’s interpretation of s. 98(3) and
    requested submissions on that issue.  Counsel for the appellant defended
    the trial judge’s interpretation.  Counsel for the respondents submitted
    that the trial judge had misinterpreted s. 98(3) and that it did not require
    that Superintendent Warren make her own determination of whether there were
    reasonable grounds to search Mr. Kelly.  He argued that Superintendent Warren
    properly performed the role assigned to her under s. 98(3) by reviewing the
    decision made by her subordinate.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h4>The Allegation of a Reasonable Apprehension of Bias</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    one exception, these reasons do not comment on the grounds of appeal that
    did not require submissions from counsel for the respondents.  Before turning
    to the interpretation of s. 98(3), I will address the reasonable apprehension
    of bias argument.  There is no merit to this ground of appeal, but I do not
    think it can be left at that.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of the claim that the trial judge’s conduct demonstrates a reasonable
    apprehension of bias, counsel refers to four extracts from the evidence.  One
    extract is said to support the conclusion that the trial judge was reluctant
    to find that one of the Customs officers was lying thereby revealing a bias
    in favour of the respondents.  The other extracts consist of exchanges involving
    counsel for both parties and the trial judge.  Counsel argued that these
    exchanges demonstrate an animus by the trial judge toward counsel for the
    appellant justifying a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    same counsel unsuccessfully made virtually the same argument in another case
    in which a different trial judge rejected a racial profiling claim brought
    against certain police officers:  <i>Peart v. Peel Regional Police Services
    Board</i> (2006), 43 C.R. (6th) 175 (Ont. C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not propose to repeat the bias analysis found in <i>Peart</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 35-79.  It does bear repeating, however, that there is a strong
    presumption in this country that judges are impartial.  That presumption
    is not an artificial construct designed to shield judges from allegations
    of bias.  The presumption reflects the historical and current reality.  Judges
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    are, as a rule, strongly independent and impartial:  <i>R. v. S.(R.D.)</i> (1997),
    118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 392 (S.C.C.);  <i>Peart v. Peel Regional Police Services
    Board</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    takes much more than a demonstration of judicial impatience with counsel
    or even downright rudeness to dispel the strong presumption of impartiality.  While
    litigants may not appreciate that presumption and thus may misread judicial
    conduct, lawyers are expected to appreciate that presumption and, where necessary,
    explain it to their clients.  Baseless allegations of bias or of a reasonable
    apprehension of bias founded on a perceived slight or discourtesy that occurred
    during a trial, will not assist the client’s cause and do a disservice to
    the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s
    first contention, that the trial judge displayed a bias through her reluctance
    to find that a Customs officer was lying in her testimony, is unsupported
    by the trial record.  In the course of closing argument, counsel for the
    appellant submitted that Officer Alison Demchyshyn, the officer who determined
    that Mr. Kelly should be strip-searched,  had lied when she explained why
    she had directed Mr. Kelly to the secondary inspection area.  This submission
    led the trial judge, who of course by this time had heard all of the evidence,
    to question whether she had to find that Officer Demchyshyn was lying to
    give effect to the racial profiling claim.  A dialogue between the trial
    judge and counsel for the appellant followed.  That dialogue concluded with
    this exchange:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT:  It

    let’s assume I conclude she is not lying.  I am not comfortable drawing that

    am sure that the trial judge, having heard all of the evidence, had formed
    certain impressions about the credibility of the witnesses.  There is no
    bias in that. I am equally sure that the trial judge, like any good trial
    judge, was not anxious to brand any witness a liar without very good reason.  The
    trial judge’s comments do not suggest any bias against the appellant’s case.  The
    trial judge was trying to understand the appellant’s position and to satisfy
    herself that the racial profiling claim did not depend on a finding that
    Officer Demchyshyn was lying under oath.  As I read the exchange, not only
    was the trial judge not displaying any animus towards the appellant’s position,
    but rather she was seeking a clarification that could assist the appellant.  </p>

    trial judge’s overall assessment of the credibility of all of the witnesses
    is also relevant to this aspect of the bias allegation.  She said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Kelly and
    the defendant customs officers testified during the trial.  This was not
    a trial where the testimony of one party varied dramatically from another.  Differences
    in their testimonies did exist; however, these differences did not provide
    a basis to infer that any of the defendants practiced racial profiling.  <u>The
    differences are best described as arising from a difference in recollection
    and perspective and do not lead me to question the sincerity or credibility
    of any particular party.</u>  As a result, the evidence that I review below
    represents my conclusions of fact.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    exchanges between counsel and the trial judge which counsel for the appellant
    claims demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias, actually reflect the
    antithesis of bias.  These exchanges reveal a level of patience and professionalism
    on the trial judge’s part that accords with the high standards expected of
    trial judges.  The exchanges can only be read as indicative of  bias if one
    assumes that in any case where racial profiling is alleged, there is a presumption
    of bias against the trial judge if he or she ultimately rejects the racial
    profiling claim.  While some people may honestly and even fervently hold
    this belief, it can have no place in any legal analysis of a reasonable apprehension
    of bias claim.  </p>

    exchanges between counsel and a trial judge must also be read in the context
    of the overall trial.  They represent a few moments in a lengthy trial during
    which there were significant trial management problems.  The trial went on
    for more than three times the length anticipated by counsel.  There were
    many interruptions, for various reasons, during the examination of some of
    the witnesses.  As the trial wore on, the trial judge was understandably
    anxious to keep the trial moving towards completion in an orderly fashion.  This
    was no easy task.  </p>

    the cross-examination of respondent’s expert, Ross Fairweather, counsel for
    the respondents, objected to a question put by counsel for the appellant.  Mr.
    Fairweather was excluded from the courtroom while the trial judge heard the
    objection.  After the witness had left the courtroom, counsel for the appellant
    began to make submissions.  He indicated that there was a possibility that
    he would move to reopen his case.  The trial judge interrupted counsel and
    told him that she did not want to hear any arguments about reopening his
    case at that point in time.  She made it clear that the witness had been
    on the stand for several days and she wanted to complete his testimony.  To
    reach that end, the trial judge indicated she wanted to focus for the moment

    discussion ensued between counsel and the court as to the exact question
    that counsel wished to put to the witness.  When it appeared that counsel

    the condescending manner in which she spoke to him.  The trial judge responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Barnwell,
    I do not intend … to indicate any disrespect.  It has been a long day with

    Barnwell interrupted the trial judge to repeat that he did not like the way
    she was speaking to him.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Well, if you
    have that perception, I apologize.  It was simply not my intention.  Let’s

    assume that counsel and the trial judge made their comments honestly and
    in good faith.  By that I mean I assume that Mr. Barnwell honestly felt slighted
    by the way in which the trial judge spoke to him.  I also assume that the
    trial judge honestly did not think she was speaking to Mr. Barnwell in a
    condescending manner and offered a sincere apology for the impression she
    had apparently left with him.  I do not know what else the trial judge could
    have done to dispel Mr. Barnwell’s concern that he was not being treated
    with adequate respect by the trial judge.  This exchange, like the others
    to which our attention was drawn, shows a trial judge doing her level best
    to keep the trial moving, while at the same time responding fairly and in
    a professional manner to specific concerns raised by counsel.  Nothing in
    this exchange comes close to suggesting, much less demonstrating, a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.</p>

    and she did not at that point believe that she had grounds to order a search
    under s. 98(1) of the <i>Customs Act</i>.  Officer Demchyshyn decided that
    Mr. Kelly should be sent to secondary inspection because he seemed nervous

    minutes.  She also searched his luggage, examined the contents of his wallet,

    with Officer Demchyshyn about her reasons for ordering the search and reviewed

    the grounds relied on by Officer Demchyshyn and anything that Mr. Kelly might

    probable grounds standard:  <i>Simmons</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 320-21;  <i>Monney</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 34-37.  These more intrusive searches are conducted under the authority
    of s. 98 of the <i>Customs Act</i>, the statutory provision invoked by Officer
    Demchyshyn.</p>
  <h2>(c) Section 98(1)</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    98(1) of the <i>Customs Act</i> authorizes searches of the person by Customs
    officials.  It reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>An officer may
    search,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any person who
    has arrived in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>if the officer
      suspects on reasonable grounds</u> that the person has secreted on or about
      his person anything in respect of which this Act has been or might be contravened,
      anything that would afford evidence with respect to a contravention of
      this Act or any goods the importation or exportation of which is prohibited,
      controlled or regulated under this or any other act of Parliament.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    the interpretation of the standard provided in s. 98(1), nor the scope of
    the search authorized by that provision are in dispute on this appeal.  An
    officer may order a search on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that the
    individual has contraband such as illicit drugs on or in his person.  The
    reasonable suspicion standard is akin to the standard required for an investigative
    detention.  It combines a subjectively based suspicion with the objective
    requirement that the suspicion be reasonable in all of the circumstances:  see  <i>R.
    v. Mann</i> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 at 320-23 (S.C.C.).  Insofar as the
    scope of the search is concerned, it is recognized that a s. 98(1) search
    may include both a strip-search and a “loo search”:  see <i>R. v. Monney</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge applied the reasonable suspicion standard when assessing Officer
    Demchyshyn’s decision to order the strip-search and the “loo search”.  On
    the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that Officer Demchyshyn
    had reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr. Kelly had drugs on or in his person
    when she ordered him searched pursuant to s. 98(1).</p>
  <h2>(d)  Section 98(3)</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    98 contains a further safeguard against improper searches.  The person to
    be searched may ask to be taken before the “senior officer”.  Mr. Kelly made
    that request.  Section 98(3) describes the function of the “senior officer”:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A senior officer
    before whom a person is taken pursuant to subsection (2) <u>shall, if he
    sees no reasonable grounds for the search, discharge the person or, if he
    believes otherwise, direct that the person be searched</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her analysis, the trial judge emphasized the difference in the language used
    in s. 98(3) “reasonable grounds for the search”
    and the language used in s. 98(1) “suspects on reasonable grounds”.  The
    trial judge saw the different language as reflecting Parliament’s intention
    to impose a more stringent standard in s. 98(3) than in s. 98(1).  She said
    at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A passenger can
    ask for a senior officer to review the grounds for the pending search before
    it starts.  <u>A review by a senior officer is governed by s. 98(3), which
    imposes a more stringent test than s. 98(1)(a).  The senior officer must “believe” there
    are reasonable grounds for the search.</u>  Without this belief, the search
    cannot go ahead.  …  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    returned to the comparison of s. 98(1) and s. 98(3) later in her reasons
    at para. 115:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The language
    in s. 98(3) is different from s. 98(1).  While <u>Officer Demchyshyn only
    needed to suspect on reasonable grounds that Mr. Kelly had drugs on or in
    his body, Senior Officer Warren could only direct the search to proceed if
    she believed there were reasonable grounds for the search.  A threshold requiring
    a belief is higher than the suspicion required in s. 98(1).</u>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence and concluded that Superintendent Warren
    did not have reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Kelly had drugs on or in his
    person.  She said at para. 127:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Considering Superintendent
    Warren’s testimony at its highest, it is not possible to conclude that she
    fulfilled her duty as set out in 98(3) of the <i>Customs Act</i>.  Since
    she did not believe that Mr. Kelly was a drug ingestor or a drug carrier,
    she had no basis for allowing the search to continue.  Her evidence is clear
    and not capable of any other interpretation, particularly since she stated
    twice she did not have the requisite belief.</p>

    be applied by the senior officer under that section.  </p>

    provides some assistance.  That case considered the constitutionality of
    ss. 143 and 144 of the <i>Customs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-40, the predecessor
    sections to ss. 98(1) and 98(3).  Section 143 authorized the search of a
    person if the officer had “reasonable cause to suppose” that the person had
    contraband
    “about his person”.  Section 144(1) provided that the person to be searched
    pursuant to s. 143 could require the officer to take him before a police
    magistrate, a justice of the peace or the chief officer of the airport.  The
    person before whom the individual to be searched  was taken was required
    to order the person discharged without being searched if “he sees no reasonable
    cause for a search”.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “reasonable
    cause to suppose” standard in s. 143 is the same as the “reasonable grounds
    to suspect” standard set out in s. 98(1):  <i>Monney</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 37.  While s. 98(3) limits the person before whom the individual to
    be searched can be taken to the senior officer, it otherwise describes the
    same process as is described in s. 144 of the predecessor Act.  Under both
    s. 98(3) and s. 144, the person before whom the individual is taken must “see” if
    there is reasonable cause to proceed with the search ordered by the Customs
    officer.    </p>

    Chief Justice Dickson considered the constitutionality of ss. 143 and 144
    together.  He noted that the standard applied to justify a personal search
    under ss. 143 and 144 fell short of the reasonable and probable grounds standard,
    observing at p. 317:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Sections 143
    and 144 do not mandate prior authorization of personal searches by a person
    acting in a judicial capacity.  <u>The standard upon which a search may be
    conducted under the provisions, reasonable cause to suppose</u>, also falls
    short of the reasonable and probable grounds established on oath required
    by <i>Hunter</i> [<i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145].  [Emphasis

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Chief Justice describes a single standard applicable to the searches referred
    to in both ss. 143 and 144.  That standard is the one found in s. 143, the
    predecessor to s. 98(1) and permits a search based on reasonable suspicion.  It
    was not argued in <i>Simmons</i> that the senior officer was required to
    apply a more stringent test than the officer who initially ordered the search.  However,
    it seems to me that if the court saw any potential difference in the standards
    imposed on the two officials, this difference would have by necessity found
    its way into the court’s analysis in a case where the constitutionality of
    both provisions was directly in issue.</p>

    assistance as to the meaning of s. 98(3) can be gleaned from the description
    in <i>Simmons</i> of the process contemplated by ss. 143 and 144.  Dickson
    C.J.C. observed at p. 320:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under the <i>Customs
      Act</i>, searches of the persons are not routine but are performed only
      after customs officers have formed reasonable grounds for supposing that

      to search is subject to review at the request of the person to be searched.</u>  [Emphasis

    98(3) is described by Chief Justice Dickson as “a review” of the initial
    decision to search made by the Customs officer.  This “review” must be performed
    by a “senior officer”, who has supervisory authority over the person who
    made the initial decision.  I think a “review”
    connotes a process wherein senior supervisory personnel assess the fitness
    of decisions made by subordinate Customs officers.  A
    “review” does not suggest to me a <i>de novo</i> investigation by the senior
    officer aimed at a determination by the senior officer as to whether he or
    she reasonably believes that the person to be searched is carrying drugs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    98(3), unlike s. 98(1), does not speak in terms of the senior officer having
    his or her own reasonable suspicion, much less reasonable belief, that the
    person to be searched has contraband on or about his person.  Instead, s.
    98(3) directs that the senior officer determine whether he or she “sees no
    reasonable grounds for the search”.  In my view, there are no reasonable
    grounds for the search if the Customs officer who directed the search could
    not reasonably have formed the requisite suspicion or if based on additional
    information brought to the attention of the senior officer, there no longer
    exists any reasonable basis for that suspicion.  The language of s. 98(3)
    directs the senior officer’s inquiry to the reasonableness of the initial
    decision to search as informed by any additional information made known to
    the senior officer.  The language of s. 98(3) is, in my view, inconsistent
    with the senior officer conducting his or her own investigation to determine
    whether he or she personally believes, or suspects that the person to be
    searched is carrying contraband.  </p>

    144 of the <i>Customs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C.40 provides some further
    insight as to the proper role of the senior officer when asked to review
    a decision made by a Customs officer to order a search under s. 98(1).  As
    indicated above, s. 144 is the predecessor to s. 98(3) and is essentially
    the same as the present section, except that it provided that the person
    to be searched could be taken before a magistrate or a justice of the peace
    as well as the chief officer at the port or place.  Under the present section,
    the person cannot be taken before a magistrate or a justice of the peace.  The
    judicial status of some of the persons before whom the individual could be
    taken under s. 144 is much more consistent with a process whereby those individuals
    review the initial decision of the Customs officer to ensure compliance with
    s. 98(1) than it is with those judicial officers conducting their own investigation
    and forming their own suspicions or beliefs about whether the individual
    is carrying contraband.  </p>

    would hold that s. 98(3) contemplates a review of the decision made under
    s. 98(1).  It flows from that characterization that the section does not
    provide a different and more stringent standard than the standard contemplated
    under s. 98(1).  It would make no sense to review the decision to search
    made under s. 98(1) using a more stringent standard than the standard contemplated
    by s. 98(1).</p>

    summary, s. 98(3) requires that the senior officer review the Customs officer’s
    decision to order a search under s. 98(1) in the light of the information
    available to the Customs officer as well as any new and relevant information
    that may be made available to the senior officer.  If the senior officer
    is satisfied that there was a reasonable basis for the decision made under
    s. 98(1) and that the basis for the reasonable suspicion remains intact,
    the search may proceed.  The senior officer’s review must be based on the
    information relied on by the Customs officer in making the initial decision
    considered in the light of any additional information provided to the senior
    officer by the person to be searched or from some other source.</p>

    Warren fulfilled her statutory duty under s. 98(3).  She reviewed with Officer
    Demchyshyn the grounds upon which Officer Demchyshyn relied in ordering Mr.
    Kelly strip-searched pursuant to s. 98(1).  She assessed the reasonableness
    of the indicators relied on by Officer Demchyshyn.    </p>

    made sure that Mr. Kelly understood the situation he faced, and gave him
    a fair opportunity to answer the questions he had refused to answer in his

    her to reject the reasonableness of the grounds upon which Officer Demchyshyn

    paucity of the evidence reflects the fact that compliance with s. 98(3) was
    far from the core of the dispute in this case.  I would, however, make these
    brief comments concerning the procedure to be followed under s. 98(3).</p>

    98(3) is an important and final protection afforded to the individual against
    what may be a very invasive search carried out under s. 98(1).  The section
    can only serve its purpose if the individual to be searched is given a meaningful
    opportunity to satisfy the senior officer that he or she should not be searched.  That
    opportunity is meaningful only if the person to be searched understands the
    nature of the search to which he or she will be subjected and appreciates
    the role of the senior officer in the process.  In addition, the person to
    be searched must understand, at least in general terms, the grounds for the
    search and must be given an opportunity to respond to those grounds.  The
    senior officer should make sure that the person to be searched has the requisite
    understanding of the process, the senior officer’s role in that process,
