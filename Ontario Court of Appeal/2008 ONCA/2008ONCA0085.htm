style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting
    into evidence a very large quantity (77 pounds) of cocaine seized from a
    car being driven by the appellant, in light of what the trial judge described
    as extremely serious breaches of the appellant’s ss. 8 and 9 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the police officer involved did not have reasonable
    grounds to stop and search the car and that he knew it.  He described the
    officer’s actions as flagrant.  The trial judge did not accept the officer’s
    evidence attempting to explain his actions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    deciding to admit the evidence, the trial judge considered the appropriate
    factors under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  He decided that the seriousness
    of the breaches was not sufficient to warrant exclusion.  He put it this
    way: “[the <i>Charter</i> breaches] pale in comparison to the criminality
    involved in the possession for the purpose of distribution of 77 pounds of
    cocaine …”.  In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge was very alive
    to the conduct of the police officer that gave rise to the breaches and to
    the problems with the police officer’s testimony at trial.  In the end, however,
    this experienced trial judge concluded that the harm to the reputation of
    the administration of justice from excluding the evidence would be greater
    than that from admitting it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge recognized that the breaches did not fall in the most egregious
    category.  While the trial judge did not elaborate to any great extent, there
    are circumstances which attenuate the seriousness of the breaches which support
    his conclusion.  For example, the officer’s conduct was not shown to be<b> </b>systemic
    in nature, or the result of operational policies or guidelines, or even an
    order from a senior officer.  The actions involved were those of one officer,
    who had been on the force for four years and who made some flawed decisions
    during the roadside encounter and later when testifying.  And while some
    might describe the officer’s breaches as “deliberate” (the trial judge did
    not use that word), that description tends to paint a picture of a more planned
    and premeditated course of action than the record reveals.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the <i>Charter</i> breaches did not have a particularly serious
    effect on the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  The appellant was detained
    in the roadside stop for only a short period of time.  As the trial judge
    pointed out, the officer did not use any force or physical restraint.  The
    officer did not search the appellant’s person, he only searched the car.  The
    appellant did not own the car.  It had been rented by the passenger.  The
    appellant’s privacy interest in the car was low.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s decision to admit the evidence was open to him.  It
    was not unreasonable and reflects no error in principle.  His decision deserves
    deference in this court.  We do not suggest that this is an easy case –
    far from it.  This is a close call and one on which reasonable people could
    disagree.  But, in our view, that makes it precisely the type of case in
    which deference comes into play.</p>

    appellant, Bradley Harrison, was tried before Justice Karam in the Superior
    Court of Justice on a charge of trafficking in cocaine.  The cocaine was
    found in the rear area of a rental vehicle which the appellant was driving
    even though his driver’s licence was suspended.  The seized cocaine weighed
    35 kilograms (77 lbs.) and had a street value of between $2,463,000 and $4,575,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the commencement of the six-day trial, the appellant and his co-accused,
    Sean Friesen, brought an application to exclude the evidence relating to
    the seizure of the cocaine.  Following a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge
    held that the police had violated the appellant’s (and Mr. Friesen’s) rights
    under ss. 8 and 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, after engaging in the
    analysis mandated by <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.),
    the trial judge admitted the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial continued. Mr. Friesen was acquitted in mid-trial following a successful
    motion for a directed verdict on the basis that the vehicle rental agreement
    in his name was hearsay and, accordingly, the Crown could not prove possession.  The
    appellant called a defence and testified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment.  The
    appellant appeals his conviction, but not his sentence.  His principal ground
    of appeal is that the trial judge erred in his <i>Charter</i> s. 24(2) ruling.  He
    also alleges errors in two other determinations by the trial judge: his conclusion
    that he was in possession of the cocaine and his application of the doctrine
    of reasonable doubt,  through the test set down in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).</p>

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Durango.  He then noticed that the

    Durango had an

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Alberta it was not an offence to drive a vehicle without a front licence
    plate.  Nevertheless, he decided to stop the vehicle.  His reasons for doing
    so were captured in this exchange with the trial judge during the <i>voir
    dire</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT: I
    just have one question, and that is, when you determined that the vehicle,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>He had searched
    around the front of the vehicle.  Um, he then, ah, got out of the vehicle
    and checked his pants pocket for a wallet, and then he checked the second
    back seat.  It was an S.U.V., so the second set of passenger seats.  He went
    through his, ah, his clothes quickly, and closed the door; and then he told
    me that he must’ve left it in his friend’s bag in

    the appellant was looking for his driver’s licence, Bertoncello noticed that
    the SUV was messy and littered with used food and drink containers, giving
    it what he termed a “lived-in look”.  This suggested to him that the occupants
    of the SUV had been travelling virtually “non-stop”, with only quick breaks
    to obtain food.</p>

    further questioning, the appellant told Bertoncello his address and his date
    of birth, and indicated that he had met Friesen a few months earlier, through
    a mutual friend.  During this exchange, Bertoncello noticed clothing and
    bags on the back seat of the SUV and a silhouette of two boxes and bags in
    the rear compartment.</p>

    Bertoncello went to his vehicle, conducted CPIC and PARIS checks and discovered
    that the appellant’s driver’s licence had been suspended.  Indeed, the appellant
    had been served with formal notice of the suspension by an O.P.P. officer
    only eight days earlier, on October 16, 2004.</p>

    Bertoncello arrested the appellant for driving while his licence was suspended.  He
    decided to search the vehicle as an incident to the arrest because the appellant
    hadn’t “identified himself properly in the search for a driver’s licence,
    which I believe could be contained within the motor vehicle.”  Constable
    Bertoncello told the appellant that he was going to search for the missing
    licence.</p>

    Bertoncello asked the appellant if there were drugs or weapons inside the

    reasons for asking this question in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q. Was there
    a reason why you asked that question?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A. Ah, just
    for personal safety reasons.  Um, just like prior to, ah, arresting an individual
    on the street, I’ll ask if they have any drugs or weapons on them for my
    own safety.  I don’t want to be, ah, pricked by a needle, or, um, pull a
    trigger on a handgun or anything like that, that I don’t know is around.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>                                    …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q. All right.  Were
    there other factors that you thought of, apart from safety reasons, to mention
    to Mr. Harrison that there were drugs or weapons inside the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A. Well, I know
    from my, ah, training experience, um, including and being inside the Highway
    Drug Interdiction Course, that, um, Vancouver, being a port city is a city
    where plenty of drugs are imported into Canada.  I also know that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto is a destination city where the drugs can be distributed from.  Ah,
    there was a short trip; the rental vehicle was from, ah, Thursday; um, the

    Bertoncello asked Friesen if there were drugs or weapons in the vehicle and

    which were taped shut.  He told Friesen that the boxes seemed solid and he
    could not hear anything that sounded like dishes.  He then asked Friesen
    again if there were weapons or drugs:</p>

    24(2) was written to constitute an intermediate position between the automatic
    exclusionary rule familiar to American Bill of Rights jurisprudence and the
    automatic inclusionary rule of the common law for non-conscriptive real evidence:
    see <i>Collins</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 16.  The Supreme Court of Canada has
    consistently rejected analyses of s. 24(2) that would lead to either extreme:
    see <i>R. v. Buhay</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 71 (S.C.C.).  Justice
    Iacobucci described s. 24(2)’s middle-ground approach as follows at para.
    57 of <i>R. v. Mann</i> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Just as there
    is no automatic exclusionary rule, there can be no automatic inclusion of
    evidence either.  The focus of the inquiry under this head of analysis is
    to balance the interests of truth with the integrity of the legal system.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main purpose of s. 24(2) is to protect the reputation of the administration
    of justice.  In the words of Lamer J. in <i>Collins</i> at p. 16, “s. 24(2)
    is not a remedy for police misconduct.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    the application of s. 24(2) focuses on the reputation of the administration
    of justice, the views of the community at large are relevant.  That is not
    to say that courts should always rely on the actual views of the community.  Such
    a populist approach would risk subjecting the <i>Charter</i> to the volatile
    ebb and flow of majority sentiment and would thus arguably run counter to
    the very idea of constitutionally entrenched rights.  That said, the question
    of disrepute is not to be analyzed solely from the perspective of judges
    or the legal community.  The standard is that of the reasonable person, and
    according to Lamer J. in <i>Collins</i> at p. 18, “[t]he reasonable person
    is usually the average person in the community, but only when that community’s
    current mood is reasonable.”  The reasonable person standard, wrote Lamer
    J. at p. 18 of <i>Collins</i> “serves as a reminder to each individual judge
    that his discretion is grounded in community values.”</p>

    24(2) directs judges to consider “all the circumstances” in determining whether
    a Charter violation mandates exclusion.  The court in <i>Collins</i> chose
    to divide the factors involved in this inquiry into three categories: those
    relating to the effects of the breach on trial fairness, those relating to
    the seriousness of the constitutional breach, and those relating to the effect
    of excluding the evidence on the reputation of the administration of justice.  Ultimately,
    however, the question is whether admitting the evidence would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute: see <i>Buhay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 72. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent
    a clear legal error in applying the test for exclusion, a trial judge’s decision
    to exclude or admit evidence under s. 24(2) is subject to considerable deference:
    see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R. v. Duguay</i> (1989), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 5 (S.C.C.); <i>R.
    v. Mellenthin</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 488 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Silveira</i> (1995),
    97 C.C.C. (3d) 450 at 500 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C.
    (3d) 321 at 349 (S.C.C.); <i>Buhay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 44; <i>Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 59; <i>R. v. Chaisson</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 7 (S.C.C.).  There
    are good reasons for deferring to a trial judge’s determination.  As expressed
    by Arbour J. in <i>Buhay</i> at para. 70, trial judges “have a much better
    understanding than we do about the likely effects of their decisions on their
    communities and on those who enforce the law in those communities.”  Trial
    judges are in this preferred position because they have more direct contact
    with the public and with the people involved in the criminal justice process
    than appellate judges.  On a regular basis, trial judges sitting in criminal
    courts hear from victims, accused persons, witnesses, police officers, defence
    counsel and frontline prosecutors.  They have an opportunity to observe firsthand
    the way the criminal justice system is functioning and are well positioned
    to make assessments about the broad range of issues on which appellate courts
    are required to show deference.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, trial judges handle s. 24(2) issues on a frequent basis and, thus,
    are accustomed to the complex process of balancing that this section of the <i>Charter</i> mandates.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s decision on s. 24(2), therefore, should not be interfered with
    unless it constitutes an error of law or is unreasonable: see <i>Silveira</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 497 and <i>Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 59.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal deals primarily with the second and third prongs of the <i>Collins</i> framework.  It
    is noteworthy that courts tend to defer more to trial judges in their assessment
    of those prongs than in their assessment of the trial fairness prong of <i>Collins</i>.  According
    to Prof. Kent Roach in <i>Constitutional Remedies in Canada</i> (Aurora:
    Canada Law Book, 1994) at para. 10.625:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In practice,
    a trial judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the violation and the balance
    between the harms of admitting or excluding the evidence will often be accorded
    much deference because they are driven by the trial judge’s perception of
    the facts.  In contrast, the issue of whether the fair trial test is engaged
    because the evidence has been unconstitutionally conscripted from the accused
    will often be driven by the trial judge’s analysis of the complex law surrounding
    the fair trial test.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge in this case understood the <i>Collins</i> factors and applied
    them in a relatively comprehensive fashion.<i></i></p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>            </span><span style='font-style:normal'>(a) <u>Trial
        fairness</u></span></h3>

    parties conceded, and the trial judge found, that the admission of the impugned
    evidence would not affect trial fairness.  It is important, however, not
    to skate by this factor too quickly.  The trial fairness prong is not merely
    a mechanical step or a box to be ticked.  In the <i>Collins</i> analysis
    of s. 24(2), trial fairness “is undoubtedly the most important issue and
    should be given the greatest weight”: see <i>Mellenthin</i>,<i> supra,</i> at
    489.  Accordingly, where trial fairness would be negatively affected by the
    admission of the evidence, this in itself can be sufficient grounds for exclusion,
    without considering the second and third factors: see <i>Stillman</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 350.  That, however, is not the case here.  It is accepted that the appellant’s
    trial was fair even with the admission of the cocaine seized from the car
    he was driving.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b) <u>Seriousness of the breach</u></span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that Constable Bertoncello violated the appellant’s (and
    Friesen’s) rights under both s. 8 and s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He found
    that the officer’s explanation for stopping the vehicle and detaining its
    occupants was “contrived and def[ied] credibility.”  Accordingly, the detention
    was arbitrary.  The trial judge also found that the search of the vehicle
    after the appellant’s arrest was not
    “truly incidental” to the arrest for driving while under suspension and that
    “the officer’s avowed purpose for the search was certainly not reasonable.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    he came to the second branch of the <i>Collins</i> s. 24(2) analysis, the
    trial judge used very strong language in his criticism of the police officer.  He
    described the officer’s conduct as “brazen and flagrant”, stated that “the
    search was not conducted in good faith”, and ultimately characterized the
    two <i>Charter</i> breaches as “extremely serious”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    accept the trial judge’s findings of fact with respect to the officer’s conduct
    when he stopped and searched the vehicle as well as his findings with respect
    to the officer’s reasons for his actions.  The trial judge heard the evidence
    and was in the best position to assess the officer’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also found, however, that this case did not fall within the most
    egregious category of <i>Charter</i> breaches.  Although his discussion on
    this point was brief, there was sufficient evidence to support his conclusion.  A
    fair reading of the officer’s evidence does not reveal that he had a carefully
    thought out plan or practice to<b> </b>breach the <i>Charter</i>.  The officer
    suspected that there were drugs in the car.  His on-the-scene decision to
    follow his suspicions without reasonable grounds was a serious mistake.  By
    the time he searched the car, however, it is arguable he had enough information
    to warrant a search, though on cross-examination, he agreed that he did not
    have enough information to obtain a warrant.  While some might describe the
    officer’s breaches of the <i>Charter</i> as
    “deliberate” (the trial judge did not use that word), that description, in
    our view, tends to paint a picture of a more planned and premeditated course
    of action than the flawed decision-making process the record reveals.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover<b>,</b> from
    the appellant’s point of view, the effects of the breaches were not particularly
    serious.  His detention at the side of the road was brief: only fifteen minutes
    elapsed between the beginning of the traffic stop and the appellant’s arrest
    for driving with a suspended licence.  As the trial judge pointed out<b>,</b> during
    the period of the improper detention, the appellant was not subjected to
    any physical force or restraint. </p>

    more importantly, the effect of the search on the appellant’s privacy interest
    was not great.  This is not a case involving a search of a person, a residence
    or an office.  The search was of a car, nothing more.  </p>

    ).  In this case, the vehicle was a rental vehicle.  The appellant was not
    the lessee.  He was properly arrested for driving while under suspension.  Moreover,
    the appellant did not testify in the <i>voir dire</i> about any perceived
    violation of his privacy interest.  He did not even look to make sure his
    own bags were in the vehicle’s rear compartment prior to leaving

    to Friesen.  This denial of ownership is an important factor.  Recently,
    in a similar case in which an officer searched a bag after a young man denied
    the bag was his, <i>R. v. L.B.</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 730 (C.A.), Moldaver
    J.A. observed at para. 71:
    “Having disclaimed any privacy interest in the bag, the respondent effectively
    precluded himself from relying on s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> to impugn the
    lawfulness of Officer Purches’s search.”  </p>

    we conclude that <i>the effects</i> of the breaches on the appellant’s rights

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This brings us
    to the third question to be determined under the <i>Collins</i> test, and
    that is whether excluding the evidence would have a more serious impact on
    the administration of justice than admitting it.  This factor relates to
    the seriousness of the offence and the importance of the evidence to the
    case for the Crown.  In the case at bar, the Crown, it would appear, has
    no case without the drugs.  More significantly, in view of the vast quantity
    of cocaine in question, these charges are extremely serious.  It is important
    to consider the degree of criminality involved in the possession for the
    purposes of distribution of 77 pounds of cocaine and the societal damage
    resulting from that amount of such a dangerous drug.</p>

    the direction of admitting the evidence.  The crime was very serious and

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>To exclude
    the evidence under these circumstances, where the guilt of the respondent

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I adopt that
    statement and find that it applies to the facts of this case.  Accordingly,
    after carefully balancing the seriousness of the breaches against the effect
    of exclusion, I am satisfied that the evidence should not be excluded.  As
    blatant as the arresting officer’s behaviour was in conducting the detention
    and search and as brazen as his explanation for his actions in this court,
    they pale in comparison to the criminality involved in the possession for
    the purposes of distribution of 77 pounds of cocaine, if such is proven. </p>

    do not accept the appellant’s argument that the trial judge failed to perform
    the balancing that <i>Collins</i> mandates.  In his reasons the trial judge
    explicitly mentioned balancing the effects of exclusion against the seriousness
    of the breach.  While his juxtaposition of “the arresting officer’s behaviour” with “the
    criminality involved” may be a slight mischaracterization of the <i>Collins</i> test,
    which requires a balancing among the effects on trial fairness, the seriousness
    of the breach, and the effects of excluding the evidence on the administration
    of justice, it is not an error of law.  Even if such a mischaracterization
    were, in itself, an error of law, that error would be mitigated by the statement
    that the trial judge adopted from <i>Puskas</i>, which properly refers to
    the need to compare the effect on the administration of justice of admitting
    versus excluding the evidence.<i></i></p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge’s second error in his consideration
    of the third branch of <i>Collins</i> was his misapplication of <i>Puskas</i>.  He
    contends that the facts and findings in <i>Puskas</i>  were clearly distinguishable
    from the findings in the present case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    facts of <i>Puskas</i>, where the police after being issued a warrant seized
    marijuana plants from a backyard, may indeed be distinguishable in certain
    respects from those in this case.  However, the trial judge, in quoting from <i>Puskas</i>,
    was not asserting an exact factual analogy, but rather a similar outcome.  He
    was merely saying that in both cases the exclusion of the evidence would
    cause the administration of justice to fall into greater disrepute than its
    inclusion.  In our view, this does not constitute a legal error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    we do not accept the appellant’s argument that to admit the evidence in this
    case would amount to judicial condonation of police misconduct.  The very
    nature of s. 24(2) contemplates that judges will admit evidence in some cases
    where there has been a breach of the <i>Charter</i>, but the exclusion of
    evidence would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute
    than its admission.  A trial judge who so admits evidence should not be viewed
    as condoning <i>Charter </i>breaches but rather protecting the administration
    of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the trial judge underlined the seriousness of the police officer’s
    breaches of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  He described them in
    detail and, ultimately, characterized them as “blatant and flagrant.”  His
    ruling was far removed from being a judicial condonation of the police misconduct;
    indeed, it was, explicitly, the opposite – a clear condemnation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    considering whether admitting the evidence would bring the system into disrepute,
    it is important to bear in mind that the police misconduct was not shown
    to be systemic in nature or the result of an operational policy or guidelines
    or even an order from a senior officer.  While clearly the misconduct was
    serious, the actions involved were those of one police officer, who had been
    on the force for four years.  That officer made some flawed decisions during
    the roadside encounter and later when testifying.  However, this is not a
    case where it has been shown that there is or even might be an institutional
    problem.  Furthermore, <i>Collins</i> states at p. 16 that s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> is
    not intended as a remedy for police misconduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the trial judge recognized, police conduct is but one factor in the s. 24(2)
    analysis.  The wording of s. 24(2) and all of the leading cases over 20 years
    compel trial judges to engage in an analysis of many factors under the <i>Collins</i> analytical
    framework.  There is rarely an automatic equation between police misconduct
    and exclusion of the evidence.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    way of illustration, had the police officer in this case engaged in more
    egregious conduct, such as entering the appellant’s home without a warrant,
    or threatening or assaulting the appellant, that may well have tipped the
    balance in favour of exclusion.  The same holds true in terms of the nature
    and quantity of the drugs seized – a small amount of marijuana may well have
    yielded a different result.  In our view, this is precisely the dichotomy
    of result that s. 24(2) envisions and that <i>Collins</i> and its progeny
    permit.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    mentioned above, we would not characterize the breaches as deliberate. Even
    if they were deliberate, however, that alone would not lead automatically
    to exclusion. It is true that in the case law, deliberateness is a factor
    pointing strongly towards excluding the evidence.  As Peter Hogg states in <i>Constitutional
    Law in Canada</i>, 5th ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2007) at §41.9(a), “[w]here
    the police have deliberately violated the Charter in order to obtain incriminating
    evidence, then the use of the evidence would tend to bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute.”  However, a finding that a violation was deliberate
    does not end the inquiry altogether.  The drafters’ rejection of the American
    exclusionary rule (as recorded in <i>Collins</i> at p. 16 and subsequent
    case law) makes clear that s. 24(2) was intended as a balancing test, with
    no single factor trumping the others.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    short, police conduct is rarely determinative of the s. 24(2) analysis.  A
    trial judge engaged in a proper s. 24(2) analysis can find serious police
    misconduct and, because of other factors in play, legitimately admit the
    evidence improperly obtained.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    trial judge’s ruling in this case was faithful to the proper analytical approach
    under s. 24(2).  He described the police misconduct in blunt terms.  He did
    not condone it at all – he condemned it.  And then, he admitted the evidence
    because of his careful assessment of all three <i>Collins</i> factors.  In
    particular, he focused – appropriately – on the “serious social evi[l]” that
    is cocaine trafficking: <i>R. v. Jacoy</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 46 at 55
    (S.C.C.).  The<i> </i>words of Lamer J. in <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1987), 34
    C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 123-24 (S.C.C.), serve as a reminder of the often irreparable
    harms for which cocaine traffickers bear responsibility:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Those who import
    and market hard drugs for lucre are responsible for the gradual but inexorable
    degeneration of many of their fellow human beings as a result of their becoming

    their families, these importers must also be made to bear their fair share
    of the guilt for the innumerable serious crimes of all sorts committed by
    addicts in order to feed their demand for drugs.  Such persons, with few
    exceptions (as an example, the guilt of addicts who import not only to meet
    but also to finance their needs is not necessarily the same in degree as
    that of cold-blooded non-users), should, upon conviction, in my respectful
    view, be sentenced to and actually serve long periods of penal servitude.</p>

    similar point, and its logical consequence, admission of the evidence, was
    made by Cory J. in <i>Silveira</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 504-05:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The last major
    factor to be considered in the s. 24(2) analysis is the effect the exclusion
    of the evidence would have on the administration of justice.  The outcome
    of this issue was not seriously contested by the appellant.  The appellant
    was charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking and trafficking
    in a hard drug in significant quantities.  These are offences that can have
    a catastrophic effect on society and that carry with them a provision for
    imprisonment for life.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Drug trafficking

    is no doubt that the present case involved the interprovincial transport
    of a very large amount of cocaine.  The seized cocaine was estimated to be
    worth between $2,463,000 and $4,575,000.  The traffickers stood to profit
    handsomely from the long chain of social ills that would have flowed from
    the sale of 77 pounds of cocaine.  </p>

    summary, <i>Collins</i> articulates a three-part test for analysis under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge engaged in a full and faithful
    application of the test.  <i> Mann</i> states at para. 57 that
    “[j]ust as there is no automatic exclusionary rule, there can be no automatic
    inclusion of evidence either.”  A long line of cases, from <i>Duguay </i>(1989)
    to <i>Mellenthin</i> (1992) to <i>Silveira </i>(1995) to <i>Stillman</i> (1997)
    to <i>Buhay </i>(2003) to <i>Mann </i>(2004) to <i>Chaisson </i>(2006), has
    placed an umbrella of deference over appellate review of s. 24(2) rulings
    made by trial judges.  In our view, this umbrella must provide equal shelter
    to decisions to exclude and decisions to admit evidence.  Absent a legal
    error or an unreasonable finding, rulings in both categories should be affirmed.  The
    trial judge in this case committed neither error and his ruling is, therefore,

    for the reasons stated, we believe that without minimizing the seriousness
    of the police officer’s conduct or in any way condoning it, it was open to
    the trial judge to find that reasonable members of the community could well
    conclude that the exclusion of 77 pounds of cocaine, with a street value

    only to change his mind within a day, makes sense only to the extent that
    it dovetails completely with the most incriminating aspects of his possession
    of the cocaine.  The idea that he drove for 48 hours without looking into
    the back of the vehicle to see the presence of the boxes or even to check
    to confirm the presence of his own baggage is, in my view, ridiculous.  At
    the same time, his failure to notice the boxes is contradicted by his statement

    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this case,
    although I am satisfied that the accused was fully aware of the contents
    of the boxes, at the very least it can be said any failure to investigate
    amounted to wilful blindness.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Since he was
    driving when stopped and therefore had charge of the vehicle containing two
    large boxes with 77 pounds of cocaine, and had been in the vehicle for over
    48 consecutive hours, I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that he
    was aware of the contents of the cardboard boxes, although sealed, and as
    the driver of the vehicle had control of its contents when stopped by police.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this passage, the trial judge identified the elements of possession – knowledge
    and control – and made permissible findings, based on the evidence, relating
    to them.  We can see no legal error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s decision is far removed from being unreasonable.  Indeed,
    the facts in this case invite adoption of the analysis of McEachern C.J.B.C.
    in <i>R.. v. To</i> (1992), 16 B.C.A.C. 223 (
    <st1:country-region

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I have reached
    the conclusion that it would be legitimate, on the broad facts of this case,
    to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the plastic bag
    contained a prohibited drug.  In fact, I think that would be the only reasonable
    inference which could be drawn.  I believe that not just because the accused
    was found in physical control of the drugs, but also because of the highly
    suspicious circumstances and the immense quantity and value of the drugs.  These
    facts make it so unlikely that such a large quantity of drugs would be entrusted
    to anyone who did not know what was in the bags that such a possibility may
    safely be rejected.  In addition, his antecedent, highly suspicious conduct,
    most of which was proven affirmatively before he gave his disbelieved evidence,
    make it impossible to draw any inferences which would displace the legitimate
    inference which may be drawn from physical possession that he knew what he
    was possessing.</p>

    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his application of the doctrine
    of reasonable doubt by failing to apply the <i>W.(D.)</i> test properly,
    thereby reversing the burden of proof.  Specifically, the appellant submits
    that once the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence and indicated
    that he was not left in reasonable doubt concerning it, he needed to continue
    to the third stage of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis and consider whether, on
    the basis of the evidence he did accept, he was convinced beyond a reasonable
    doubt of the appellant’s guilt.</p>

    case concerns the admission at trial of evidence of a large amount of cocaine,
    seized from a car being driven by the appellant, in circumstances involving
    the deliberate breach of the appellant’s constitutional rights under ss.
    8 and 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Although the trial judge found the breaches
    to be extremely serious, he nonetheless held that the evidence should not
    be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In the trial judge’s opinion,
    the seriousness of the breaches “pale[d] in comparison to the criminality
    involved in the possession for the purpose of distribution of 77 pounds of
    cocaine”.  He thus admitted the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the trial judge’s findings of fact, the <i>Charter</i> violations were not
    only very serious, they were intentional.  The police officer knew that he
    did not have reasonable and probable grounds to stop the car or search it.  In
    spite of that, he proceeded.  Then, when he testified at the appellant’s
    trial, the officer misled the court about the reasons he stopped and searched
    the car in an attempt to justify his improper actions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, this question arises: at what point does serious police
    misconduct, which led to the discovery and seizure of real evidence of a
    substantial quantity of drugs, so taint the administration of justice as
    to require the exclusion of the evidence?  The answer requires a delicate
    balancing of society’s commitment to the protection of individual liberties
    guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i> and its interest in the effective detection
    and prosecution of serious crime.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    colleagues would uphold the admission of the cocaine primarily on the ground
    that this court should defer to the trial judge’s admissibility ruling.  On
    this record, I disagree.  A trial judge’s analysis under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> attracts
    considerable deference from this court.  But appellate intervention is both
    warranted and required where – as here – the decision to admit evidence is
    tainted by legal error.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in his approach to
    the requisite balancing exercise at the final stage of the s. 24(2) analysis
    mandated by <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In particular,
    the trial judge failed to address whether condoning the constitutional misconduct
    in this case, by admitting the evidence of the cocaine, would exact a greater
    toll on the integrity of the justice system than would excluding it.  Moreover,
    when assessing the effect of excluding the cocaine on the reputation of the
    administration of justice, the trial judge focused – to the virtual exclusion
    of all other relevant considerations – on the seriousness of the crime alleged
    and the significance of the cocaine to the Crown’s case.  This too was an
    error.  As a result of these errors, it falls to this court to determine
    afresh whether the evidence of the cocaine should have been admitted.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case where a police officer made a good faith error in judgment,
    misunderstood the extent of his authority, engaged in trivial or inadvertent
    constitutional violations, or is being held to an unduly harsh assessment
    with the benefit of hindsight.  This is a case where the police officer’s
    actions, both at the time of the detention of the appellant and the search
    of the vehicle, were deliberate, without legal justification, and disdainful
    of the rights and freedoms protected by the <i>Charter</i>.  Moreover, the
    officer attempted to distort the truth-seeking function of the court during
    his trial testimony by misleading the court about his conduct.  With respect,
    these actions were not merely “flawed decisions”, “a serious mistake”, or
    the product of a “flawed decision-making process”, as my colleagues suggest
    in their reasons.  They were intentional violations of the appellant’s constitutional
    rights that undermine the integrity of the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it is always distasteful to exclude important and reliable evidence in a
    serious case such as this, reasonable and informed members of the community
    would not countenance this type of police misconduct.  To admit the evidence
    of the cocaine, on this record, would strike at the heart of the values enshrined
    in the <i>Charter</i>.  Conse-quently, in my view, the court must refuse
    to condone, and must dissociate itself, from such conduct.  While the exclusion
    of the cocaine could bring the administration of justice into disrepute,
    on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, the admission of the
    cocaine would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal on this ground.  Because the evidence of the cocaine
    should be excluded at trial, and it is essential to the Crown’s case, I would
    set aside the appellant’s conviction and enter an acquittal.</p>

    Brian Bertoncello testified on the <i>Charter voir dire</i> that he decided
    to stop the SUV driven by the appellant because the vehicle’s missing front
    licence plate and the rate of speed of the vehicle (the posted speed limit)
    aroused his suspicions “a little bit”.  He also said that he suspected that
    the driver might be a suspended driver because he was driving a rental vehicle.<a

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    when he stopped the vehicle, the officer knew that the absence of a front
    licence plate on the SUV did not constitute an offence under the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8, because the SUV was from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta<b>,</b> where no front vehicle plate is required.  He also knew that
    the driver of the SUV was not speeding.  Nevertheless, as the trial judge
    observed, “despite the fact that the SUV was apparently being driven in accordance
    with the law”, Bertoncello stopped the vehicle and questioned its two male
    occupants, the appellant and his co-accused, Sean Friesen.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    asked why he persisted in pulling over the SUV when he knew that no offence
    had been committed, Bertoncello attempted to justify his conduct on the grounds
    that his emergency lights had already been engaged, there were other vehicles
    travelling behind him, his “integrity” and that of the police were in issue,
    and he wanted to ensure that the operator of the SUV was eligible to drive
    in Ontario.  He did not suggest, nor does the record indicate, that he had
    any legitimate highway traffic or public safety concerns when he stopped
    the SUV.  As found by the trial judge, Bertoncello’s suspicion that the driver “might
    be a person suspended from operating a motor vehicle” was “wild speculation” and
    his professed concern about the effect on other motorists’ perception of
    the “integrity” of the police could “in no way constitute reasonable grounds” for
    the detention of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    the vehicle was pulled over, Bertoncello told the appellant that he had been
    stopped because the SUV had no front licence plate.  When questioning the
    appellant, Bertoncello noticed clothing and bags on the back seat of the
    SUV and a silhouette of two boxes and bags in the rear cargo compartment.  After
    arresting the appellant for driving while suspended, Bertoncello told him
    that he would be searching the SUV, incident to the appellant’s arrest, to
    look for the appellant’s missing driver’s licence. The appellant co-operated
    throughout.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bertoncello
    did not ask the appellant or Friesen if he could search the SUV.  Moreover,
    there was no evidence that Bertoncello considered obtaining a warrant to
    search the SUV.  Although my colleagues suggest that “it is arguable” that
    Bertoncello had enough information to warrant a search of the SUV, the officer
    admitted that he did not have reasonable grounds to obtain a warrant to search
    the vehicle for drugs or weapons.  The trial judge agreed, holding that Bertoncello’s “avowed
    purpose for the search was certainly not reasonable”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    he maintained that his search pertained to the appellant’s driving offence,
    Bertoncello testified that he was suspicious of “a possibility” that there
    were drugs, weapons or cash inside the SUV.  Under cross-examination, he
    admitted that drugs and weapons were always in the back of his mind before
    and during the vehicle search.  He eventually conceded that he searched the
    SUV for drugs or weapons, as well as for the appellant’s driver’s licence.  He
    also acknowledged that, apart from the driver’s licence, he did not expect
    to find any other evidence relating to the offence of driving under suspension
    when searching the SUV.  He agreed that the licence itself was not required
    to prove this offence.</p>

    started the search of the vehicle at the back of the SUV.  He made no effort
    to search the two jackets and bags of clothes that he had observed in plain
    view on the back seat of the SUV.  Instead, accompanied by one of two other
    police constables who had arrived at the scene, Bertoncello opened the unlocked
    hatchback rear door of the vehicle and noticed two banker’s boxes and two
    duffle bags inside the cargo compart-ment.  The boxes, including their handles,
    were completely sealed with tape, so that no one could look inside.    </p>

    first examined the contents of one of the bags in the cargo compart-ment,
    which he was told belonged to Friesen.  Nothing untoward was discovered.  He
    next opened one of the sealed boxes and discovered packages of a substance
    that appeared to be cocaine, whereupon he arrested the appellant and Friesen
    for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  Only then did
    Bertoncello ask the appellant about the boxes.  The appellant told him that
    he did not know about the cocaine and “the boxes were there from … Friesen”.  Opening
    the second box revealed additional packages of cocaine.  The two boxes contained
    a total of 35 kilograms (about 77 pounds) of cocaine, having an estimated
    street value of approximately $2.4 to $4.6 million.</p>

    the trial judge’s findings, I agree that the stop of the SUV and the detention
    of the appellant were unlawful and violated the appellant’s s. 9 <i>Charter</i> rights.  I
    also agree that Bertoncello had no right to search the vehicle incident to
    the appellant’s arrest.  The appellant had not been arrested for a drug-related
    offence but, rather, for driving under suspension.  Consequently, any search
    for evidence incident to arrest had to be restricted to evidence of the driving
    offence and could not be converted into a search for drugs.  See for example, <i>R.
    v. Caprara</i> (2006), 211 O.A.C. 211 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 7.  The trial judge correctly held that the warrantless search
    of the SUV was without reasonable cause, that it was not a valid search incident
    to arrest, and that it infringed the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.  </p>
  <h2>(2)       Should the Evidence be Excluded Under Section 24(2)?</h2>

    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> provides: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where, in proceedings
    under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner
    that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this <i>Charter</i>,
    the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to
    all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring
    the administration of justice into disrepute. </p>
  <h2>(i)        Controlling Principles</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principles that inform a s. 24(2) <i>Charter</i> application are well-settled.  Four
    are particularly relevant in this case.  First, in <i>Collins, supra</i> at
    pp. 16-17, Lamer J. emphasized that the applicable test under s. 24(2) is
    “whether the <i>admission of the evidence </i>[could] bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute”. [Emphasis in original.]  He also said:   </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he purpose
    of s. 24(2) is to prevent having the administration of justice brought into <u>further
    disrepute</u> by the admission of the evidence in the proceedings.  <i>This
    further disrepute will result from</i> the admission of evidence that would
    deprive the accused of a fair hearing, or from <i>judicial condonation of
    unacceptable conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial agencies</i>.  <i>It
    will also be necessary to consider any disrepute that may result from the
    exclusion of the evidence</i>.  <i>It would be inconsistent with the purpose
    of s.&nbsp;24(2) to exclude evidence if its exclusion would bring the administration
    of justice into greater disrepute than would its admission.  </i>[Underlining
    in original; emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More
    recently, in <i>R. v. Buhay</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para.
    72, the Supreme Court of Canada described the s. 24(2) inquiry in this fashion: “The
    question under s. 24(2) is whether the system’s repute will be better served
    by the admission or the exclusion of the evidence.”  Justice Arbour explained
    at paras. 72-73 that the disrepute that may result from the exclusion of
    the evidence is a necessary consideration under s.&nbsp;24(2).  She elaborated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the end of
    the day, though, the constitutional question is whether the <i>admission</i> of
    the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. … The
    decision to exclude evidence always represents a balance between the interests
    of truth on one side and the integrity of the judicial system on the other.

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as my colleagues indicate in their reasons, the concept of “disrepute” under
    s. 24(2) necessarily involves some element of community views.  In <i>Collins</i> at
    pp. 17-18, in adopting what he termed the “reasonable person test”, Lamer
    J. endorsed the following test for the application of s. 24(2): “Would the
    admission of the evidence bring the administration of justice into disrepute
    in the eyes of the reasonable man, dispassionate and fully apprised of the
    circumstances of the case?”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Lamer J. also said at p. 17:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Finally, it must
    be emphasized that even though the inquiry under s. 24(2) will necessarily
    focus on the specific prosecution, it is the long-term consequences of regular
    admission or exclusion of this type of evidence on the repute of the administration
    of justice which must be considered.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    caution informs the consideration of community values mandated under s.&nbsp;24(2).  The
    decision whether to admit evidence is not an uncontrolled, discretionary
    decision to be based on considerations that are idiosyncratic to a particular
    community at a particular time.  Rather, it is the long-term values of the
    community at large that are engaged by s. 24(2).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    a s. 24(2) inquiry requires consideration of “all the circumstances” bearing
    on the admission of the challenged evidence.  In <i>Collins</i>, the numerous
    factors to be considered and balanced under s. 24(2) were grouped into three
    categories, according to the way in which they affect the repute of the administration
    of justice: (i) the effect of the admission of the evidence on trial fairness;
    (ii) the seriousness of the police misconduct; and (iii) the effect on the
    repute of the administration of justice of excluding or admitting the evidence.  This
    three-staged inquiry remains the governing analytical approach to a s. 24(2)
    analysis.  See for example, <i>R. v. Law</i> (2002), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 449
    (S.C.C.) at para. 33; and <i>Buhay </i>at para. 41.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge’s findings of fact on a s. 24(2) application attract significant
    deference from this court.  Those findings cannot be overturned absent palpable
    and overriding error: see <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.  Deference
    also applies to decisions of trial judges on questions of evidentiary exclusion
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  See for example, <i>R. v. Mann</i> (2004),
    185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) at para. 59; <i>Buhay</i> at para. 44; <i>Law</i> at
    para. 32; and <i>R. v. Belnavis</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405 (S.C.C.)
    at para. 35.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    principle of deference, however, is subject to important limitations.  A
    trial judge’s s.&nbsp;24(2) ruling must be reasonable and error-free.  In <i>R.
    v. Silveira</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 450 at para. 144, the Supreme Court
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the outset,
    it is appropriate to bear in mind that, in a series of cases, this Court
    has held that findings of the courts below pertaining to s. 24(2) issues
    should not be overturned <i>unless there has been “some apparent error as
    to the applicable principles or rules of law, or … a finding that is unrea-sonable”.</i>  [Citations

    applies with equal force to decisions to admit or exclude evidence under
    s. 24(2).  Section 24(2) rulings are based on an assessment of whether the
    admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute.  This assessment is grounded in factors established through testimony,
    often requiring an appreciation of the credibility of witnesses.  Accordingly,
    subject to the limitations that I have mentioned, deference is implicated
    on any appellate review of a <i>Charter</i> s. 24(2) ruling.</p>

    respect of the first question – trial fairness – the trial judge accepted
    that the admission of the evidence would not render the appellant’s trial
    unfair.  He was correct to do so.  Both at trial and on appeal, counsel agreed
    that trial fairness is not engaged in this case.  The challenged evidence – cocaine – was
    non-conscriptive, real evidence that existed independently of the violations

  <h2><i>Seriousness of the Charter Violations</i></h2>

    next question under the <i>Collins</i> inquiry concerns the seriousness of
    the police misconduct at issue.  Particularly strong deference is owed to
    the trial judge’s finding that the police officer’s <i>Charter</i> violations
    were <b>“</b>extremely serious<b>”</b>: see <i>Buhay</i> at paras. 47 and
    52; <i>Law</i> at paras. 32-38; and <i>R. v. Shankar </i>(2007), 222 O.A.C.

    flowed directly from the trial judge’s adverse assessment of Bertoncello’s
    credibility.</p>

    to the officer’s conduct and the officer’s explanations for his actions,
    and that they neither minimize the seriousness of the officer’s conduct nor
    condone it.  With respect, I conclude that the effect of my colleagues’ reasons
    is to do precisely the opposite.  In my view, without acknowledging it, my
    colleagues mount a significant attack on the findings of fact that were made
    by the trial judge at the second stage of his <i>Collins</i> analysis<b>, </b>including
    his key finding that the <i>Charter</i> breaches were extremely serious.  Although
    they attempt to shelter their attack under what they term the “umbrella of
    deference” that applies to appellate review of s. 24(2) rulings made by trial
    judges, in reality, the majority seek to diminish the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violations
    as found by the trial judge in two discernible ways.</p>

    first element<b> </b>of my colleagues’
    attack on the trial judge’s factual findings is their effort to “read down” the
    seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breaches as found by the trial judge by
    injecting their own findings about the police misconduct into the factual
    matrix of this case.  This is revealed by their description of the police
    misconduct as consisting of “flawed decisions” or “a serious mistake” by
    Bertoncello, or as flowing from his “flawed decision-making process”.  With
    respect, this recharacterization of the police misconduct flies in the face
    of the trial judge’s factual analysis and findings.</p>

    of the police officer’s actions as flawed decisions, mistakes or the product
    of flawed decision-making equates the officer’s actions with mere errors
    in judgment.  Yet the trial judge explicitly found that the officer’s<b> </b>conduct
    in violating the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights was “brazen” and “flagrant”.  He
    further found that the officer was aware that he lacked legal justification
    for the detention and search of the SUV and that he proceeded in any event.  He
    also held that the officer was not “simply careless”, acting in “error or
    ignorance” or on “an honest but mistaken belief”
    in assessing his authority during the detention and search.  To the contrary,
    he acted in bad faith.  Nor were there urgent or exigent circumstances such
    as might warrant the search of the SUV.  Further, the officer actively sought
    to mislead the court at trial with his “contrived” and “incredible” explanations
    for his conduct.  These are not the hallmarks of mere flawed decision-making,
    innocent mistakes or errors in judgment.  </p>

    colleagues acknowledge that the deliberateness of a <i>Charter</i> breach
    is “a factor pointing strongly towards excluding the evidence” obtained as
    a result of the breach.  However, they indicate that they “would not characterize
    the breaches as deliberate” and stress that the trial judge did not specifically
    do so.  </p>

    it is true that the trial judge did not use the word “deliberate” in describing
    the breaches, it is clear from his reasons that he did not regard the <i>Charter</i> violations
    as trivial or technical, nor did he describe them as inadvertent or unintentional.  To
    the contrary, a full reading of his ruling makes it clear that he regarded
    the breaches as wilful and deliberate.  To conclude otherwise is to undercut
    both the tenor and substance of the trial judge’s numerous strongly-worded
    factual findings, including his finding<b>s</b> that the officer’s conduct
    was “brazen” and “flagrant” and that the <i>Charter</i> breaches were “extremely
    serious”.  In my view, absent legal error by the trial judge – which my colleagues
    do not assert – this court may not attempt to ameliorate the nature of the
    police misconduct where to do so runs afoul of the trial judge’s unequivocal
    factual findings. </p>

    from the Supreme Court of Canada confirms that such an approach exceeds the
    scope of permissible appellate review.  For example, <i>R. v. Chaisson</i> (2006),
    206 C.C.C. (3d) 1, a case cited – but not otherwise discussed – by my colleagues
    in their reasons, also involved alleged breaches of ss. 8 and 9 of the <i>Charter</i> and
    a subsequent s.&nbsp;24(2) analysis.  In <i>Chaisson</i>, the Supreme Court
    held that it is impermissible for an appellate court to recast the issues
    in a constitutional infringement case by substituting its own findings of
    fact for those of a trial judge.  To recharacterize the nature of the police
    misconduct in this case, notwithstanding the trial judge’s clear factual
    findings, ignores the <i>Chaisson</i> caution.  </p>

    second, and related, element of my colleagues’ attack on the trial judge’s
    findings regarding the <i>Charter</i> breaches is an attempt to minimize
    those findings by holding that the breaches did not have “a serious effect
    on the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights” and that the effects of the breaches
    on the appellant’s rights were
    “relatively minor”.  In several places in their reasons, with little reference
    to the trial judge’s finding that the breaches were “extremely serious”,
    my colleagues emphasize the trial judge’s comment that the breaches did not
    fall within the most egregious category.  They defer to this finding by the
    trial judge and rely on it to embark on their own assessment of the seriousness
    of the breaches and the police officer’s misconduct.  With respect, I do
    not think that my colleagues’ approach reflects a fair reading of the trial
    judge’s ruling or the import of his findings.  I say this for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge made no finding that the effects of the breaches on the appellant’s
    rights were “relatively minor” or not particularly serious.  To the contrary,
    although the trial judge recognized that the breaches were not the most serious
    set of <i>Charter</i> breaches imaginable, he explicitly qualified this acknowledgement
    by stressing that the police officer acted in bad faith and in blatant disregard
    for more than one of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  For the trial
    judge, these latter factors were controlling and compelled the conclusion
    that the breaches were “extremely serious”.  By focusing on circumstances
    that they conclude attenuate the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breaches,
    my colleagues afford no deference to and essentially ignore this central
    finding.  In effect, they imply that notwithstanding the trial judge’s express
    finding to the contrary, the breaches were not very serious.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there is no doubt that the trial judge’s overall evaluation of the seriousness
    of the breaches took into consideration the effects of the police officer’s
    misconduct on the appellant.  At the start of his assessment of the seriousness
    of the breaches, the trial judge referred to Arbour J.’s enunciation in <i>Buhay</i> at
    para. 52 of the factors that may be taken into account at the second stage
    of a <i>Collins</i> inquiry, including “the obtrusiveness of the search,
    the individual’s expectation of privacy in the area searched and the existence
    of reasonable and probable grounds”.  The trial judge also expressly acknowledged
    that the breaches involved no force, coercion or threats and observed, more
    than once, that no violence was involved.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is thus apparent that the trial judge turned his mind to the effects of the
    breaches on the appellant from the very outset of his analysis of the seriousness
    of the police misconduct.  His consideration of the effects of the breaches
    on the appellant was subsumed in his scrutiny of the police officer’s misconduct
    and his overall evaluation of the gravity of the breaches.   </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    while my colleagues state that the illegal search of the SUV was the search “of
    a car, nothing more”, and that the effect of the breaches on the appellant’s
    privacy interest “was not great”, the nature of the search and of the appellant’s
    privacy interest was not lost on the trial judge.  He<b> </b>was clearly
    aware that an individual’s expectation of privacy in the area searched by
    the police is a proper consideration when assessing the seriousness of a
    s. 8 <i>Charter</i> breach.  Indeed, the trial judge received submissions
    on the <i>Charter voir dire</i> from both the Crown and defence counsel regarding
    the appellant’s privacy interest in this case.  There is no basis on which
    to infer that he failed to consider or misapprehended this factor when evaluating
    the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breaches.    </p>

    this court, the appellant accepts that his privacy interest in the rented
    SUV was not high.  This was a proper concession.  A person’s expectation
    of privacy in a car is less than in a person’s home or office, or with respect
    to their physical person: see <i>Wise</i>,<i> supra</i> at p. 228; <i>Belnavis,

    does not mean, however, that the appellant had <i>no</i> privacy interest
    in the SUV or its contents.  The appellant had control of the SUV when it
    was stopped.  At the time of the stop, insofar as Bertoncello was aware,
    the appellant had done nothing illegal.  The boxes searched were in the rear
    cargo area of the SUV and were not in plain view.  Prior to the search, Bertoncello
    had glimpsed only a silhouette of the boxes.  In addition, the boxes were
    tightly sealed and their contents were not visible.  </p>

    the appellant appears to have been driving the SUV with the consent of Friesen,
    the lessee of the vehicle, with whom he was travelling and apparently sharing
    the driving from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Vancouver.  These facts can ground a reasonable expectation of privacy in
    the vehicle: <i>Belnavis, supra</i> at para. 23.  In <i>R. v. Calderon</i> (2004),
    188 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 98, this court accepted that both the driver
    and the passenger of a rented car had a “reasonably high” expectation of
    privacy in the locked trunk of the vehicle, where the contents were less
    visible and accessible than in the interior of a car.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also disagree with my colleagues that, given this court’s recent decision
    in <i>R. v. L.B.</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 730, the appellant’s denial of
    ownership of the boxes in the SUV is an “important factor” in this case.  In <i>L.B.</i>,
    when questioned by the police regarding the ownership of a seemingly discarded
    backpack, the accused denied that the backpack was his.  In those circumstances,
    this court held that the police were justified in regarding the backpack
    as having been abandoned and in conducting a search of its contents.  The
    court went on to conclude that no detention of the accused had occurred,
    the police officers acted in good faith, and any <i>Charter</i> breach that
    transpired was inadvertent and not a product of wilful or flagrant disregard
    of the accused’s constitutional rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts in <i>L.B.</i> stand in stark contrast to those in this case.  Here,
    the appellant’s assertion that the boxes had been placed in the SUV by Friesen
    was made <i>after</i> the unlawful detention of the appellant and <i>after</i> the
    illegal search of the vehicle and the discovery of the cocaine.  It was not
    until he was confronted by Bertoncello with the fact that cocaine had been
    found that the appellant denied ownership of the boxes.  Notwithstanding
    this denial, the appellant made no disclaimer of any privacy interest in
    the SUV.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the appellant’s privacy interest was a reasonable but reduced one.  While
    his expectation of privacy in the SUV and its contents was certainly not
    high, it was also not negligible.  The fact remains that his privacy interest
    was violated – unlawfully and intentionally.  While the existence of a reasonable
    expectation of privacy is highly relevant to the assessment of an inadvertent
    or good faith breach of the <i>Charter</i>, it is less relevant where – as
    here – the <i>Charter</i> violations were flagrant, brazen and not in good
    faith.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    even where the effect of a <i>Charter</i> violation on an accused is minimal,
    the Supreme Court of Canada has held that this factor must be weighed against
    the absence of a reasonable basis for the police conduct in issue.  For example,
    in <i>Mann, supra</i> the challenged search was held to be unconstitutional
    and the resulting evidence of marijuana was excluded because the police,
    in carrying out a permissible pat-down search, also searched an inner pocket
    on the accused’s sweater.  The effect on the accused of the extended search
    appears to have been negligible, since he was already being lawfully detained
    and searched.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court wrote at para. 56: “While a
    frisk search is a minimally intrusive search … the search of the appellant’s
    inner pocket must be weighed against the absence of <i>any</i> reasonable
    basis for justification.”  [Emphasis in original.]  Similarly, in this case,
    the effects of the search of the SUV and the sealed banker’s boxes must be
    measured in light of the fact that Bertoncello proceeded with the search
    based on nothing more than a suspicion or hunch that the vehicle might contain
    drugs or weapons.</p>

    my colleagues stress that the police misconduct in this case was not systemic
    in nature, indicative of an institutional or operational police policy, or
    the result of a planned and premeditated course of action or of the officer
    following a superior’s orders.  </p>

    do not dispute that the assessment of the seriousness of <i>Charter</i> breaches
    involves consideration of gradations of gravity, in the context of all the
    circumstances.  However, I do not accept that police misconduct is reduced
    to constitutional insignificance, or that its effects are minor or <i>de
    minimis</i>, because only one police officer, acting on his own, knowingly
    violates a citizen’s constitutional rights.  The protections afforded by
    the <i>Charter</i> are not limited to cases where systemic, institutional
    or premeditated police misconduct or state action is in issue.</p>

    the above reasons, I do not accept that it is open to this court on the facts
    of this case to suggest that the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breaches
    is diminished because the breaches did not have “a particularly serious effect
    on the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights”, or because the<b> </b>effects
    of the breaches on the appellant were “relatively minor”.  Indeed, contrary
    to my colleagues’ approach, the Crown acknowledged during oral argument before
    this court that the trial judge’s unchallenged factual findings “preclude
    attenuation of the seriousness of the breaches”. </p>

    the end, the effects of the <i>Charter</i> violations on the appellant is
    but one component of a constellation of factors relevant to the seriousness
    of the breaches.  Having taken the nature and effects of the breaches into
    account, it was open to the trial judge to hold on the evidence that the
    breaches were extremely serious.  In the absence of legal error, which is
    not suggested by my colleagues, the import of that finding cannot be undermined.  Given
    that intentional police misconduct is involved, the real issue on this appeal
    is whether the harm to the repute of the administration of justice that would
    be occasioned by the admission of the evidence is constitutionally tolerable.</p>
  <h2><i>Repute of the Administration of Justice</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    final question from <i>Collins</i> concerns the negative impact, if any,
    on the administration of justice that would be occasioned by the admission
    of the evidence.  In ruling that the evidence of the cocaine should be admitted,
    the trial judge reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The third <i>Collins</i>]
    factor relates to the seriousness of the offence and the importance of the
    evidence to the case for the Crown.  In the case at bar, the Crown, it would
    appear, has no case without the drugs.  More significantly, in view of the
    vast quantity of cocaine in question, these charges are extremely serious.  It
    is important to consider the degree of criminality involved in the possession
    for the purposes of distribution of 77 pounds of cocaine and the societal
    damage resulting from that amount of such a dangerous drug.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In <i>R. v. Puskas</i>,
    Justice Moldaver stated at [para. 25]:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>To exclude the
    evidence under these circumstances, where the guilt of the respondent for
    a serious offence is clearly established by real evidence and where the exclusion
    of the evidence would result in his acquittal, would, in my opinion, have
    a greater negative effect on the repute of justice than its admission.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I adopt that
    statement and find that it applies to the facts of this case.  Accordingly,
    after carefully balancing the serious-ness of the breaches against the effect
    of exclusion, I am satisfied that the evidence should not be excluded.  As
    blatant as the arresting officer’s behaviour was in conducting the detention
    and the search and as brazen as his explanation for his actions in this court,
    they pale in comparison to the criminality involved in the possession for
    the purposes of distribution of 77 pounds of cocaine, if such is proven.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his approach to the balancing
    exercise contemplated at the final stage of the <i>Collins</i> inquiry by
    failing to balance the factors weighing in favour of excluding the evidence
    against the factors supporting its admission.  In so doing, the appellant
    submits, the trial judge also incorrectly relied on the decision of this
    court in <i>R. v. Puskas</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 548.  I agree with these
    submissions for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central basis for the trial judge’s decision to admit the evidence of the
    cocaine was the seriousness of the offence charged, given the nature and
    quantity of the drug seized.  This is evident from his statements that, “[i]n
    view of the vast quantity of cocaine in question, these charges are extremely
    serious” and “[i]t is important to consider the degree of criminality involved”.  It
    is also apparent from his acceptance of the Crown’s argument on the <i>voir
    dire</i> that the seriousness of Bertoncello’s conduct “pale[d] in comparison
    to the criminality involved”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no doubt that the offence charged in this case was serious and it involved
    a large quantity of a dangerous drug.  These factors, of course, were proper
    and necessary considerations at the third stage of the trial judge’s s. 24(2)
    inquiry.  The trial judge’s concern about the potential damage to society
    arising from the illegal distribution of such a large amount of cocaine was
    also legitimate.  The devastating effects of cocaine use and the public interest
    in preventing such use need no elaboration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    just as police misconduct, by itself, is not determinative of a s. 24(2)
    assessment,  the seriousness of the alleged crime is but one factor, albeit
    an important one, to be considered at the third stage of the <i>Collins</i> inquiry.  The
    plain language of s.&nbsp;24(2) requires that the admissibility determination
    be made after weighing and balancing “all the circumstances”.  The jurisprudence
    does not support the proposition that any one factor, including the seriousness
    of the criminality at issue, “trumps” all other relevant factors on a s.
    24(2) analysis.  In <i>R. v. Burlingham</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.)
    at para. 50, Iacobucci J. bluntly warned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I underscore
    that we should never lose sight of the fact that even a person accused of
    the most heinous crimes, and no matter the likelihood that he or she actually
    committed those crimes, is entitled to the full protection of the <i>Charter</i>.  Short-cutting
    or short-circuiting those rights affects not only the accused, but also the
    entire reputation of the criminal justice system.  It must be emphasized
    that the goals of preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system
    as well as promoting the decency of investigatory techniques are of fundamental
    importance in applying s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>These goals operate
    independently of the type of crime for which the individual stands accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the third stage of the <i>Collins</i> analysis, the relevant question is
    not that posed by the trial judge, namely, whether the established <i>Charter</i> violation “pales” in
    comparison to the criminality involved.  Rather, it is whether condoning
    the constitutional misconduct by admitting evidence obtained in violation
    of important <i>Charter</i> rights would do more harm to the integrity of
    the justice system than would excluding evidence that is essential to the
    Crown’s case against an accused charged with a serious crime.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    failing to address this question, the trial judge misunderstood and failed
    to undertake the requisite balancing exercise under s. 24(2).  While the
    trial judge said that he had
    “carefully balanced the seriousness of the breaches against the effect of <i>exclusion</i>” [emphasis
    added] of the evidence, he made no assessment of the effect on the repute
    of the administration of justice arising from the <i>admission</i> of the
    evidence, given the serious <i>Charter</i> violations that he had found,
    and in light of all the circumstances surrounding those violations.  In particular,
    the trial judge did not advert to the negative impact that admitting the
    evidence would have on the repute of the administration of justice as a consequence
    of the judicial condonation of the extremely serious <i>Charter</i> breaches
    that he found had occurred.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    colleagues write that the admission of evidence where there has been a <i>Charter</i> breach
    should not be viewed, by itself, as a condonation by the court of the <i>Charter</i> breach.  I
    agree that inherent to the third stage of the <i>Collins</i> analysis is
    the possibility that unlawfully obtained evidence may be admitted notwithstanding
    a <i>Charter</i> violation.  Thus, for example, if evidence is obtained as
    the result of inadvertent or inconsequential <i>Charter</i> breaches or when
    the police acted in good faith, its admission may be justified.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    when a court is faced with evidence that was gathered by the police in deliberate
    and serious violation of their constitutional obligations, the admissibility
    scales may tip the other way.  The claim that a police officer’s intentional
    constitutional misconduct has been condemned, rather than condoned, by the
    courts rings hollow when evidence deliberately obtained in serious violation
    of an accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights is relied on to secure a conviction.</p>

    is important to remember that the unlawful obtaining of evidence by the police
    in violation of an accused’s fundamental constitutional rights itself diminishes
    the integrity of the administration of justice.  As Lamer J. emphasized in <i>Collins</i> at
    pp. 16-17, the purpose of s. 24(2) is to avoid exacerbating the damage already
    caused to the repute of the administration of justice through the “judicial
    condonation of unacceptable conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial
    agencies”.  See also <i>Buhay</i> at para. 70.  To similar effect, this court
    recently noted in <i>Harris, supra</i> at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Were the court
    to admit evidence obtained through a serious breach of an accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights,
    the admission of that evidence could reasonably be seen as judicial condonation

    to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  [Citations omitted.]</p>

    pertinent is the observation of Sopinka J. in <i>R. v. Kokesch</i> (1990),
    61 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (S.C.C.) at 226: “The Court must refuse to condone, and
    must dissociate itself from, egregious police conduct.”  [Citations omitted.]  And
    as Iacobucci J. observed in <i>Burlingham, supra </i>at para. 25, the purpose

    reliability of the evidence, the amount and type of the drug seized, and
    the seriousness of the alleged crime do not overwhelm the s.&nbsp;24(2) analysis
    at the expense of the consideration of other factors that are relevant to
    the admissibility determination.  Were it otherwise, whenever serious crime
    is alleged in circumstances where significant constitutional violations lead
    to the discovery of important, non-conscriptive real evidence, the evidence
    would be admitted under s. 24(2).  This approach must be rejected.  It would
    deprive those charged with serious crimes of the protection of the individual
    freedoms afforded to all Canadians under the <i>Charter</i> and, in effect,
    declare that in the administration of the criminal law “the ends justify
    the means”.  That theory is not the foundation of our constitutional order
    and system of criminal justice.  It would be tantamount to treating s. 24(2)
    as a rule of virtually automatic evidentiary inclusion in the circumstances
    of serious crime involving non-conscriptive real evidence of a dangerous
    drug.  The Supreme Court of Canada has clearly rejected this view of s. 24(2):

    while I, and surely most people, would like to see the appellant convicted
    and punished severely for the offences with which he is charged, the long-term
    effect of admitting evidence obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter
    on the basis that the offence is a very serious one, would lead to the result

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no doubt

    be con-victed of the counts against him. <i> It must not be forgotten, however,

    serious disregard for the appellant’s rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Although

    the search of an accused’s backyard was conducted under the authority of
    two search warrants, one of which was obtained after the police received
    information of suspected criminal activity through a Crimestoppers tip.  This
    court concluded that the police officers who conducted the search in reliance
    on the warrants – rather than on mere suspicion – acted in good faith.  Moreover,
    the search itself was of the accused’s backyard, where marijuana plants were
    in plain view.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    is not this case.  Here, there were no reasonable grounds to stop the SUV,
    the detention of the appellant was arbitrary, and the alleged basis of the
    unlawful detention was used by the police officer as a pretext to conduct
    an unlawful search for drugs in sealed boxes located in an area of the vehicle
    where the boxes and their contents were not plainly visible.  Consider again
    the findings of the trial judge: the police officer’s actions throughout
    were brazen, flagrant, wilful and not in good faith.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    colleagues offer the view that, in quoting from <i>Puskas</i>, the trial
    judge “was not asserting an exact factual analogy, but rather a similar outcome”.  With
    respect, this misses the point.  On a s. 24(2) analysis, the facts drive
    the outcome.  Where the facts in two s. 24(2) cases are materially different,
    there is no apt analogy between outcomes. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    on the facts as found by the trial judge, there was an additional important
    consideration that militated strongly in favour of the exclusion of the cocaine.  The
    trial judge held that the arresting officer knowingly violated the appellant’s
    constitutional rights and then offered explanations for his conduct in sworn
    testimony in court that were
    “contrived”, that “def[ied] credibility”, and that were “extremely difficult
    to accept as valid”.  Thus, the police officer compounded the gravity of
    his constitutional violations by attempting to mislead the court regarding
    his conduct during the criminal trial of the person whose fundamental rights
    were ignored.  This suggests an ongoing disregard for the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  At
    the third stage of his <i>Collins</i> analysis, the trial judge referred
    to this factor only briefly when he alluded to the officer’s “brazen …
    explanation for his actions in this court”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, in a proper case, the comprehensive analysis of all relevant
    circum-stances required under s. 24(2) can render this type of post-breach
    police misconduct highly relevant at the third stage of the <i>Collins</i> inquiry.  I
    say this for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    I again underscore that the plain language of s. 24(2) directs that regard
    be had to “all the circumstances” bearing on the admissibility of the evidence
    in question.  This broad language is sufficient to encompass the entirety
    of the police conduct relating to the constitutional misconduct under scrutiny.  In <i>R.
    v. Hynes</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 at para. 42, for example, the Supreme
    Court of Canada, when considering the scope of the phrase “all the circumstances” in
    s. 24(2), stated that when examining the admission of evidence under s. 24(2),
    trial judges are required to “evaluate these factors in the context of the
    trial as a whole and the requirements of essential fairness”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the integrity of the judicial system and the truth-seeking function of the
    courts lie at the heart of the admissibility inquiry envisaged under s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  Few actions more directly undermine both of these
    goals than misleading testimony in court from persons in authority.  Our
    system of criminal justice is fashioned on the collective expectation of
    the community that police officers who testify in a criminal case will do
    so honestly and impartially, unmotivated by self-interest or the desire to
    secure a conviction.  The central importance of this expectation cannot be
    overstated where the testimony is received in a criminal trial involving
    allegations of serious constitutional violations by the police.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    where, as here, individual freedoms guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i> are
    knowingly breached by a police officer acting in bad faith, subsequent efforts
    by the same officer to mislead the court about the basis for his conduct
    may be an important consideration at the third stage of the <i>Collins</i> inquiry.  See
    for example, the comments of Iacobucci J. of the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>Belnavis, supra </i>at para. 90 (dissenting in the result).  </p>
  <h2>IV.       Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    my colleagues note, in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , an automatic exclusionary rule applies to evidence obtained in violation
    of the protection afforded against unreasonable search and seizure under
    the Fourth Amendment to the American <i>Bill of Rights</i>.  Although the
    drafters of s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> rejected this strict exclusionary
    rule, preferring instead the type of nuanced balancing exercise ultimately
    described in <i>Collins</i>, Fourth Amendment jurisprudence can afford instructive
    insights into s. 24(2) analyses.  I can put it no better than did Justice
    Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. of the United States Supreme Court in his 1928
    dissenting opinion on <i>Olmstead v. U.S.,</i> 277 U.S. 438 at 470 when he
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[W]e must consider
    the two objects of desire both of which we cannot have and make up our minds
    which to choose.  It is desirable that criminals should be detected, and
    to that end that all available evidence should be used.  It also is desirable
    that the government should not itself foster and pay for other crimes, when
    they are the means by which the evidence is to be obtained.  If it pays its
    officers for having got evidence by crime I do not see why it may not as
    well pay them for getting it in the same way, and I can attach no importance
    to protestations of disapproval if it knowingly accepts and pays and announces
    that in future it will pay for the fruits.  We have to choose, and for my
    part I think it a less evil that some criminals should escape than that the
    government should play an ignoble part.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Closer
    to home, in<b> </b>his recent opinion in <i>R. v. Clayton</i>, [2007] S.C.J.
    No. 32 at para. 68, Binnie J. commented: “A society that valued police efficiency
    and effectiveness above other values would be a police state.”  He also made
    the following point at para. 68, quoting from <i>Mann, supra</i> at para.
    15:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Absent a law
    to the contrary, individuals are free to do as they please.  By contrast,
    the police (and more broadly, the state) may act only to the extent that
    they are empowered to do so by law.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>To the
    same effect, Sopinka J. observed in <i>Kokesch, supra</i> at p. 227: “Where
    the police have nothing but suspicion and no legal way to obtain other evidence,
    it follows that they must leave the suspect alone, not charge ahead and obtain
    evidence illegally and unconstitutionally.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the significant errors of law committed by the trial judge, his
    decision to admit the cocaine does not attract deference from this court.  The
    exclusion of evidence of serious criminality at a criminal trial is regrettable
    and not to be countenanced lightly, particularly where the evidence consists
    of real evidence of a significant quantity of drugs.  The cost of excluding
    such evidence is high: “Someone who was found guilty at trial of a
    … serious offence will evade conviction”: see <i>Collins</i> at p. 22.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But,
    in the end, where the evidence was obtained as a result of serious and deliberate
    police misconduct, including an attempt by a police officer to mislead the
    court about the basis for his impugned conduct, respect for the values enshrined
    in the <i>Charter</i> must take precedence and the court must dissociate
    itself from such misconduct.  What occurred here was disdainful of the rights
    and freedoms protected by the <i>Charter</i>.  Accordingly, on a proper balancing
    of all relevant factors in this case, I conclude that the trial judge’s decision
    to admit the evidence of the cocaine must be set aside.  While excluding
    the evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute, on
    the record in this case, the administration of justice would be brought into
    greater disrepute by admitting it.  To hold otherwise, on the facts and in
    the circumstances of this case, would invite the disregard of <i>Charter</i> rights
    by the police, with an unspoken “assurance of impunity”.<a href="#_ftn5"
