    appellant was charged on September 2004 with sexual assault and released
    on a promise to appear.  He was committed for trial in the Superior Court
    in September 2005 after a preliminary inquiry.  A trial date of March 13,
    2006 was fixed in November 2005.  The trial was scheduled for five days.  On
    the scheduled trial date, no trial court was available and the appellant’s
    trial could not proceed.  The trial was adjourned to November 20, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel did not oppose the adjournment.  He did, however, make it clear that
    he was preserving his client’s rights under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    proceedings in March were brief and there is no indication whether the dates
    in November referred to by Crown counsel were the first dates available for
    trial.  There is also no indication as to whether either counsel requested
    an earlier date from the trial coordinator.  The presiding judge did not
    comment on the length of the adjournment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 20, 2006, the case came on for trial before the same judge who had
    adjourned it on March 13, 2006.  That judge concluded that there had been
    a violation of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and stayed the sexual assault
    charge.  The Crown appeals from that order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    are satisfied, based on the Crown’s submissions, that the trial judge failed
    to engage in the s. 11(b) analysis mandated in <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992),
    71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In his reasons, the trial judge fixed almost
    exclusively on the adjournment in March 2006.  That adjournment resulted
    in an eight month institutional delay.  The trial judge stressed the failure
    to give this case any priority when the trial had to be rescheduled.  He
    referred to the absence of any administrative scheme to prioritize cases
    that were not reached on the first trial date.  There was in fact no evidence
    as to what administrative system, if any, was in place to address questions
    of priority when trials were rescheduled.  The trial judge was also critical
    of the Crown and the administrative staff’s failure to give effect to observations
    he had made in  a case several years earlier.  That case addressed delay
    occasioned by the need to reschedule a trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s comments about the need to give priority to cases that are
    not reached on the first trial date have merit.  All parties in the process,
    including the judge who is asked to grant the adjournment, should be alive
    to possible delay issues when a case is not reached on the scheduled trial
    date.  We note, however, that the trial judge proceeded on the basis of certain
    assumptions as to how this case came to be adjourned to November.  There
    was nothing on the record to indicate what steps, if any, were taken to prioritize
    this matter in March or whether anyone had requested that any such priority
    be given to the case.  No one, including this judge who granted the adjournment,
    turned their mind to the questions that should be addressed when a trial
    has to be rescheduled.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reading
    the reasons as a whole, we are satisfied that the trial judge effectively
    granted a stay because he was not satisfied with the Crown’s approach to
    the adjournment request in March 2006.  In doing so, the trial judge failed
    to give any weight to considerations that are important in the s. 11(b) analysis.  These
    are first, the societal interest in a trial on the merits.  That interest
    is particularly significant where, as here, an accused is charged with a
    very serious offence.  Second, the trial judge failed to consider the absence
    of any prejudice caused by the delay to the respondent’s fair trial right
    and the minimal prejudice caused to his liberty interest by the terms of
    his bail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the trial judge failed to conduct the <i>Morin</i> analysis, we do so and
    conclude as follows:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    total passage of time from the laying of the charge to the trial date, twenty-six
    months, is sufficiently long to trigger a consideration of all of the s.
    11(b) factors;  </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>institutional
    delay accounts for about five and a half months in the Ontario Court of Justice
    and about twelve months in the Superior Court for a total of just under eighteen
    months of institutional delay;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    other delays are delays inherent in the case (e.g. intake periods) and one
    adjournment of some two months during the preliminary inquiry that was mutually
    agreed on by counsel.  These delays in total account for eight months.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    regard to the administrative guidelines outlined in <i>Morin</i> for institutional
    delay, this case is on the borderline of unreasonable delay.  Where cases
    are approaching or are at the unreasonable delay limit, it is important that
    trial judges balance the factors that the trial judge ignored in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    allegation was a very serious one and the public had a keen interest in a
    trial on the merits.  This public interest should have been explicitly taken
    into account by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the accused suffered the same prejudice that all accused suffer when their
    case progresses slowly through the system, the appellant suffered no additional
    prejudice as a result of the delay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    regard to the absence of any prejudice, beyond that experienced by all accused,
    and the important public interest in a trial on the merits, we hold that
    the delay in this case, while far from ideal, was not unconstitutional.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is allowed, the stay entered by the trial judge is vacated, and the
    matter is remitted to the Superior Court for a trial. </p>
