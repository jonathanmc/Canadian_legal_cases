    appellant appeals his conviction for dangerous driving and his eighteen-
    month sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, who was driving his mother’s car, was signalled by a police car
    to stop.  Although the appellant saw the signal, he continued driving for
    some distance before finally stopping in a residential driveway.  The police
    officer approached the appellant’s car.  He held the appellant’s shoulders
    through the open car window and told him that he was under arrest.  The appellant
    put his car into gear and applied the accelerator, an act that knocked the
    police officer to the ground.  The appellant’s car ran over the police officer’s
    leg, causing ligament injuries that fortunately were not permanent.  The
    appellant parked the car a short distance away and fled into a marshy area.  He
    was apprehended with difficulty.  In the course of his apprehension, the
    appellant initially failed to respond to an order to put his hands in the
    air.  He also resisted arrest and attempted to grab the gun of one of the
    arresting officers from its holster.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of fail to stop, dangerous driving causing bodily
    harm, escape custody, flight from police officer, attempt to disarm officer
    and resist arrest.  He was sentenced to concurrent and consecutive sentences
    totalling eighteen months and three years of probation.  The trial judge
    also imposed a five-year driving prohibition and a three-year weapons prohibition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from the conviction for dangerous driving was concerned with the appellant’s
    intention in putting his car in gear and pressing the accelerator when he
    knew the police officer’s arm was in the car.  The appellant argues that
    the trial judge erred in finding this conduct was other than a panicked reflex
    reaction to his apprehension.  In concluding that the appellant’s conduct
    was intentional, the trial judge considered the appellant’s conduct in the
    context that the appellant acknowledged his initial failure to stop for the
    officer, he knew when he did stop that the officer was approaching his car
    to speak with him, he knew the officer’s arm was in the car and he knew that
    he was under arrest.  In these circumstances, the appellant’s response in
    accelerating the car could not be said to be either spontaneous or reflexive.  Rather,
    it was a considered response taken to avoid arrest.  We see no basis on which
    to interfere with the trial judge’s findings.  The appeal from conviction
    is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also appeals his combined sentence of eighteen months imprisonment
    for these offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that, although serious, these offences were at the lower
    end of the spectrum for this type of offence because the appellant was driving
    at a low rate of speed when first signalled to stop by the officer and thereafter
    and the appellant did stop, albeit after a delay.  The appellant also argues
    that his subsequent conduct was effectively a continuation of his effort
    to avoid the police, although admittedly exacerbated by his conduct in the
    marshy field.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, these offences were extremely serious.  They involved putting more
    than one police officer at risk.  The trial judge made no error in considering
    the vulnerability of police officers placed in a potentially dangerous situation
    and the importance of general deterrence.  Accordingly, in our view, it was
    within the discretion of the trial judge to impose significant sentences
    for these offences.  Moreover, in our view the total sentence of 18 months,
    viewed in isolation, is not outside the range for offences of this nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    we would interfere with the sentence for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in our view, the trial judge focussed excessively on the principles of general
    deterrence and denunciation and failed to give adequate weight to the principle
    that the primary objectives in sentencing a youthful first offender are individual
    deterrence and rehabilitation.  In this case the appellant’s individual circumstances
    presented a combination of both usual and unusual factors.  The appellant’s
    prospects for rehabilitation were very positive.  The trial judge remarked
    that specific deterrence was not an issue for this offender, for whom this
    conduct was completely out of character.  During his childhood, the appellant
    experienced significant and prolonged abuse from a step-father.  This abuse
    left him with a stutter so significant that his ability to communicate was
    impaired to the extent that, apart from family members, he often resorted
    to written communication or required a person to interpret for him.  The
    appellant’s communication problems would substantially increase his difficulties
    in serving a sentence in a prison setting.  The pre-sentence report was extremely
    positive.  It addressed the appellant’s disabilities and found they explained
    to some extent his aberrant behaviour on the night in question.  Finally,
    this young man acts virtually as a parent to his disabled mother who is dependent
    upon him for her day to day needs including her meal preparation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge did not provide sufficient reason for rejecting the imposition
    of a conditional sentence on at least some of the convictions.  He alluded
    to this possibility in regard to the “flight from police” charge, but simply
    observed it was “part of a package” that “should be weighed in with the others”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    it is not in the interests of justice that the appellant be reincarcerated
    at this time.  The appellant served just less than three months in prison
    before being released on a consent bail.  While on bail, he has seen a psychiatrist
    and speech therapist, with positive results.  He has completed a program
    at
    <st1:place

    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sanford
    <st1:PlaceName

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Academy, and is now employed on a full-time basis.  All these steps reinforce
    the positive prospects for the appellant’s rehabilitation, which would be
    placed at risk if he were reincarcerated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    considerations lead us to allow the appeal and substitute a sentence of three
    months imprisonment for flight from police, followed by a conditional sentence
    of twelve months for the remaining offences, broken down as follows: three
    months concurrent for fail to stop; three months concurrent for escape custody;
    six months consecutive for dangerous driving; six months consecutive for
    attempt to disarm police and four months concurrent for resist arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant’s aboriginal
    status in his reasons for sentence.  The presentence report stated that the
    appellant “had recently had contact with his birth father who advised he
    is to be getting his full Native status as a Micmac”.  The failure to consider
    the appellant’s aboriginal status and to give effect to s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is an error in principle.  However we say no more about it as this
    error was not raised as a ground of appeal, counsel neither requested nor
    suggested a Gladue report be obtained, and we impose a conditional sentence
    in any event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the usual terms for a conditional sentence, the appellant will
    abstain from alcohol and drugs (apart from over-the-counter and prescription
    medication).  He will continue treatment for his speech impediment and any
    other treatment or counselling as directed by his supervisor.  For the first
    nine months of the conditional portion of his sentence, he will remain at
    his residence at all times, except in the case of attending school or employment,
    appointments at court or with his physician or legal counsel, hospitalization,
    emergencies, grocery shopping on Saturdays between the hours of 2 p.m. and
    4 p.m.; and as permitted in writing by his supervisor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject
    to the same exceptions, the appellant will remain in his residence between
    the hours of 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for the remaining three months of his
    conditional sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of the conditional sentence, residence includes facilities within
    the appellant’s apartment building. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not interfere with the terms of probation or the driving and weapons
    prohibitions imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the conviction appeal is dismissed, leave to appeal sentence
    is granted and the sentence is varied so that the twelve-month balance of
    the appellant’s sentence will be a conditional sentence on the terms set
    out in these reasons. </p>
