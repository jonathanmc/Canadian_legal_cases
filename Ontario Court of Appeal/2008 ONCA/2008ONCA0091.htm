  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was convicted of sexual assault after a trial that took place
    on several days over a span of about one year (May 2005  May 2006).  He
    was sentenced in September 2006 to a term of two years less a day to be served
    in the community to be followed by a six-month probation term.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence arguing that despite the respondents
    youth, positive background, supportive family, and strong rehabilitative
    potential, the circumstances of this crime demanded a significant period
    of incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the Crowns submission.  The non-custodial sanction imposed at
    trial failed to reflect the seriousness of this crime and failed to adequately
    express societys denunciation of the respondents brutal and callous conduct.  A
    significant custodial sentence was the only appropriate sentence in the circumstances
    of this case.  Having regard to the respondents positive antecedents, and
    his successful completion of sixteen months of the conditional sentence imposed
    at trial, I would allow the appeal and impose a custodial sentence of nine
    months to be followed by probation for six months on the terms imposed by
    the trial judge.  </p>

  <h4>THE FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 19, 2003, the respondent, who was nineteen years old, asked S.T.,
    the complainant, and her friend if they wanted to skip school and go drinking.  The
    respondent knew both girls.  S.T., who was fourteen years old, and her friend
    accepted the respondents invitation.  The respondent and the two young girls
    walked to a car owned by the respondents friend.  That friend and another
    young man were at the car.  The three young men and two girls drove away
    in search of liquor. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent purchased some vodka for the group.  They drove to a park, left
    the vehicle and walked into a wooded area.  S.T. was drinking heavily.  She
    and the respondent kissed and hugged.  S.T. became very drunk and passed
    out while sitting in the woods.  Eventually, the respondent and his two friends
    carried S.T. back to the car.  She seemed unconscious and was dead weight
    in the arms of the three young men.  They put S.T. in the back seat of the
    vehicle between the respondent and one of his friends.  S.T.s girlfriend
    and the driver sat in the front seat.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the five persons were in the vehicle, the respondent put a jacket up as a
    curtain between the front and back seats.  The respondent proceeded to rape
    S.T., entering her vagina from behind.  The car rocked back and forth during
    the sexual attack.  S.T. was unconscious throughout the assault.  The respondent
    did not use a condom.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some
    time after the respondent raped S.T., her girlfriend got out of the car a
    short distance from her home.  S.T. was still unconscious in the back seat
    of the vehicle.  The respondent and his two friends did not want to take
    S.T. home in that condition so they decided to take her to a nearby schoolyard.  The
    respondent called S.T.s brother and told him that he had found S.T. drunk
    and passed out in the schoolyard.  He asked the brother to come and get S.T.  The
    respondent and his two friends carried S.T. out of the car at the school
    and dumped her into a snow bank under a tree.  She was only partially clad.  It
    was dark and very cold.  The respondent and his two friends returned to the
    warmth of their vehicle to await the arrival of S.T.s brother.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.T.s
    brother arrived at the school to find his sister unconscious and face down
    in the snow.  She was drooling and unresponsive.  The respondent and one
    of his friends carried S.T. to her brothers car.  They drove to S.T.s home
    and took her inside.  S.T. was still unresponsive.  Her brother called 911
    and the respondent and his friends left.  Before leaving S.T.s home, the
    respondent lied to her brother about what had happened to S.T. and tried
    to persuade the brother that S.T. did not need medical attention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    firefighters who responded to the 911 call could not get any response from
    S.T.  They rushed her to the hospital.  When S.T. was examined in the emergency
    unit at the hospital, she was unable to speak, could barely open her eyes
    and had little control over her limbs.  S.T. registered 9 out of 15 on the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Glasgow coma scale.  Had she scored any lower, she would have been classified
    as comatose.  According to the treating physician, S.T. was one small step
    away from requiring life support.  Blood samples collected after S.T. arrived
    at the hospital indicated that her blood/alcohol level earlier in the day
    had been in excess of .252 g, more than three times the legal limit.  S.T.
    was also suffering from hypothermia.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.T.s
    gynaecological examination revealed a band of bruising on the top of the
    cervix.  The bruising was consistent with a traumatic or very rough, forceful
    penetration of the vagina by an erect penis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> S.T.
    recovered from her physical injuries.  She remains traumatized by the rape,
    although she has come to forgive the respondent.  S.T. candidly acknowledges
    that she made some poor choices on that day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like
    the respondent, S.T. is of Tamil descent.  In the Tamil culture, female victims
    of sexual assault are sometimes stigmatized as unclean and unworthy of marriage
    in the Tamil community.  The respondent appreciated how his community could
    react to the female victim of a sexual assault.  S.T. has suffered some degree
    of stigmatization within her community.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h4>THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent elected trial in the Ontario Court of Justice and pled not guilty.  He
    testified that S.T. consented to having sexual intercourse with him in the
    back seat of the crowded vehicle.  Counsel for the respondent also advanced
    the alternative defence of an honest, but mistaken belief in consent. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that S.T. was so drunk that she lacked the capacity
    to consent to sexual activity.  The trial judge observed that even on the
    respondents evidence, S.T. was at best, semi-conscious.  The trial judge
    further held that any belief the respondent may have had as to S.T.s consent
    to sexual intercourse was
    completely unreasonable given her semi-conscious or unconscious state.  Although
    the reasons are not entirely clear, I read the trial judge as ultimately
    concluding that on the evidence, the respondents suggestion of an honest
    belief in consent had no air of reality.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing proceedings took place intermittently over about four months.  The
    Crown asked for a sentence of two and half years.  Counsel for the respondent
    submitted that a conditional sentence in the range of twelve months was appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons for sentence, the trial judge began by observing that this court
    had recognized a wide range of sentencing in sexual assault cases.  He indicated
    that although penitentiary terms could be warranted in some cases, a sentence
    of less than two years was appropriate here.  The trial judge went on to
    hold that the criteria for the imposition of a conditional sentence under
    s. 742.1 were met and that he proposed to permit the respondent to serve
    his sentence of two years less a day in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge characterized the sexual assault as very serious and arising
    out of an ill-conceived drinking event that got out of hand.  The trial
    judge recognized that considerable force was used in the sexual attack and
    that the respondent did not wear a condom.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge listed many of the aggravating factors, including:</p>

    background.  He was nineteen at the time of the offence and twenty-two at
    the time of sentencing.  The respondent had no prior involvement with the
    criminal justice system.  He had the support of a strong, close-knit family.  That
    family had stringently enforced the respondents strict bail conditions during
    the almost three years that he was on bail.  While on bail, the respondent
    spent almost all of his time working or going to school. The respondents
    father required him to turn his salary over to his father.  </p>

    he had been under since his arrest and release on bail.  The trial judge
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Finally, sir,

    house arrest for the first nine months of the sentence.  The respondent was
    allowed to leave his home with his parents, for school attendance, employment,

    the curfew, he was required to be in his home between midnight and 6:00 a.m.
    unless with his parents or for a medical emergency, attending school, or
    for purposes of his employment.  During the last six months of the conditional

    criminal justice systems seek to achieve justice in sentencing by the extensive
    use of mandatory minimum sentences coupled with tightly calculated sentencing
    grids that all but dictate the sentence to be imposed by the trial judge
    in any given case.  Historically, Canadian criminal law has taken a very
    different road to justice in sentencing.  For the vast majority of offences,
    Parliament provides no minimum sentence and a broad spectrum of potential
    dispositions.  Trial judges are given a very wide discretion to determine
    the appropriate disposition in each case.  In exercising that discretion,
    Parliament provides guidance by way of the broadly worded objectives and
    principles in Part XXIII of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Trial judges must
    apply those objectives and principles to the specifics of each case and,
    in the exercise of their discretion, fashion a sentence that is tailored
    to the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    individualization of the sentencing process through the judicial exercise

    Lamer C.J.C. described the central role of the trial judge in the sentencing
    process:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no easy
    test or formula that the judge can apply in weighing these factors.  Much
    will depend on the good judgment and wisdom of sentencing judges, whom Parliament
    vested with considerable discretion in making these determinations </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sometimes competing principles that must be weighed by the trial judge in
    the exercise of his or her sentencing discretion can give rise to difficult
    problems for trial judges.  This trial judge was faced with just such a problem.  On
    the one hand, the circumstances of this offence cried out for a significant
    jail term.  On the other hand, the respondents personal circumstances strongly
    suggested that incarceration was unnecessary.  The trial judge tried to balance
    these competing concerns by imposing a conditional sentence with punitive
    terms that included partial house arrest and a curfew.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown acknowledges that this court must show deference to the trial judges
    choice of sentence.  Sentencing is a profoundly subjective process and
    the sentence ultimately imposed will reflect a multiplicity of considerations,
    some of which are beyond the reach of appellate review:  see <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995),
    102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at para. 46 (S.C.C.).  </p>

    appellate deference to the sentence imposed at trial also reflects the reality
    that in many cases there is no single correct sentence, but rather a range
    of appropriate sentences from which the trial judge must select one.  There
    is no reason to think that the appeal court is more likely to make a better
    selection from among the range of appropriate sentences than the trial judge.  Indeed,
    the trial judges position gives him or her certain advantages over the appeal
    court:  <i>R. v. M.(

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    the trial judges central role in the sentencing process, s. 687 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> does authorize sentence appeals.  Appellate intervention, where
    warranted, is part of the sentencing scheme fashioned by the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  An appellate court may vary a sentence imposed where the trial
    judge has erred in principle, failed to consider evidence relevant to sentence,
    misapprehended a material fact, or imposed a sentence that is demonstrably
    unfit:  <i>R. v. McDonnell</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 436 at paras. 15-16

    Crown argued that the trial judge made errors in principle and that the sentence
    was demonstrably unfit.  As I agree with the latter submission, I do not
    propose to address the alleged errors in principle.  A sentence is demonstrably
    unfit when it falls outside the range of sentences that could reasonably
    have been imposed in the circumstances.  This standard of review does not
    ask  does the sentence accord with the appeal courts opinion as to the
    appropriate sentence, but instead asks  is the sentence within the range
    of sentences that could reasonably be imposed in all the circumstances:  <i>McDonnell</i>, <i>supra</i>,

    question of whether the sentence imposed in this case is demonstrably unfit
    comes down to this  was a conditional sentence a clearly inappropriate disposition
    in the totality of the circumstances?  If it was not, this court must defer
    to the trial judges decision even though it might have imposed a different

    at paras. 46-47, the court identified three prerequisites for a conditional
    sentence:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

    court must conclude that a term of imprisonment of less than two years is
    an appropriate disposition; and</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first and third of these criteria are not in dispute.  Sexual assault does
    not carry a minimum period of incarceration and the Crown does not suggest
    that the safety of the community would be imperilled were the respondent
    to serve his sentence in the community.</p>

    remaining prerequisite, that the court impose a term of imprisonment of less
    than two years, is in issue in this case.  <i>Proulx</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 58 describes the approach to be taken to this criterion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'> [<u>T]he requirement
      that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two
      years can be fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate
      range of available sentences.</u>  Thus, the approach I suggest still requires
      the judge to proceed in two stages.  However, the judge need not impose
      a term of imprisonment of a <i>fixed</i> duration at the first stage of
      the analysis.  Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has to exclude two
      possibilities:  (a) probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term.  If
      either of these sentences is appropriate, then a conditional sentence should
      not be imposed.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]</p>

    was initially inclined to the position that a penitentiary term was required
    in all the circumstances of this case.  Upon further consideration, however,
    I have come to the view that a sentence of two years less a day is within,
    albeit barely, the appropriate range of sentence in all of the circumstances.  I
    have moved to that position because of the respondents age, his otherwise
    unblemished record, his strong rehabilitative potential, his familys support,
    and his compliance with strict bail conditions for almost three years prior
    to sentence:  see <i>R. v. Downes </i>(2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 321 at para. 33.  </p>

    determination that the three prerequisites for a conditional sentence have
    been met does not mean that a conditional sentence is an appropriate disposition.  A

    sentencing:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to

    speaking, sentences imposed on young first offenders will stress individual
    deterrence, where necessary, and rehabilitation.  General deterrence will
    play little, if any, role in fashioning the appropriate sentence in this
    category of offender in most cases:  <i> R. v. Ijam</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d)

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Serious crimes of violence, particularly sexual assaults, do provide
    an exception to the general rule described above.  While all of the principles
    of sentences remain important, including rehabilitation, for serious crimes
    involving significant personal violence, the objectives of denunciation and
    general deterrence gain prominence:  <i>R. v. Ijam</i>, <i>supra</i>;  <i>R.

    emphasis to be placed on denunciation and to a lesser extent general deterrence,
    grows with the seriousness of the particular circumstances surrounding the
    sexual assault for which an accused, even a young accused, is being sentenced.  As
    is hopefully clear from the recitation of the facts of this case, this was
    a very serious sexual assault.  I do not propose to repeat all of the aggravating
    factors.  I would, however, stress the following in the context of explaining
    the need for a strong denunciatory sentence:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    age and vulnerability of the victim;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    respondent committed this crime in the presence of other members of the victims
    peer group, no doubt adding to her long-term humiliation and the need for
    general deterrence:  see <i>R. v. Kennedy</i> (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 378
    at 386 (Ont. C.A.);</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    significant emotional harm done to the victim and potential long-term ostracization
    of the victim in her ethnic community, the risk of which was known to the
    respondent; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

    aggravating circumstances surrounding this offence were such that the fundamental
    purpose of sentencing could only be properly served by a disposition that
    placed a heavy emphasis on general deterrence and particularly denunciation.  I
    recognize that a conditional sentence can in some circumstances adequately
    address these objectives, particularly where the conditions imposed have
    a significant punitive element: <i>Proulx</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 41;  <i>R.
    v. Ijam</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 94.  However, there will be circumstances
    in which the demands of denunciation and/or general deterrence are so pressing
    that incarceration is the only suitable disposition:  <i>Proulx</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 106;  <i>Wells</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 34.; <i>R. v. Killam</i> (1999),

    am satisfied that the objectives of denunciation and to a lesser extent general
    deterrence required the incarceration of the respondent despite his many
    positive features.  Any other disposition would not only fail to reflect
    those objectives, but would, in my view, be disproportionate both to the
    gravity of the offence and the respondents degree of responsibility:  <i>Criminal
    Code</i> s. 718.1.  In coming to this conclusion, I recognize that incarceration,
    particularly for young first offenders, is a sanction of last resort:  s.

    the circumstances of this offence, the positive features of the respondent
    must be given less weight on sentencing than would be the case if the circumstances
    of the offence were not so egregious.  Nor do I think that the respondents emotional
    upset or his apparent awkwardness around girls can carry any weight in
    the determination of the appropriate sentence in these circumstances.  Finally,
    while I acknowledge the trial judges finding of remorse, the mitigating
    value of that remorse is lessened by its appearance only after conviction
    and before sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    determined that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit in all the circumstances,
    it falls to this court to impose a fit sentence.  In doing so, the reality
    of the present situation must be acknowledged.  The respondent has completed
    some sixteen months of his conditional sentence.  For the first nine of those
    sixteen months, his liberty was substantially restricted as he was under
    partial house arrest.  For the remaining seven months, the respondent has
    been held to a relatively strict curfew.  He has also completed his community
    service obligations.  There is also no doubt that sending the respondent
    to jail at this time, some sixteen months after he was sentenced, will impose
    a significant added hardship on him and his family.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time of sentence, but
    also to the circumstances as they exist now, some sixteen months post-sentence,
    I would vary the respondents sentence to one of nine months imprisonment
    to be followed by six months probation on the terms imposed by the trial
    judge.  </p>

    wish to emphasize, however, that while I am satisfied that nine months incarceration
    is an appropriate sentence at this time, it would not have been appropriate
    at the time of sentencing.  In my view, the appropriate range at the time
    of sentencing was between two years less a day and four years incarceration.  </p>

  <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal and vary the sentence
    to nine months imprisonment to be followed by probation for six months on
    the terms imposed by the trial judge.  A warrant may issue for the respondents
    arrest, if necessary, to secure his surrender into custody.</p>
