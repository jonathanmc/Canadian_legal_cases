  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spirent
    Communications of Ottawa Limited agreed to lease the majority of an
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa office building that was under construction.  Quake Technologies (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Inc. agreed with Spirent that it would sublease part of the building for
    three years.  June 1, 2001, was the specified occupancy date for both Spirent
    and Quake.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weather
    and construction mistakes led to delays in the construction of the building.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 2001, Quake learned that occupancy would be delayed until July 15,
    2001.  It advised Spirent that due to a number of shortcomings, including
    the failure to be able to deliver occupancy on June 1, 2001, it would not
    proceed with the sublease agreement.  Spirent disputed the alleged shortcomings
    and maintained that the subleased premises would be available on June 1,
    2001, as agreed.  Nonetheless, in May 2001, Quake subleased space elsewhere
    at a significantly lower cost.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spirent
    then purported to accept Quake’s “repudiation”
    of the sublease agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spirent
    was able to sublease the space to third parties but at a much-reduced rate.  It
    sued Quake for the difference between the amount it would have received under
    the sublease agreement and that which it was actually able to obtain.  Quake
    defended on the basis that Spirent’s breaches of the agreement entitled Quake
    to treat the agreement as at an end.  Quake also counterclaimed for the expenses
    it had incurred in reliance on the agreement and as a result of Spirent’s
    alleged breach, and for the return of the deposit that it made at the time
    the agreement was entered into.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    judgment dated June 28, 2006 (the “Judgment”), Panet J. dismissed the claim
    and gave judgment on the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spirent
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mid-2000, Spirent, a high technology company in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa, was looking for new space to occupy because its then-existing lease
    was to expire on May 31, 2001.  On August 23, 2000, Spirent signed a ten-year
    offer to lease the majority of the space in an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa office building that was being constructed by Palladium Development
    Corporation (“Palladium” or the
    “Landlord”).  The building had a scheduled completion date of April 30, 2001.  The
    lease was to begin on June 1, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quake
    was a growing high technology company in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  As a result of its growth and the approaching end of its existing
    lease, it too sought new business premises.  Quake’s then-existing lease
    was to expire on May 31, 2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an offer to sublease dated October 10, 2000, signed on October 26, 2000,
    Quake agreed with Spirent that it would sublease approximately 26,000 square
    feet of the Palladium building (the “Agreement”).  The term of the sublease
    was June 1, 2001, to May 31, 2004.  At the time the Agreement was entered
    into, there was a tremendous demand for space.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement also required that a written sublease agreement was to be finalized
    by November 22, 2000.  No such further agreement was ever signed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the winter of 2000-2001, there were delays in construction due to weather
    and construction mistakes.  Spirent was informed of these delays.  On February
    19, 2001, Spirent acknowledged to the Landlord that its occupancy date would
    be changed to June 22, 2001.  Quake was generally aware that there were construction
    delays but was not given specific information on that matter until March
    8, 2001.  On that date, representatives of Spirent and Quake met to discuss
    various issues relating to the subleased property including recycling, office
    cleaning, usable space, security and signage.  Also during this meeting,
    Spirent told Quake that Spirent anticipated taking occupancy on June 22,
    2001, and that Quake would have occupancy sometime after that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the spring of 2001, as a result of the decline of the high technology sector,
    the commercial leasing market in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa had changed dramatically and, as compared to the fall of 2000, more
    space was available and rental rates had gone down significantly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 9, 2001, Quake was advised by its project manager that the building’s
    general contractor believed that July 15, 2001 was an achievable occupancy
    date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quake
    sent Spirent a letter dated April 19, 2001, stating that it would not proceed
    with the Agreement (the “April 19<sup>th</sup> letter”) because of “a cumulative
    number of shortcomings”, including Spirent’s failure to be able to deliver
    the premises by June 1, 2001.  The April 19<sup>th</sup> letter also stated
    that Quake had attempted to negotiate a short term lease with its existing
    landlord and that it could stay on for an additional three months, albeit
    at a higher cost.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    receipt of the April 19, 2001 letter, Spirent sent Quake a letter dated April
    25, 2001, in which it stated that the alleged shortcomings were without foundation,
    the subleased premises would be delivered on June 1, 2001, and it intended
    to hold Quake to the terms of the sublease.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 15, 2001, Quake entered into a sublease with a third party.  The new
    sublease provided that Quake would pay rent in the amount of $15.50 per square
    foot for the first two years and then $16.50 per square foot for the following
    three years - rent which was substantially lower than the $20.50 per square
    foot that Quake was to pay under the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 15, 2001, Quake also wrote to Spirent stating
    “Spirent committed a fundamental breach of this Offer to Sublease, and, accordingly,
    Quake has no further obligations under the Offer to Sublease …”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 17, 2001, Spirent advised Quake that it was treating Quake’s actions
    as a repudiation of the Agreement and that Quake’s deposit was forfeited.  Spirent
    then brought a claim, based on Quake’s alleged repudiation of the Agreement,
    to recover $1,096,793.87, which was the difference between the amount it
    was entitled to under the Agreement and the income Spirent obtained by subleasing
    the space to third parties.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quake
    defended on the basis that by April 19, 2001, it had become apparent that
    Spirent was unable to deliver the sublease premises on the occupancy date
    and that Spirent was in breach of its obligations under the Agreement.  Quake
    also counterclaimed for expenses incurred in reliance on the Agreement and
    as a result of Spirent’s alleged breach of the Agreement ($121,977.42), and
    for the return of its deposit ($133,250.00).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE TRIAL DECISION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge first determined that, pursuant to the Agreement, Quake had the
    right to complete its tenant fit-ups prior to June 1, 2001, so that it would
    be able to take over the premises and “be up and running” by that date.  To
    accomplish that, the Landlord’s base building and the demised premises with
    the suite entry doors were to be provided to Quake prior to June 1, 2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    the trial judge held that there had been an anticipatory breach and repudiation
    of the Agreement by Spirent as of April 19, 2001.  This conclusion was based
    on his finding that, in early April 2001, the general contractor advised
    Quake that July 15, 2001, was “achievable for occupancy”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered whether on June 1, 2001, Spirent met its obligations
    under the Agreement.  He found that the building was not substantially complete
    by that date and that the delays in construction were not due to Quake.  Consequently,
    he held that Spirent failed to meet its obligations under the Agreement to
    provide Quake with occupancy on June 1, 2001.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also found that at April 19, 2001, Spirent was in breach of its
    obligation under the Agreement to deliver a draft sublease (as opposed to
    an offer to sublease) to Quake by November 22, 2000, or a reasonable period
    thereafter.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    the circumstances, the trial judge stated, it was reasonable for Quake to
    conclude that the date of July 15, 2001, although expressed as being “achievable
    for occupancy” was not a fixed date and further slippage or delay was possible.  He
    concluded that, as a result of the delay in occupancy of six weeks and possibly
    longer, “Spirent was in breach of a stipulation of major importance to the
    contract”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the trial judge quoted the following passage from this court’s judgment in <i>1193430
    Ontario Inc. v. Boa-Franc Inc. </i>(2006), 78 O. R. (3d) 81 at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The test for determining
    whether a breach amounts to a fundamental breach that deprives the innocent
    party of “substantially the whole benefit of the contract” was recently restated
    by this court in <i>Shelanu Inc. v. Print 3 Franchising Corp. </i>(2003),
    64 O.R. (3d) 533 (C.A.).  In that case, the court adopted the application
    of five factors extrapolated by Professor Waddams from the case law to analyze
    whether there has been a substantial failure of performance amounting to
    a fundamental breach.  They are:  (1) the ratio of the party’s obligations
    not performed to the obligation as a whole; (2) the seriousness of the breach
    to the innocent party; (3) the likelihood of repetition of such breach; (4)
    the seriousness of the consequences of the breach; and (5) the relationship
    of the part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the anticipated delay in occupancy was a fundamental
    breach by Spirent and that the consequences of the breach to Quake were “material”.  He
    then held that since Spirent was “in a position of anticipatory and fundamental
    breach of its obligations”, Quake was entitled to treat the Agreement as
    at an end.  Accordingly, he dismissed Spirent’s claim.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was satisfied that the costs claimed by Quake as a result of
    Spirent’s failure to meet its obligations were properly incurred.  Thus,
    he gave judgment on the counterclaim.     </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    critical issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in holding
    that, on April 19, 2001, Quake was entitled to treat the Agreement as at
    an end.  In my view, he did so err.    <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I explain more fully below, although the trial judge correctly stated that
    a fundamental breach is one that deprives the innocent party of substantially
    the whole benefit of the contract, he failed to measure Spirent’s breach
    against that standard.  Indeed, even on the finding of the trial judge, the
    breach did not reach that level.  Further, the trial judge identified the
    five factors that this court has indicated should be considered when determining
    whether a fundamental breach has occurred but he failed to consider those
    factors.  A consideration of those factors shows that the anticipated delay
    in occupancy would not have deprived Quake of substantially the whole benefit
    of the contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    this juncture, a preliminary point needs to be made.  It is not entirely
    clear why the trial judge held that Spirent was in fundamental breach of
    its obligations on April 19, 2001.  On the most obvious reading of the reasons,
    the trial judge held that the anticipated delay in occupancy was the fundamental
    breach that gave Quake the right to treat the Agreement as terminated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    another reading – that urged by Quake - the trial judge’s finding of a fundamental
    breach is based on a combination of the anticipated delay in occupancy and
    Spirent’s failure to provide Quake with a written sublease agreement.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following analysis will focus on the anticipated delay in occupancy, as it
    is the foundation for the trial judge’s determination that Spirent had committed
    a fundamental breach.  Later in my reasons, I discuss the effect of the additional
    breach, namely Spirent’s failure to provide Quake with a final sublease agreement.  </p>

    the trial judge correctly stated: (1) only a fundamental breach by Spirent
    would have given Quake the right to treat the Agreement as at an end; and,
    (2) a fundamental breach is one which deprives the innocent party of substantially
    the whole benefit of the contract.  See, among other cases, <i>Place Concorde

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge also correctly noted, this court has repeatedly stated that
    there are five factors that can be considered when determining whether conduct
    has deprived the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the
    contract.  The five factors are: (1) the ratio of the party’s obligations
    not performed to that party’s obligations as a whole; (2) the seriousness
    of the breach to the innocent party; (3) the likelihood of repetition of
    such breach; (4) the seriousness of the consequences of the breach; and (5)
    the relationship of the part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation.  See <i>Place
    Concorde, supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add this.  When considering Spirent’s conduct, it was important to
    keep in mind that what was involved was an anticipatory breach of contract.  An
    anticipatory breach sufficient to justify the termination of a contract occurs
    when one party, whether by express language or conduct, repudiates the contract
    or evinces an intention not to be bound by the contract before performance
    is due.  See <i>Pompeani v. Bonik Inc. </i>(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 417 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  To assess whether the party in breach has evinced such an intention,
    the court is to ask whether a reasonable person would conclude that the breaching
    party no longer intends to be bound by it.  See <i>McCallum et al. v. Zivojinovic </i>(1977),
    16 O.R. (2d) 721 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Having said that, when determining whether such an intention has been
    evinced, the courts rely on much the same analysis as they do in respect
    of claims of fundamental breach.  That is, in determining whether the party
    in breach had repudiated or shown an intention not to be bound by the contract
    before performance is due, the court asks whether the breach deprives the
    innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><i>Did the anticipated
        delay in occupancy deprive Quake of substantially the whole benefit of
        the Agreement?</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the anticipated delay in occupancy amounted to
    a fundamental breach because the consequences to Quake were “material”.  However,
    as explained above, the legal standard against which the breach is to be
    measured is not whether the consequences of the breach are material – there
    are many breaches that are material but are nonetheless compensable in damages – but,
    rather, whether the anticipated delay in occupancy would deprive Quake of
    substantially the whole benefit of the contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a breach which has “material” consequences does not rise to the
    level of one that has deprived the innocent party of substantially the whole
    benefit of the contract.  Thus, even on the finding of the trial judge, the
    anticipated delay did not constitute a fundamental breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quake
    argues that the anticipated delay was of fundamental importance to it because
    the consequence of not taking occupancy on June 1, 2001, was that it would
    have been “out on the street”.  I do not accept this submission for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the record does not support Quake’s contention.  There was no evidence at
    trial that Quake made any efforts to obtain more “swing space” before it
    made its decision to terminate the Agreement.  In fact, the evidence is to
    the contrary.  In the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter, Quake stated that its
    existing landlord was willing to provide it with a three-month extension.  The
    relevant part of the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[O]ur business plan calls
    for the accelerated hiring bring [sic] headcount to 59 by June 1, 2001, and
    73 by August 1, 2001 and in our current space there is no more room for them
    to work – we need the sublease space for June 1, 2001 to have those people
    working to meet out deadlines[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>We have tried to negotiate
    a short term lease with the current landlord and they will allow us to stay
    for three extra months in exchange for paying for seven months rent –
    given the current financing environment it’s an inefficient use of our resources
    to be spending it on rent at more than twice the market rate, furthermore,
    the space is inadequate to meet our needs[.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    its own admission, therefore, although Quake would have incurred additional
    costs by maintaining its then-existing lease, it would have had space for
    at least three months after June 1, 2001.  Had it elected to stay in its
    then-existing space, it would have been entitled to look to Spirent for compensation
    for those additional costs.  See <i>Procopio v. D’Abbondanza et al. </i>(1975),
    8 O.R. (2d) 496 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognise that the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter suggests that the inadequacy
    of Quake’s then-existing space made an extension of its lease unworkable.  However,
    the record shows that on April 19, 2001, Quake signed a terms sheet with
    investors for US$30 million.  It then sent Spirent the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter
    and contacted a real estate agent to find alternative space.  It was not
    until after it received the US$30 million investment in May 2001 that Quake
    revised its business plan and accelerated its rate of hiring.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the record shows that Quake did not apply for a building permit until March
    2001.  While this timing may be explained by other delays, if the June 1,
    2001, occupancy date was of such importance to Quake, one would have thought
    Quake would have applied for its building permit well before March 2001.  Further,
    one would have thought that at the meeting on March 8<sup>th</sup>, when
    told of the anticipated delay to June 22, Quake would have protested or,
    at a minimum, reiterated the importance of the June 1<sup>st</sup> occupancy
    date.  However, there is no evidence that was done at the meeting or at any
    point thereafter prior to the sending of the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter.  Moreover,
    while Spirent did not inform Quake of the delay until the meeting on March
    8, 2001, Quake was aware of that possibility as early as January 2001 and
    had been told in November 2000 that June was a “difficult time frame”.  In
    the circumstances, it is telling that Quake never directly asked Spirent
    about the extent of any possible delay.  All of these matters speak to the
    seriousness of the breach and its consequences to Quake.  They do not support
    a conclusion that the possible delay in occupancy was so serious that it
    gave Quake the legal right to treat the Agreement as terminated.  </p>

        Factors</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge appears to have focussed on the fourth factor – the seriousness
    of the breach to the innocent party.  For the reasons already given, I do
    not accept that the anticipated delay in occupancy had sufficiently serious
    consequences to Quake that it would have deprived Quake of substantially
    the whole benefit of the Agreement.  This conclusion is reinforced by considering
    the first and fifth factors, that is, by considering the breach in the context
    of Spirent’s overall obligation under the Agreement.  Spirent’s obligation
    under the Agreement was to provide Quake with occupancy by June 1, 2001.  Quake’s
    occupancy was to last for 3 years.  In the circumstances, a delay in occupancy
    of six weeks is not so significant that it amounts to deprivation of substantially
    the whole benefit of the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'><b><i>Did Spirent evince an intention not to be bound by the Agreement?</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would
    a reasonable person conclude that Spirent evinced an intention to no longer
    be bound by the provisions of the Agreement?  No.  To conclude otherwise
    would be to fail to recognise that the anticipated delay in occupancy was
    the result not of Spirent’s actions but, rather, of the weather and mistakes
    of third parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, the record demonstrates that Spirent very much wanted the Agreement
    to continue.  Like Quake, Spirent needed to take occupancy of the premises
    on June 1, 2001.   Further, given the change in the rental market, Spirent
    clearly had a financial incentive to keep the Agreement afoot.  And, the
    correspondence between Spirent and Quake demonstrate that Spirent was working
    to complete its obligations under the Agreement.  For example, Quake’s notes
    of the meeting of March 8, 2001, show that Spirent was working with Quake
    to meet Quake’s demands.  The evidence also shows that, beginning on the
    day immediately following that meeting, Spirent took steps to further respond
    to those demands.  Even after Spirent received the April 19<sup>th</sup> letter
    from Quake, it continued to attempt to meet Quake’s concerns and work with
    it to minimise anticipated delays in occupancy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, Spirent gave no indication, by conduct or language, that it wanted
    to repudiate the Agreement or that it did not intend to be bound by its provisions.  On
    the contrary, the record shows that until its May 17, 2001 letter, when Spirent
    accepted Quake’s repudiation, Spirent intended to fulfill its contractual
    obligations.    <b><i></i></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    previously mentioned, Quake argues that the trial judge relied on Spirent’s
    failure to provide it with a final sublease agreement when concluding that
    Spirent was in fundamental breach of the Agreement on April 19, 2001.  In
    making this argument, Quake relies on para. 68 of the reasons, where the
    trial judge states, “this breach by Spirent was an added factor in the consideration
    by Quake that there had been a fundamental breach.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    earlier in para. 68 the trial judge states,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I conclude that the failure
    by Spirent to deliver the Lease did not constitute a fundamental breach of
    its obligations under the Offer to Sub-Lease.  All material provisions with
    respect to the agreement to lease the premises as between Spirent and Quake
    were contained in the Offer to Sub-Lease, and both parties treated the Offer
    to Sub-Lease as a binding agreement between them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is, the trial judge held that the failure to provide the final sublease was
    not a fundamental breach.  I agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, the anticipated delay in occupancy was not a fundamental
    breach.  The failure to deliver the final sublease was a far more minor breach.  Suffice
    to say that the two, in combination, did not deprive Quake of substantially
    the whole benefit of the Agreement.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b><i>The Effect
        of Repudiation by Quake</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Repudiation
    does not automatically bring a contract to an end.  Rather, it gives the
    innocent party the right to elect to treat the contract as at an end.  If
    that election is made, the parties are relieved from further performance
    and the innocent party may sue for damages.  As a general rule, the innocent
    party must make the election and communicate it to the repudiating party
    within a reasonable time.  See <i>Place Concorde, supra </i>at 155.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, on April 19, 2001, Quake was not entitled to terminate
    the Agreement or to treat it as at an end.  Consequently, its letter of April
    19, 2001, amounted to repudiation of the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    unsuccessfully attempting to resolve things with Quake, Spirent accepted
    Quake’s repudiation and communicated that acceptance by means of its letter
    to Quake dated May 17, 2001.  Consequently, Spirent was relieved of its obligations
    under the Agreement.  Thus, the trial judge’s alternate determination that
    Spirent was in fundamental breach of its obligations on June 1, 2001, because
    the building was not substantially complete on that date, cannot stand.  By
    June 1, 2001, Quake had repudiated the Agreement and Spirent had accepted
    that repudiation with the result that the Agreement was ended.  Spirent could
    not be found to be in fundamental breach of an Agreement that was no longer
    in existence.      </p>

    figure of $1,096,793.87 was put forward by Spirent and not challenged by
    Quake on the appeal.  Further, it accords with the figures of the trial judge
    in paras. 18 and 19 of the reasons.  In those paragraphs, the trial judge
    states that Quake’s obligation under the Agreement was $2,669,940 and Spirent
    mitigated to the extent of $1,644,899.  This left a loss of $1,025,041<a
