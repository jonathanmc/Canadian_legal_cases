    appeal raises two issues. The first relates to the scope of the exclusion
    clause and the motion judge’s determination that it did not absolve the appellant
    insurer from its duty to defend the respondent insured against the plaintiff’s
    claim for bodily injury arising from his exposure to mould and/or bacteria.
    The second relates to the motion judge’s determination that the insured could
    require the insurer to retain counsel of the insured’s choice.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.           Scope
      of the Exclusion Clause</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the first issue, the insurer relies on clause 7 of the policy under the heading “Common
    Exclusions”. Clause 7 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This insurance
    does not apply to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    other costs, loss or expense incurred by others, arising directly or indirectly,
    from the actual, <i>alleged</i> or threatened inhalation of, ingestion of,
    contact with, exposure to, existence of, presence of, spread of, reproduction,
    discharge or other growth of any “fungi” or
    “spores” however caused, including any costs or expenses incurred to prevent,
    respond to, test for, monitor, abate, mitigate, remove, cleanup, contain,
    remediate, treat, detoxify, neutralize, assess or otherwise deal with or
    dispose of
    “fungi” or “spores”; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    obligation to pay damages, share damages with or repay someone else who must
    pay damages because of such injury or damage referred to in (a) or (b) above.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><i>This exclusion applies regardless of the cause of the loss or damage,
      other causes of the injury, damage, expense or costs or whether other causes
      acted concurrently or in any sequence to produce the injury, damage, expenses
      or costs.</i> [This is the referred to as a concurrent exclusion clause.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For the purpose
    of this exclusion, the following definitions are added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“Fungi”
    includes, but is not limited to, any form or type of mould, yeast, mushroom
      or mildew whether or not allergenic, pathogenic or toxigenic, and any substance,
      vapour or gas produced by, emitted from or arising out of any “Fungi” or
    “Spores” or resultant mycotoxins, allergens, or pathogens.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“Spores”
    Includes, but is not limited to, any reproductive particle or microscopic
      fragment produced by, emitted from or arising out of any “fungi”. [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that this exclusion, including the “concurrent exclusion” clause,
    did not absolve the insurer of its duty to defend because the plaintiff had
    pleaded that his injuries arose from mould and bacteria and if it were found
    that the injuries were due solely to bacteria (a non-excluded peril), the
    exclusion clause would not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the insurer argued that the motion judge failed to consider the effect
    of the word “alleged” within s. 7(a) of the exclusion. According to the insurer,
    the effect of that language was to absolve the insurer of a duty to defend
    in any case where bodily injury from mould is alleged, even if combined with
    other causes of bodily injury, such as bacteria. The insurer further submitted
    that the effect of the clause is that the duty to defend is narrower than
    the duty to indemnify. In this regard, the insurer submitted that if, after
    a trial, it were found that the injury was caused solely by bacteria, the
    insurer would have a duty to indemnify the insured, even though it had not
    been obliged to defend the action on the insured’s behalf.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree with the insurer’s position. The language in clause 7(a) is both
    unclear and ambiguous in its effect. A plain reading of the provision does
    not support the insurer’s position. Indeed, the clause is worded in a fashion
    that would leave most people guessing as to its meaning. For example, on
    another possible interpretation, the clause could be taken to mean that wherever
    injury from mould is alleged in a claim, even if it is ultimately established
    that the injury arose solely from a covered peril, such as bacteria, the
    claim would exclude both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify. This
    would effectively extend the exclusion to otherwise non-excluded perils.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurer’s position stands on its head the general proposition that the duty
    to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. (See <i>Nichols v. American
    Home Assurance Co.,</i> [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801 at para. 17). If, as the insurer
    submits<b>, </b>the clause was meant to convey that the insurer’s duty to
    defend is narrower than its duty to indemnify, clear and unambiguous language
    was required. The language used falls well short of the mark.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we agree with the conclusion of the motion judge that the insurer has the
    duty to defend this claim.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.           Choice
      of Counsel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that the insurer had a duty to defend its insured, the motion judge
    then had to determine whether the insured was required to accept the insurer’s
    choice of counsel. The insurance policy provides that the insurer has “the
    right and duty to defend any action” that seeks damages covered by the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insured is concerned that because of the coverage issue, counsel appointed
    by the insurer might tend to “steer” the conduct of the case to an outcome
    that would not require indemnity because of the concurrent exclusion clause.
    That clause would exclude indemnity for any bodily injury caused, even in
    part, by mould. The insurer expressed a similar concern about using counsel
    for the insured. It would be in the insured’s interest to defend on the basis
    that if it was liable to the plaintiff for bodily injury, that injury was
    caused solely by bacteria and not by mould, and therefore the injury would
    not be an excluded peril for indemnity under the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to meet these concerns, the insurer proposed a set of safeguards to
    keep its trial counsel separate from its coverage claims representative.
    According to the insurer, these safeguards would alleviate any concern about
    conflict, real or apprehended.  The motion judge did not accept the insurer’s
    proposal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge referred to the principle that an insurer’s right to control
    the defence of the action is not absolute:
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <i>Brockton</i><i> (Municipality) v. Frank Cowan Co.</i> (2002), 57 O.R.
    (3d) 447 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). He rejected the proposed safeguards as impractical and ineffective. In
    view of the insurer’s initial refusal to defend the plaintiff’s action – which
    prompted Appin’s application to compel the insurer to defend – and in view
    of the ongoing coverage dispute, the motion judge concluded that a reasonable
    person would still perceive a conflict despite the proposed safeguards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that the insured’s counsel, Mr. Cavanagh, a competent
    and experienced insurance counsel, should be retained by the insurer to defend
    the action at the insurer’s expense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, counsel for the insurer suggested that in order to meet the
    mutual concerns expressed by both sides, a third approach would be for the
    parties to agree on an independent counsel to defend the plaintiff’s claim
    on behalf of the insured and pursuant to the insurer’s duty to defend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  We
    understand the concern expressed by the trial judge, shared by counsel on
    appeal, that any counsel who acts for the defendant will necessarily be aware
    of the coverage issue and that he or she will be faced with the difficulty
    of ensuring a fair approach to the defence of the claim that does not “steer” the
    defence toward or against coverage.  Recognizing this challenge, Mr. Cavanaugh
    remains prepared to act. On this record, we are satisfied that the solution
    reached by the trial judge was appropriate and one he was entitled to make
    in the exercise of his discretion. We see no basis for interfering with it.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>RESULT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:13.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the insurer’s appeal is dismissed. As agreed by the parties, the respondent
    shall have its costs of the appeal on a substantial indemnity basis fixed
    at $9,117.76, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
