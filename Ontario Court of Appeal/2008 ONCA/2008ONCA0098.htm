    appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to a year in secure
    custody.  He appeals conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    complainant and the appellant were casual friends and rented apartments in
    the same house. On the day of the alleged offence, the appellant helped the
    complainant get into her apartment when she was unable to unlock her door.  The
    complainant alleged that shortly after doing so, the appellant followed her
    into her bedroom and raped her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified and agreed that he helped the complainant get into her
    apartment.  He testified that the sexual intercourse was consensual and that
    it ended when the complainant told him she had had sex with her ex-boyfriend
    earlier that day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    outcome of the trial turned primarily on the trial judge’s assessment of
    the evidence of the appellant and the complainant and his application of
    the burden of proof.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave lengthy reasons for judgment in which he quoted extensively
    from a transcript of the evidence.  He concluded that the complainant was
    credible on the essential parts of her evidence and that the appellant was
    a liar.  The trial judge gave many reasons for his credibility assessments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons for judgment demonstrate a detailed review of the evidence. 
    They also reveal a strained and artificial examination of the evidence of
    both the complainant and the appellant.  The trial judge isolates various
    parts of the evidence that address specific things that occurred during the
    interaction between the appellant and the complainant.  He subjects each
    of these small pieces of a much larger evidentiary picture to a microscopic
    and discrete analysis.  That approach is not conducive to accurate fact-finding
    or fair credibility assessments.  A reading of the trial judge’s lengthy
    reasons suggests that he missed the forest for the trees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    submits that the trial judge erred in rejecting the appellant’s evidence
    as unworthy of belief for reasons that were not supported by the record.  The
    reasons for the trial judge’s total rejection of the appellant’s exculpatory
    evidence are set out below:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the conclusion
    of my review of the entire case, I have found that I cannot credit the following
    elements of the testimony of the defendant.  Firstly, I reject totally, as
    being false and mendacious, the denial advanced by the defendant of any knowledge
    of the quite recent sexual activity of the complainant. 
    Secondly, I reject totally, as also being false and mendacious, the testimony
    advanced by the defendant to the effect that he had not paid much attention
    to the romantic situation of the complainant.  Thirdly, I cannot credit in
    any <u>respect his account of the actions he ascribes to himself and to the
    complainant during the sexual act by reason of the almost total absence of
    details in chief, and in cross-examination until pressed by the prosecutor.</u>  Accordingly,
    I have no confidence in his general credit as a witness by reason of the
    combined effect of the three above noted conclusions. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    submits that none of the three findings of the trial judge are supported
    by the trial record.  We need address only the finding that the absence of
    detail in the appellant’s evidence warranted the rejection of that evidence
    as incredible.  That finding played a crucial role in the trial judge’s assessment
    as he referred to it on several occasions during his reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have reviewed the evidence of the appellant.  He answered the questions that
    were put to him.  His failure to offer detail not sought by the questions
    asked cannot provide a reasonable basis for disbelieving the appellant’s
    evidence.  Counsel examining the appellant in-chief may have chosen, for
    tactical reasons, to avoid detail, leaving it to the cross-examiner to extract
    details.  Whatever the merits of that tactic, it cannot be used as a ground
    for disbelieving the evidence of the appellant who simply answered the questions
    put to him by his counsel.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also do not agree that the appellant’s evidence concerning the interaction
    with the complainant was devoid of detail in his examination-in-chief.  The
    examination-in-chief was not lengthy but it did provide some detail on a
    level that was not inappropriate to the subject matter of the questions.  It
    is hardly surprising that a witness, be it the complainant or the accused,
    when asked to describe an act of sexual intercourse cannot necessarily go
    into the minute detail of each and every physical movement that occurred
    during the sexual activity.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found against the appellant’s credibility on a basis that was
    not open to him.  The verdict cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial record does not reasonably support
    any verdict other than acquittal.  We cannot agree with that submission.  The
    complainant’s evidence provided a basis upon which a reasonable trier of
    fact could convict.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    need not address the numerous other arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant.  We
    would observe, however, that there is merit to the submission made by the
    Crown in the course of oral argument, that some of the deficiencies found
    by the trial judge in the complainant’s evidence were also unsupported by
    the record.  Others were so minor as to justify no role in a reasonable assessment
    of the reliability of her evidence.  The errors in the trial judge’s treatment
    of the complainant’s evidence do not, however, assist the Crown in resisting
    the appellant’s appeal.</p>
