    principal issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge committed a palpable
    and overriding error by concluding that the appellant tenant and the respondent
    landlord reached a binding lease agreement outside the terms of the Offer
    to Lease that they had signed. In our view he did. Therefore, we set aside
    the judgment in favour of the landlord and dismiss the action.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Background</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 9, 2002, the parties entered into a binding Offer to Lease the 11th
    floor of the respondent landlord’s building commencing April, 2003. That
    Offer provided in Paragraph 30 that within ten days, the landlord would deliver
    its standard lease agreement incorporating the terms and conditions contained
    in the offer; that the tenant could seek reasonable further minor non-financial
    amendments; and that the parties would use their<b> </b>best efforts to execute
    the lease within twenty days of the completed offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the landlord delivered its standard form lease, the parties began to negotiate
    a host of new or amended terms, including significant financial changes to
    the Offer to Lease. The negotiations continued into December, 2002. Following
    the last set of requested changes from the tenant, many of which the landlord
    did not accept, the landlord instructed its representative, a law clerk from
    the McCarthy Tetrault firm, to finalize the lease and send the execution
    copies to the tenant. These were sent on January 7, 2003. A principal of
    the landlord testified it was his understanding that at that point, the parties
    had come to an agreement on the terms of the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    tenant did not agree. It had a lawyer respond with further requests for changes,
    including significant changes to financial aspects of the lease that the
    tenant had not agreed to and that<b> </b>were not in the Offer to Lease.
    The landlord maintained that it would not make any further changes to the
    final lease document it had tendered for execution. When the tenant would
    not sign the final form of lease, the landlord declared the tenant in default
    of the agreement and terminated the lease, claiming damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    over a year, the landlord was unable to re-rent the space. Finally, in early
    2004, it rented the space to a new tenant at a lower rent but for a longer
    term. In the spring of 2005, during the term of the lease, the landlord sold
    the building.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Findings of the
      Trial Judge</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the final form of lease sent by the landlord on January
    7, 2003 differed significantly from the Offer to Lease. These differences
    included the operating hours of business in the building, the requirement
    of a security deposit, and the inclusion of a management or administration
    fee. The final form of lease also did not include an obligation, previously
    agreed by the landlord, to rectify a vibration problem on the 11th floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge further found that the parties had negotiated the form and content
    of the lease outside the terms of paragraph 30 of the Offer to Lease, and
    that they had reached an agreement on its form and content. He concluded
    that the tenant breached the agreement when it failed to enter into the lease
    in the landlord’s final form of lease and was liable to the landlord for
    damages.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Issues and Analysis</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error
    by finding that the parties had agreed to the form and content of a lease
    outside the terms of paragraph 30 of the Offer to Lease. We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    it appears to us that although the witness for the landlord testified he
    understood that the January 7, 2003 final form of lease reflected terms agreed
    to by the parties, there is no evidence in the record to support that understanding.
    This witness played no role in the lease negotiations. In contrast to his
    understanding, the written and e-mail correspondence between the representatives
    of the parties shows an ongoing disagreement regarding significant substantive
    terms that the landlord was insisting upon and had included in the January
    7 final form of lease. These terms were not in the Offer to Lease and had
    not been accepted by the tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge bolstered his finding of an agreement by drawing an adverse inference
    against the tenant, who called no evidence on the issue. However, in our
    view, an adverse inference was not available on this record. The landlord’s
    claim of an agreement was undermined by the documentary record, which showed
    that there was no agreement. An adverse inference cannot add weight to evidence
    of a belief or understanding that is belied by the record on which it was
    said to be based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the parties had not come to an agreement on new terms of the lease, the landlord
    could have insisted that the tenant sign a lease in the form of the Offer
    to Lease to which the tenant was bound. The landlord did not do so. Instead
    it insisted that the tenant enter into a lease in the form of the January
    7, 2003 document. That form contained significant terms to which the tenant
    had not agreed. Accordingly<b>,</b> the landlord was not entitled to take
    the position it did. By refusing to sign the lease in that form, the tenant
    did not breach its agreement with the landlord.  The landlord, therefore,
    had no cause of action against the tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that, unknown to the landlord, the tenant was looking for other
    space, and therefore likely was looking for a way out of its agreement with
    the landlord. However, the landlord could not impose on the tenant a new
    lease, which the tenant had not agreed to and which was not in accordance
    with the Offer to Lease. For that reason the landlord’s action must fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties challenged aspects of the trial judge’s approach to the calculation
    of damages. One aspect is the method the trial judge used for calculating
    the present value of the unpaid future rent for the unexpired term of the
    lease. Another aspect is the effect of the sale of the property by the landlord
    during the currency of the lease term. Because we are setting aside the finding
    that the tenant was in breach of the lease, the issue of the proper calculation
    of damages is now moot. As a result, we will not address these issues. We
    should not, however, be taken as affirming the trial judge’s approach to
    the issue of damages or the conclusion he arrived at.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the above reasons, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set aside and judgment
    is granted in favour of the appellant dismissing the action with costs. The
    appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal, fixed at $22,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.  The costs of the trial should be fixed by the
    trial judge.</p>
