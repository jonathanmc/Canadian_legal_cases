    respondent did not appear for the appeal.  From the material filed, it is
    apparent that he is aware of the date but has not advised the court that

    agree with the appellant Crown that the trial judge found that all of the
    essential elements of the offences of tax evasion and of making false statements
    in the tax return had been made out.  At para. 94 of her reasons she found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hunter made false statements in his 1996
    and 1997 T1Returns of Income and that he intentionally made the statements
    knowing that they were false.  I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Hunter engaged in a course of conduct that avoided or attempted
    to avoid the payment of tax imposed by the <i>Income Tax Act</i>; that Mr.
    Hunter knew there was tax imposed by the Act; and that Mr. Hunter engaged
    in the conduct for the purpose of avoiding or attempting to avoid payment
    of tax imposed by the Act or knowing that avoiding payment of tax imposed
    by the Act was a virtually certain consequences of his actions.  Mr. Hunter
    wilfully evaded compliance with his obligation to pay taxes in 1996 and 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge acquitted the respondent, however, because she was not able to
    calculate the amount of income tax that the respondent had not paid.  At
    para. 39 of her reasons, she inferred that the opening net worth statement
    understated the respondent’s assets because no amount was attributed to take
    into account the possibility that the value of the shares owned by the respondent
    in December 1995 exceeded the $8,005 indicated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the burden of proof remains on the Crown, the taxpayer is required to keep
    proper books and records. The opening net worth statement represented all
    of the tax payor’s existing assets based on the documentation that had been
    seized.  The statement was an approximation because the respondent did not
    keep proper records and did not testify as to his net worth. The appellant
    submits that it is only if a net worth statement was so inaccurate that it
    totally undermined the conclusion that any tax was owed that the respondent
    should have been acquitted on the evidence. We have no evidence that the
    net worth statement here are is grossly inaccurate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown tendered evidence that the taxpayer had a certain amount of assets
    as of a particular date and had increased his net worth as a result of taxable
    income that had not been disclosed. The taxpayer offered no evidence by way
    of explanation. In these circumstances, the Crown is not required to negate
    every possibility respecting the amounts put forward especially when the
    matters in issue are peculiarly within the knowledge of the taxpayer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed, the acquittals are set aside and convictions entered.  The
    matter is remitted to the trial judge for sentencing.</p>
