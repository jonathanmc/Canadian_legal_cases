  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Maria
    Wong was murdered in the garage of her home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario at about 9:00 p.m. on February 11, 1999.  Her husband, (Johnny) Wong,
    and the three appellants were charged with first degree murder.  All four
    were convicted.  All four originally appealed their convictions, but Mr.
    Wong has abandoned his appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    convictions are attacked on three grounds:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>counsel
    for Figueroa argues that the trial judge erroneously told the jury that lies
    told by Figueroa to the police could be used as circumstantial evidence of
    Figueroa’s involvement in the plan to murder Mrs. Wong;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all
    counsel argue that the positions of the defence and the evidence relevant
    to those positions were not adequately put to the jury by the trial judge;
    and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all
    counsel argue that the “<i>Vetrovec</i>” instruction given with respect to
    the two principal Crown witnesses was inadequate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court did not call on the Crown to answer the arguments relating to the positions
    of the defence and the “<i>Vetrovec</i>” instruction.  Neither aspect of
    the charge warrants appellate intervention.  Nor do I see any value in an
    extended examination of those issues.  The applicable legal principles are
    well known and it comes down to whether in the circumstances of this case
    this charge complied with those principles.  I think it did.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am, however, satisfied that the first ground of appeal outlined above must
    succeed.  The trial judge should have told the jury, as he initially intended
    to do, that Mr. Figueroa’s statements to the police could not assist the
    jury in determining whether Mr. Figueroa was a party to an agreement to murder
    Mrs. Wong.  For the reasons that follow, I think he erred in failing to give
    this instruction and that the error requires a new trial for all three appellants.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>II</h2>
  <h4>THE TRIAL</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> At
    the trial, the Crown claimed that Mr. Wong was under financial pressure because
    of large gambling debts and that he stood to benefit financially from his
    wife’s death.  The Crown argued that Mr. Wong went to his friend and co-worker,
    the appellant Jones, and asked if Jones could assist him in arranging the
    murder of his wife.  Jones agreed to help Mr. Wong.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    December 1998, Jones met with his long-time friend, James Pierce.  According
    to Pierce, Jones said he had agreed to kill somebody, but was unable to do
    it himself.  Jones asked Pierce if he could find someone who could do the
    job and make it look like an accident.  Pierce made some inquiries and was
    eventually given the phone number of the appellant, Ortiz.  He did not know
    Ortiz.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pierce
    met with Ortiz, who was accompanied by the appellant Figueroa.  Ortiz agreed
    to perform the murder for a price of between $7,000 and $9,000.  Pierce,
    Ortiz and Figueroa later met to plan the specifics of the proposed murder.  On
    the Crown theory, after earlier aborted efforts, the murder occurred on February
    11 at about 9:00 p.m. in the garage of the Wong household.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argued that Ortiz was the actual killer and that Figueroa was present
    at the murder scene and acted as a lookout.  On the Crown’s theory, Pierce
    was nearby in a rented automobile with his girlfriend, Lisa Bateman.  A third
    party, who was not ultimately charged, was with Pierce, Ortiz and Figueroa
    but fled the scene of the murder before Ortiz killed Mrs. Wong.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Jones
    and Wong were at their place of business in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham on the evening of February 11.  During that evening, Pierce and Jones
    spoke several times on their cell phones.  Wong spoke with Jones several
    times.  The Crown contended that the plan to murder Mrs. Wong and modifications
    to that plan were discussed in the course of these telephone conversations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s case was based primarily on the evidence of Pierce and Bateman.  Pierce
    was originally charged with first degree murder.  He entered into a plea
    bargain after the preliminary inquiry pursuant to which he pled guilty to
    conspiracy to commit murder and received a sentence of sixteen years (plus
    two and a half years pre-trial custody) in exchange for his testimony.  On
    his testimony, Pierce was a prime mover in the planned and deliberate murder
    of Mrs. Wong.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Bateman was not charged with any offence.  She was placed in the Witness
    Protection Program.  On the evidence, she could have been charged, at least
    as an accessory after-the-fact to murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pierce
    testified that he and Bateman, along with Ortiz, Figueroa and the third person,
    went to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Markham in the early evening of February 11 in a car rented by Pierce.  They
    intended to ambush and murder Mrs. Wong as she left the public library following
    her English classes.  When it developed that Mrs. Wong could not be killed
    outside of the library, they decided to kill her at her home.  The details
    of the murder plan changed as the evening progressed.  Pierce was in constant
    cell phone contact with Jones, and Jones was speaking to Mr. Wong.  Mr. Wong
    phoned his home and spoke with his wife after she arrived home from the library.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Pierce, some time after Mrs. Wong had returned home from the library,
    Jones called him and said that it had been arranged that Mrs. Wong would
    leave the home in her car and return shortly afterward.  It was the Crown’s
    position that Jones had called Mr. Wong and asked him to get his wife out
    of the house so that she could be killed away from the home.  According to
    this theory, Mr. Wong called his wife and asked her to get some “takeout” food
    at a local restaurant.  Mr. Wong acknowledged in his statement to the police
    that he spoke to his wife in the early evening of February 11 about getting
    some “takeout”
    food.  Ortiz called Pierce a short time after Pierce spoke to Jones to tell
    Pierce that they had missed Mrs. Wong when she left her home in her vehicle.  Pierce
    told Ortiz to wait for Mrs. Wong’s return.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bateman
    and Pierce sat in the rental car waiting for Mrs. Wong to return.  Ortiz,
    Figueroa and the third party were lying in wait for Mrs. Wong somewhere near
    the garage.  Between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m., Bateman saw the victim’s car returning
    towards her home.  She alerted Pierce.  Pierce called Ortiz and warned him
    that Mrs. Wong was about to arrive home.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    short time later, while Bateman and Pierce were still in the car, Pierce
    received separate telephone calls from Ortiz, Figueroa and the third man.  Pierce
    picked the three men up at different locations near Mrs. Wong’s home.  They
    returned to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Ortiz told Pierce that he stabbed Mrs. Wong after she got out of
    her vehicle in the garage.  He said he had stabbed her three times.  Ortiz
    took Mrs. Wong’s car and abandoned it a short distance away hoping to make
    it appear as though Mrs. Wong had been killed by a carjacker.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    pathology evidence confirmed that Mrs. Wong had been attacked and stabbed
    in the neck three times. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pierce
    testified that when he picked Ortiz up after the murder, he saw blood on
    Ortiz’s clothing.  He made Ortiz remove his clothing before getting into
    the vehicle.  Pierce later destroyed that clothing.  Pierce also took the
    murder weapon from Ortiz, a knife Pierce had purchased a few weeks earlier,
    broke the knife handle into pieces and threw the blade into Lake Ontario.  The
    police later recovered a knife blade from the area where Pierce said he had
    thrown the knife blade.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bateman’s
    evidence was consistent in most respects with Pierce’s testimony.  He had
    heard her testify at the preliminary inquiry when he was still an accused.  There
    were, however, some differences in their evidence and the defence relied
    on these differences as one avenue of attack on the credibility of Pierce
    and Bateman. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence submitted that Bateman was not credible.  In addition to her role
    as an accomplice, the defence argued that Bateman was enamoured with the
    notion of being the leading witness in a high profile murder case.  The defence
    contended that her evidence was fabricated and motivated by a desire to not
    only avoid jail, but also to gain attention and further her dream of writing
    screenplays.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    Bateman and Pierce told several lies to the police while under oath and gave
    inconsistent versions of the relevant events in various statements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was some evidence capable of confirming some material aspects of the evidence
    of Pierce and Bateman.  Toll records for the 407 Highway and cell phone records
    offered some support for Pierce’s description of his movements and those
    of the appellants in the weeks preceding the murder and on the night of the
    murder.  The defence, however, contended that in some respects the telephone
    records were inconsistent with specific parts of Pierce’s testimony as it
    related to the events of February 11.  The defence also placed reliance on
    the evidence that Pierce had put his cell phone on forward at the time when
    Mrs. Wong was being killed.  The defence argued that this supported the claim
    that Pierce was the actual killer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wong
    was the only accused to give evidence at trial.  He testified that he had
    nothing to do with his wife’s murder and that he loved her very much.  Wong
    acknowledged that he was a serious gambler and accumulated significant gambling
    debts from time to time.  Wong denied that he was under any pressure to repay
    these debts or that he could not repay them in a timely fashion.  He offered
    records in support of this position.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Wong also led evidence that he did not stand to make significant financial
    gains from his wife’s death.  He never made a claim under the only insurance
    policy under which he was the beneficiary.  That policy only provided for
    a $100,000 payout in the event of Mrs. Wong’s death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Wong left for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong on a one-way ticket with his elderly father a few weeks after his
    wife’s murder.  The Crown relied on this as evidence of flight indicative
    of Mr. Wong’s involvement in the homicide.  Although Mr. Wong did not return
    voluntarily to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , but had to be extradited, he denied that he fled there to avoid prosecution.  Mr.
    Wong offered an explanation for his trip and claimed that he kept the police

    an extensive investigation, Figueroa and the other appellants were arrested
    in late August 1999, about six months after the murder.  Figueroa was cautioned
    and spoke with counsel.  He gave a lengthy statement to the police in which
    he denied any knowledge of, and any involvement in the murder.  He denied
    that he was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham on the evening of February 11, the night of the murder.  In the course
    of the interview, the police confronted Figueroa with cell phone records
    placing his cell phone in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Markham on February 11.  Figueroa told the police that he regularly lost
    his cell phone when he was drunk.  Figueroa indicated that the cell phone
    would routinely be returned to him a few weeks after he had lost it.  </p>

    in
    <st1:City

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Markham on the evening of February 11 with Ortiz and Pierce.  Counsel took
    the position that Figueroa went to

    <st1:City

    Markham with Ortiz and Pierce to steal Mrs. Wong’s car and, presumably, whatever
    valuables she had on her person.  Counsel submitted that Figueroa lied to
    the police to conceal his involvement in a conspiracy to carjack in the course
    of which Pierce, acting on his own, had killed Mrs. Wong. </p>

    to the police in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Norman Figueroa
    gave a lengthy statement to the police on August the 31<sup>st</sup>, 1999.  In

    Markham and he suggested that he had lost his cell phone when confronted
    with the suggestion by the police that the group was placed there by the
    records that had been obtained.  <u>He concedes that that was a lie and now
    suggests through his counsel’s submissions that he only went there to steal.  This
    conceded false explanation may go some distance in confirming his involvement

    cannot confirm the involvement of any of the other alleged participants.  <u>This
    evidence would, of course, lose its confirmatory potential if you are not
    satisfied that it was concocted by him to cover up his involvement in this

    as an issue of fact.  This was also a perfect opportunity for Norman Figueroa
    to advance his present defence that James Pierce murdered Maria Wong in a

    discussions, the Crown had conceded that Figueroa’s lies to the police could
    not be used to support the inference that Figueroa was a party to a murder
    plot because those lies were equally consistent with Figueroa’s having been
    a party only to an agreement to steal Mrs. Wong’s car during which she was
    murdered by Pierce acting on his own.  Trial counsel further indicated that,
    on her understanding, the trial judge had agreed with the Crown’s concession
    that the evidence of Figueroa’s lies were not probative of Figueroa’s involvement

    132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), he had concluded that it was open to the

  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Post-offence
    conduct, including lies to the police, is a kind of circumstantial evidence.  The
    jury is asked to infer the existence of a fact in issue, e.g. the identity
    of the perpetrator, from post-offence conduct committed by the accused, e.g.
    lies to the police.  The inference is permissible only if, based on human
    experience and common sense, that inference is a reasonable one.  As with
    any kind of circumstantial evidence, the inferences to be drawn from post-offence
    conduct will depend on the nature of that conduct, the fact that is sought
    to be inferred from that conduct, the position of the parties, and the totality
    of the evidence.  Inference drawing is situation-specific and is not amenable
    to a set of preset rules that categorize certain kinds of post-offence conduct
    as always relevant to, or never relevant to, a particular fact in issue:  <i>R.
    v. White </i>(1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at paras. 19-22 (S.C.C.);  <i>R.
    v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 at paras. 24-31 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a matter of human experience and common sense, Figueroa’s lies to the police
    were reasonably capable of supporting the inference that he was criminally
    involved in Mrs. Wong’s death.  A reasonable jury could infer that Figueroa
    lied to the police as to his whereabouts on February 11 because he was involved
    in Mrs. Wong’s death.  That is not to say that involvement in Mrs. Wong’s
    death was the only inference reasonably open from Figueroa’s lies to the
    police.  There were other possible explanations.  As with all circumstantial
    evidence, it was for the jury to decide which, if any, of the competing reasonable
    inferences should be drawn from the after-the-fact conduct:  <i>R. v. White</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it is for the jury to choose among reasonable inferences available from the
    evidence, the jury cannot be invited to draw speculative or unreasonable
    inferences.  Post-offence conduct may reasonably support the inference that
    an accused was involved in the offence alleged, but may provide no reasonable
    inference as to the nature of that participation or the accused’s state of
    mind at the relevant time.  Either or both may be crucial to the accused’s
    level of culpability.  Where after-the-fact conduct cannot reasonably assist
    in fixing an accused’s level of culpability, the jury should be told that
    the evidence has no probative value in determining the accused’s level of
    culpability:  <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. White</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 28, Major J. described the circumstances
      in which the limited potential probative value of after-the-fact conduct
      should be explained to the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Such an instruction
    [a no probative value instruction] is most <u>likely to be warranted where,
    as in <i>Arcangioli</i> itself, the accused has admitted to committing the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of a criminal act but has denied a specific level of culpability
    for that act, or has denied committing some related offence arising from
    the same operative set of facts.</u>  In such cases, the participation of
    the accused in the culpable event is not in issue; the question to be decided
    is merely the extent or legal significance of that participation.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    made it clear that after-the-fact conduct will often not assist in fixing
    an accused’s level of culpability, Major J. observed at para. 32 that there
    could be cases where after-the-fact conduct was relevant to the level of
    culpability:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This distinction
    provides some guidance as to when a “no probative value” instruction will
    be warranted, but it is not a formula.  <u>The result will always turn on
    the nature of the evidence in question and its relevance to the real issues
    in dispute.  It is possible to imagine cases in which evidence of post-offence
    conduct could logically support a distinction between two levels of culpability
    for a single act, or between two offences arising from the same set of facts.</u>  By
    way of illustration, where the extent of the accused’s flight or concealment
    is out of all proportion to the level of culpability admitted, it might be
    found to be more consistent with the offence charged.…  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    trial judge, after initially deciding that Figueroa’s lies could not assist
    in determining his level of culpability as between manslaughter and first
    degree murder, changed his mind and instructed the jury that the lies could
    logically support the inference that Figueroa was a participant in a scheme
    to murder Mrs. Wong rather than a participant in a scheme to steal her car
    during which she was unexpectedly murdered by Pierce.  </p>

    see no reasonable basis upon which a jury could find that Figueroa’s lies
    to the police were more consistent with his involvement in a murder scheme
    than with his involvement in a carjacking scheme during which Pierce murdered
    Mrs. Wong.  On either scenario, Figueroa was implicated in serious criminal
    conduct and could reasonably be expected to attempt to conceal that involvement
    from the police.  I do not think it can be said that Figueroa’s lies are
    in any way out of proportion to his potential culpability for manslaughter.  Nor
    do I see anything in the substance of the lies told by Figueroa that could
    reasonably point to involvement in a murder scheme as opposed to involvement
    in the carjacking scheme.  </p>

    cannot accept this submission.  The reasonable inferences available from
    circumstantial evidence must depend primarily on the nature of the evidence
    and the issue to which that evidence is directed.  Where more than one inference
    is reasonably available, the rest of the evidence will become important in
    determining which of those inferences should be drawn.  Where, however, the
    inference argued for by the Crown does not reasonably flow from the circumstantial
    evidence in issue, the existence of other evidence implicating the accused

    somewhat extreme example demonstrates the fallacy of the Crown’s argument.  The
    Crown could not argue, based on evidence that an accused was seen ten miles
    from the scene of a murder a week before the murder, that the jury should
    infer from that evidence that the accused was at the scene of the murder
    when it occurred.  The suggested inference would be speculative and unreasonable.  That
    inference would remain speculative and unreasonable even if a witness gave
    direct evidence placing the accused at the scene of the murder when it occurred.  If,
    however, the circumstantial evidence placed the accused at the scene of the
    murder shortly after it occurred, that evidence could reasonably support
    the inference that the accused was at the scene when the murder occurred.  The
    strength of that inference would be enhanced by the direct evidence of the
    witness placing the accused at the scene of the murder.  </p>

    Pierce’s evidence, reference to one was followed almost immediately by reference
    to the other.  Their defences were identical.  Ortiz and Figueroa were, on
    the Crown’s theory, two parts of the same unit.  The chance that a jury,
    acting reasonably, could return different verdicts with respect to Ortiz
    and Figueroa was, to say the least, remote.  To the extent that different
    verdicts were possible, the evidence suggested manslaughter for Figueroa
    and murder for Ortiz.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the jury, as it could have on this instruction, improperly used the evidence
    of Figueroa’s lies to convict Figueroa of murder, that verdict must have
    damaged Ortiz’s chances of a conviction for the included offence of manslaughter.  On
    the evidence led by the Crown, it would have been perverse to find Ortiz
    less liable than Figueroa.  Ortiz’s conviction is tainted by the misdirection
    and must be set aside.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s argument that Jones’ conviction was not tainted by the misdirection
    concerning Figueroa’s lies to the police is somewhat stronger than the argument
    that Ortiz’s conviction was not tainted.  However, I accept counsel for Jones’
    contention that the conviction of Figueroa for first degree murder could
    well have affected the verdict returned against Jones.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown alleged that the murder was the product of a contract killing arranged
    through Jones.  The conviction of Figueroa and Ortiz as the perpetrators
    of the murder could not help but enhance the Crown’s case against Jones,
    the person who, on the Crown’s case, provided the link between the individuals
    who actually participated in the murder and Mr. Wong, the individual who
    wanted Mrs. Wong murdered.  The Crown has not convinced me that the verdict
    as against Jones would necessarily have been the same had the trial judge
    not misdirected the jury concerning the use it could make of the lies told
    to the police by Figueroa.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is one further feature of this case that weighs against the application of
    the <i>curative proviso</i>.  There was an extensive pre-charge discussion
    among the trial judge and counsel.  The discussion took place before counsel’s
    closing addresses.  As indicated above, the trial judge accepted the Crown’s
    concession that Figueroa’s lies could not assist the Crown in proving that
    Figueroa was a party to an agreement to murder Mrs. Wong.  On this concession,
    Figueroa’s lies to the police did not hurt his position since he acknowledged
    his liability for manslaughter.  Counsel addressed the jury on the basis
    of the Crown’s concession as accepted by the trial judge and did not refer
    to the evidence of Figueroa’s lies to the police or the inferences that should
    be drawn from them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge ultimately decided to give a very different instruction to the
    jury as to the use it could make of Figueroa’s evidence.  For unknown reasons,
    he did not discuss this proposed change with counsel before he instructed
    the jury.  Counsel never had an opportunity to convince the trial judge that
    his initial impression was the correct one, or to deal with Figueroa’s evidence
    on the basis that the trial judge ultimately left it with the jury.  For
    example, counsel did not have the opportunity to convince the jury that because
    Figueroa’s lies were equally consistent with his involvement in a carjacking
    they should not be taken as any evidence of his involvement in a planned
    murder.  The fact that counsel never had a chance to deal with the evidence
    on the basis that the trial judge left it with the jury adds to the prejudice
    caused by the trial judge’s misdirection.  </p>
