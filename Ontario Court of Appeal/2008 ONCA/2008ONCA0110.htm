line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded the appellant costs for a summary conviction prosecution
    for sexual assault and common assault, which was stayed on the eve of trial.  The
    Crown successfully appealed the costs award.  The appellant seeks leave to
    appeal from the order of the summary conviction appeal judge, and asks us
    to set aside the order and reinstate the trial judge’s costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that the costs award can only be upheld if the stay that
    terminated the prosecution was a judicial stay pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.
    In our view, the summary conviction appeal judge erred by characterizing
    the stay as a Crown stay pursuant to s. 579 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    The trial Crown made no reference to that provision. She did not direct that
    a stay be entered pursuant to s. 579, but rather asked the court to enter
    a stay and, in response, the trial judge explicitly stated that he was entering
    a judicial stay of proceedings. The Crown did not object to the judicial
    stay nor did it raise the point on the application for costs or in its notice
    of appeal. Given this record, we do not think it is possible to characterize
    the stay as other than a judicial stay pursuant to s. 24(1). We conclude,
    accordingly, that the trial judge had jurisdiction to award costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge and the summary conviction appeal judge both expressed, albeit
    for very different reasons, their frustration with the manner in which this
    case proceeded through the system.  The trial judge found that the delay
    and disclosure problems that led to the stay flowed from the Crown office’s
    dysfunctional organization, which resulted in the file being passed between
    different Crowns and no one individual assuming responsibility for the orderly
    investigation and prosecution of the case.  The summary conviction appeal
    judge essentially retried the matter and fundamentally disagreed with the
    trial judge’s key factual findings.  The appeal judge perceived the excessive
    demands made by defence counsel to be the true cause of the delay and disclosure
    problems. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is, of course, well established that a trial judge’s findings are entitled
    to deference on appeal.  In our view, the summary conviction appeal judge
    failed to pay appropriate heed to that important principle.  While, in the
    end, there may be some truth to the positions of both the trial judge and
    the summary conviction appeal judge, for the purposes of resolving this appeal,
    we do not find it necessary to engage in a detailed review of the conflicting
    findings of fact, as we are satisfied that even on the trial judge’s findings,
    the costs award cannot be sustained.  However, in fairness to the trial defence
    counsel, who were sharply rebuked by the summary conviction appeal judge,
    we observe that it was their persistent demands that the police investigate
    further that revealed the inadequacy of the case against the appellant and
    that led to the stay of prosecution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the Crown’s submission that to support a costs award under s.
    24(1), the misconduct that justifies the award must relate to the <i>Charter</i> breach.  As
    we read the trial judge’s reasons, there were three factors that motivated
    his costs award: problems with disclosure, inadequate police investigation,
    and delay in bringing the matter to trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis on this record for a costs award to sanction inadequate disclosure.
    This was not a case where the Crown proceeded to trial without having made
    proper disclosure.  By the time the trial judge stayed the proceedings, the
    Crown had provided full disclosure.  The problem, if any, was the time it
    took to achieve full disclosure and that concern is subsumed by the issue
    of delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge placed considerable weight on what he regarded as the inadequacy
    of the police investigation.  While that allegation, if made out, might support
    a claim for damages based upon negligent investigation, it does not give
    rise to a <i>Charter</i> breach and does not accordingly support an s. 24(1)
    remedy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    leaves delay as the only factor potentially capable of supporting a <i>Charter</i> breach
    and a resultant costs award. While the delay here – sixteen months – was
    sufficient to trigger an inquiry under s. 11(b), it was not so egregious
    as to provide a basis for costs, absent Crown misconduct or some other exceptional
    circumstance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. 974649 Ontario Inc</i>. (2001), 159 C.C.C. 321 (3d) at para. 87, the
      Supreme Court of Canada held that costs may be awarded for a <i>Charter</i> breach,
      but only where there has been “a marked and unacceptable departure from
      the reasonable standards expected of the prosecution.”  In our view, the
      trial judge’s findings fall short of bringing this case within that principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge expressly found that there was nothing amounting to high-handed,
    cavalier, or oppressive conduct on the part of the Crown lawyers involved
    in this case. Rather, he found that “the cumulative effect of their miscommunication”,
    flowing from what he regarded as dysfunctional organization in the Crown
    office during the pre-trial proceedings and the discharge of the Crown’s
    disclosure obligations, “resulted in an inadvertent error”.  This error put
    the appellant in the unenviable position of facing serious charges for sixteen
    months, only to see the case against him collapse on the eve of trial because
    of “non-disclosure, unreasonable delay and less than pro-active police investigation.”  The
    trial judge attributed these failings to
    “an over-worked and badly administered pre-trial and disclosure process”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the trial judge that our criminal justice system can neither be
    proud of nor satisfied with a process that allows an accused person to face
    serious but unfounded criminal charges for almost a year and a half that
    were ultimately not proceeded with.  However, costs awards in the criminal
    justice system are very much the exception rather than the rule and we cannot
    say that the nature of the <i>Charter</i> breach or the conduct of the Crown
    in this case reaches the standard mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada
    for a costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
