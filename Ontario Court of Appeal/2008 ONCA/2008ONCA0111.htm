    appellant moved before Justice Ground of the Superior Court of Justice to
    dismiss certain paragraphs of the statement of claim pursuant to rule 21.01(3)(b)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> on the ground that the claims advanced
    were derivative in nature and required leave of the court as provided in
    s. 246 of the Act.  The motion judge declined the relief sought and held
    that the claims were appropriately advanced in an oppression action.  In
    doing so, the motion judge observed that,

    enactment of the derivative and oppression action provisions of the [Act]”.    </p>

    respondent, Malata Group (HK) Limited (“Malata HK”), commenced an action
    against the appellant, Henry Chi Hang Jung.  According to the allegations
    in the statement of claim, Malata HK, Mr. Jung and Jimmy Jian Yuan Chen are
    the three shareholders of Malata Canada Ltd.  Jung and Chen each own approximately
    41 per cent of the common shares of Malata

  <h2>THE MOTION JUDGE’S REASONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s position is summarized in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[5]       I am of the view that the relief in clauses
    (b) and (c) above is clearly appropriate in an oppression action in that
    it is premised on the conduct of the Defendant causing the business affairs
    of Malata
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    to be carried on or conducted in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly
    prejudicial to Malata HK.  I am further of the view that it would be appropriate
    in an oppression action to seek the relief sought in clauses (a) and (j)
    above, being relief sought pursuant to the provisions of the unanimous shareholders
    agreement governing Malata Canada, in that it is the position of the Plaintiff
    that the same conduct constituted a breach of the unanimous shareholders
    agreement and entitles the Plaintiff to an order requiring that the Defendant
    sell his shares of Malata Canada to the Plaintiff. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[6]       The position of the Defendant appears
    to be principally based on the relief sought in clauses (d) and (e) above
    in that such relief is solely for the benefit of Malata Canada and the claims
    made by the Plaintiff in the action are therefore derivative in nature and
    cannot be brought within an oppression action.  The defendant relies on the
    rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> as enunciated by LaForest J. in <i>Hercules
    Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165 at paragraph
    59 as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>The rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> provides
    that individual shareholders have no cause of action for any wrongs done
    to the corporation and that if an action is to be brought in respect of such
    losses, it must be brought either by the corporation itself (through management)
    or by way of a derivative action.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[7]       In my view, the Defendant’s position ignores
    the development of the law in this province which recognizes that the rule
    in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> has been substantially diluted by the enactment
    of the derivative action and oppression action provisions of the <i>OBCA</i> and
    the case law recognizing that derivative actions and oppression actions are
    not mutually exclusive. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of his conclusion, the motion judge relied on three cases:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> (Securities Commission) v. McLaughlin</i>, [1987] O.J.
    No. 1247 (H.C.J.); <i>Deluce Holdings Inc. v. Air Canada</i> (1992), 12 O.R.
    (3d) 131 (Gen. Div.); and <i>Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Ontario Municipal
    Employees Retirement Board</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 191 (S.C.J.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>McLaughlin</i>,
    Henry J., on a motion to strike out a statement of claim, considered the
    scope of the then-relatively new oppression remedy section (then s. 247)
    of the Act and its relationship with the derivative actions section (then
    s. 245) of the Act.  In so doing, he made the following comment at para.
    12:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Under the new Part XVII there is no inconsistency
    in a derivative action under sec. 245 requiring leave and sec. 247 not being
    so limited; leave is required under sec. 245 to protect the corporation from
    frivolous and unwarranted interference by disaffected claimants who seek
    to inject the corporation into litigation as a party plaintiff for which
    the corporation may initially have to provide the financing.  The proceeding
    now created by sec. 247 on the other hand is quite different; it creates
    a new personal cause of action to which the corporation need not be a party.  A
    careful reading of the statement of claim reflects a claim for payment direct
    to plaintiffs and not to Mascan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Deluce</i>,
    the defendant moved to strike certain paragraphs of the statement of claim
    as being outside the scope of the oppression remedy.  In dismissing the motion,
    R.A. Blair J. said at p. 155:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The other thrust of Air
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s attack on the pleading was that the allegations raise claims which are
    the claims of Air
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and not those of Deluceco as shareholder.  The action is therefore
    derivative in nature and Deluceco requires leave of the court to commence
    it in relation to these claims, counsel submit.  There is authority, however,
    that merely because the plaintiffs in a minority shareholder oppression action
    rely on conduct which might in the first instance have caused harm to the
    company (and, therefore, give rise to a derivative claim), the plaintiffs
    are not deprived of their personal remedy under s. 241: see <i>Ontario (Securities
    Commission) v. McLaughlin</i> (1987), 11 O.S.C.B. 442 (H.C.J.) (Henry J.).  Accordingly,
    again, it cannot be said to be plain, obvious and beyond doubt that the plaintiff
    cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Ford</i>,
    Cumming J. said at para. 241:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Conduct which may result in harm to a company and
    may therefore be the subject of a derivative claim may also result in oppression
    to minority shareholders.  The presence of a derivative action remedy does
    not preclude minority shareholders from pursuing their personal remedy under
    s.&nbsp;241.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  (<i>Jabalee v. Abalmark
    Inc.,</i> [1996] O.J. No. 2609 at para. 5 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>Ontario Securities Commission v. McLaughlin</i> (1988), O.S.C.B. 442,

  <h2>            (i)        The Position of the Appellant</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the motion judge erred in ruling that Malata
    HK has the legal capacity to seek a declaration (as in subparagraph 1(c)
    of the statement of claim) that Mr. Jung has breached his statutory duties
    to the company to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best
    interests of the corporation as required by s.&nbsp;134(1)(a) of the Act.  As
    such, absent an order granting the leave of the court, the appellant lacks
    standing to proceed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of subparagraphs 1(d) and (e) of the statement of claim, in which
    the appellant seeks the return of monies owed to Malata Canada, counsel for
    the appellant submits that the motion judge erred in holding that these claims
    could be advanced pursuant to the oppression remedy, because the harm alleged
    was harm to the company, and therefore the claim can only be advanced by
    way of derivative action with leave of the court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant also argues that the oppression remedy cannot be invoked
    against an individual acting in his personal capacity.  He submits that Mr.
    Jung is being sued in his personal capacity and not in respect of his powers
    as a director.  Counsel for the appellant concludes, therefore, that the
    oppression remedy simply does not apply in these circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant further submits in respect of subparagraphs 1(a) and (j)
    that these claims assert breaches of the shareholder agreement which are
    subject to a 30-day notice period during which the appellant may correct
    its defaults.  Since this action was commenced before the 30-day notice period
    had expired, the respondent lacked the capacity to commence the action and
    the motion judge erred in failing to so find.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      The Position of the Respondent</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent’s position <i>simpliciter</i> is that the motion judge got it
    right.  Respondent’s counsel submits that derivative actions and claims made
    under the oppression remedy are not mutually exclusive.  There is a degree
    of overlap between the two.  Respondent’s counsel relies upon the endorsement
    in <i>Jabalee v. Abelmark Inc.</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 2609 where this court
    said at paras. 4-5:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The oppression remedy in section 248 of the <i>Ontario
      Business Corporations Act</i> is very broad and may well entitle a minority
      shareholder in a closely-held company to relief arising out of a director’s
      breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Equally, although some of the claims in the proposed
    amended statement of claim could be the subject of a derivative action, they
    may also make out a case of oppression.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  See <i>Deluce
    Holdings Inc. v. Air

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondent also argues that the respondent’s claims are based upon
    breaches of the shareholder agreement to which the respondent is a party
    and therefore his client is entitled to sue Mr. Jung directly for those breaches
    whether or not the breaches also caused harm to the company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondent further submits that Malata HK’s failure to abide by the
    30-day notice period for the curing of defaults under the shareholder agreement
    does not oust the jurisdiction of the court to entertain this action.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        The rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Laskin
    J.A. in <i>Meditrust Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug Mart</i> (2002), 61
    O.R. (3d) 786 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) succinctly stated the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> as follows at para.
    12:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> provides simply
    that a shareholder of a corporation – even a controlling shareholder or the
    sole shareholder – does not have a personal cause of action for a wrong done
    to the corporation.  The rule respects a basic principle of corporate law:
    a corporation has a legal existence separate from that of its shareholders.  See <i>Salomon
    v. Salomon</i>, [1897] A.C. 22, 66 L.J.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ch.</st1:country-region>
    35 (H.L.).  A shareholder cannot be sued for the liabilities of the corporation
    and, equally, a shareholder cannot sue for the losses suffered by the corporation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Meditrust</i> at
    para. 16, Laskin J.A. also considered the limits to the rule in <i>Foss v.
    Harbottle</i> as described by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hercules
    Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165 at para. 62:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> does not, of
    course, preclude an individual shareholder from maintaining a claim for harm
    done directly to it.  Again, in <i>Hercules</i>, LaForest J. explained the
    limit of the rule at p. 214 S.C.R.:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>One final point should be made here.  Referring
    to the case of <i>Goldex Mines Ltd. v. Revill</i> (1974), 7 O.R. (2d) 216
    (C.A.), the appellants submit that where a shareholder has been directly
    and individually harmed, that shareholder may have a personal cause of action
    even though the corporation may also have a separate and distinct cause of
    action.  Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs should be understood to detract
    from this principle.  In finding that claims in respect of losses stemming
    from an alleged inability to oversee or supervise management are really derivative
    and not personal in nature, I have found only that shareholders cannot raise
    individual claims in respect of a wrong done <i>to the corporation</i>.  Indeed,
    this is the limit of the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i>. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Can the claims advanced in subparagraphs 1(c), (d) and (e) be
    advanced under the oppression remedy of the Act?</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    answer to this question raises the distinction between derivative actions
    and oppression claims.  One author has described this distinction as
    “murky”: see Markus Keohnen, <i>Oppression and Related Remedies</i> (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2004) at 443.  Another author observed in 1991
    that, “for every holding that the oppression remedy may not be enlisted in
    a derivative cause, there is an opposite holding”: see Jeffrey G. MacIntosh. “The
    Oppression Remedy: Personal or Derivative?” (1991) 70

    appears from my reading of the case law that there is not a bright-line distinction
    between the claims that may be advanced under the derivative action section
    of the Act and those that may be advanced under the oppression remedy provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    to this overlap between the oppression remedy and the derivative action,
    a court cannot determine which is the appropriate avenue for a claim to proceed
    through the simple application of a rule such as the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i>.  Instead,
    a court must examine the relevant statutory text and the facts of the claim
    at issue.  I now turn to the language of s. 248.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsection
    248(2) of Act defines the nature of the conduct which is covered by the oppression
    remedy: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where, upon an application under subsection (1),

  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span

    that unfairly disregards the interests of any security holder, creditor,
    director or officer of the corporation, the court may make an order to rectify
    the matters complained of.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Subsection 248(3) sets out a non-exhaustive
    list of remedial orders available to the court.  In its preamble, s. 248(3)
    states that, “the court may make any interim or final order it thinks fit”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is stating the obvious to say that s. 248 of the Act is drawn in broad language,
    both in terms of the harms it addresses and the non-exhaustive list of remedies
    it contemplates.  Included in the list of remedies in s. 248(3) is a provision
    for “an order varying or setting aside a transaction or contract to which
    a corporation is a party and <i>compensating the corporation </i>or any other
    party to the transaction or contract”: see s.&nbsp;248(3)(h).  [Emphasis
    added.]  This provision contemplates a remedy under s. 248 that benefits
    the company itself even though the claim made by the complainant could also
    have been pursued by way of a derivative action.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    already noted, this court recognized in <i>Jabalee, supra</i>, that there
    is a degree of overlap between the claims that could be made out as derivative

    said at para. 5 of the endorsement, “[t]he two are not mutually exclusive.”   </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    situation in which the overlap between the oppression remedy and the derivative
    action can be found is where directors in closely held corporations engage
    in self-dealing to the detriment of the corporation and other shareholders
    or creditors.  A relevant case in this respect is <i>C.I. Covington Fund
    Inc. v. White</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 4589 (S.C.J.), in which Swinton J. observed
    at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A number of oppression cases turn on the fact that
    there has been conduct by directors or majority shareholders that amounts
    to self-dealing at the expense of the corporation or other corporate stakeholders
    (SCI Systems Inc. v. Gornitzki Thompson &amp;
    Little Co. (1997), 36 B.L.R. (2d) 207 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d (1998),

    Ltd. (1991), 5 B.L.R. (2d) 195 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)).  For example, in SCI,
    there was oppression because the directors unfairly removed assets from the
    corporation so as to prevent the payment of a corporate debt and to benefit
    themselves.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Covington</i>, the complainant purchased shares in and loaned money to
    a closely held company.  The respondent, the CEO and majority shareholder
    of the company (presumably also a director), misappropriated intellectual
    property (patents) belonging to the company, resulting in the company’s inability
    to pay its creditors.  Invoking s. 248(3) of the Act, the court ordered the
    respondent to cease using the technology related to the patents and assigned
    the patents and patent applications to the company.  In reaching this conclusion,
    Swinton J. said at paras. 46 and 47:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 248(3) of the OBCA confers a broad discretion
    on the Court in determining an appropriate remedy, including “any interim
    or final order it thinks fit”.  The purpose of the remedy is to rectify the
    oppression.  The provision has been used to make compensation orders against
    individual directors where their conduct has been found oppressive in small,
    closely held corporations such as Delta, and they have personally benefited – for
    example, by the removal of assets from the corporation (see, for example,
    SCI; Sidaplex, supra).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this case, Delta has represented that the patents
    and patent applications for the Snowfluent technology are the property of
    the corporation, and White, as a principal of the corporation, was behind
    those representations.  The cor-poration has a right to claim beneficial
    ownership at common law.  This is not a case where a monetary award against
    White will adequately protect the interests of the stake-holders, especially
    given his evidence that he faces financial difficulties personally.  If Delta’s
    proprietary interest is not protected, the corporation will be denied the
    value of the patents, both in terms of possible licensing fees for their
    use and their value if they can be sold.  Clearly, the creditors will be
    in a better position to recoup some of their funds if the patents are assets
    of the corporation which can be sold.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    find Swinton J.’s analysis persuasive and useful.  Although not identical,
    the circumstances in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Covington</i> are not dissimilar from the circumstances alleged in the
    statement of claim in this case.  The complainant in each case is a shareholder
    and creditor of a closely held corporation.  In both cases, the complainant
    alleges misappropriation of corporate property by another shareholder and
    director.  In both cases, a loss to the company results in a derivative loss
    to the complainant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    analysis begs the question of whether there is any meaningful distinction
    between the oppression remedy under s. 248 of the Act and the derivative
    action under s.&nbsp;246 of the Act.  In my view, allowing s. 248 oppression
    claims to proceed where there is harm to the corporation would not nullify
    s. 246, because the two sections involve different threshold tests.  Section
    246 simply requires a violation of the corporation’s legal rights.  On the
    other hand, s. 248 requires, in the case of harm to the corporation, a violation
    of corporate legal rights that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial, or
    that unfairly disregards the complainant’s interests.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is perhaps worth noting that another relevant difference between the derivative
    action and the oppression remedy relates to costs.  Subsection 247(d) explicitly
    allows a court to order the corporation to pay the legal fees or other costs
    reasonably incurred in connection with a derivative action.  The oppression
    remedy section of the Act, though it invests courts with broad remedial authority,
    contains no such provision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the appeal of the <i>Ford</i> case, <i>supra</i>, Rosenberg J.A., in a much
    different fact situation, considered the distinction between personal causes
    of action and derivative actions in the context of the oppression remedy
    under the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44.  He
    observed at paras. 111 and 112:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[111]   It seems to me that it would be a serious
    mistake to attempt to confine the broad discretion granted courts by the
    oppression remedy within a formal construct of causes of action.  To do so
    could bring with it all the complexities of the common law as to when a shareholder
    might, not-withstanding the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> … maintain a
    personal action and thrust those complexities into the oppression remedy.  Parliament
    could not have intended such a result.  The breadth of the remedy to which
    these shareholders are entitled must turn on the wording of the statutory
    provisions.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[112]   While s. 241 contemplates remedies that
    benefit the corporation or shareholders as a whole, it is nevertheless founded
    on the principle of a wrong done to a shareholder or identifiable group of
    shareholders.  Section 241(2)(<i>a</i>) (the provision relied upon in this
    case) is drawn in broad terms but it depends upon a finding that the complained
    of act or omission by the corporation or any of its affiliates “is oppressive
    or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly disregards the interests of any
    security holder, creditor, director or officer”.</p>

    is important in my view that in this case, we have a closely held corporation.  It

    the availability of resort to the court.  In my view, it would take express
    language in the agreement to accomplish that result, and the agreement here
    contains no such language.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.   </p>
  <h2>COSTS</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties are agreed that the appropriate award for the costs of the appeal
    is $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.  I would make that order in
    favour of the respondent. </p>
