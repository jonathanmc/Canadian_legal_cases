    is a Crown appeal from an order of Nordheimer J. staying nine charges of
    fraud over $5,000 against the respondent because there had been an unreasonable
    delay infringing his rights under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent is the former chief operating officer of a publicly traded company.  The
    charges arise out of alleged misrepresentation of the company’s financial
    affairs in its financial statements.  He was charged along with three others,
    who face additional charges as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was arrested and charged on October 22, 2002 following a police
    investigation that commenced in 1998.  His preliminary inquiry was completed
    on April 6, 2005 and a direct indictment was preferred against him on April
    18, 2005.  The respondent first appeared in the Superior Court on May 25,
    2005.  Nordheimer J. stayed the charges on June 22, 2007 at which time his
    trial was set for October 2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant recognizes that the length of the delay, approximately five years,
    is clearly sufficient to warrant scrutiny by the court.  However, the appellant
    submits that the application judge erred by understating the inherent time
    requirements of the case and by allocating to the Crown some delay that resulted
    when a trial date was lost. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge assessed the inherent time requirements to be nine months
    in the Ontario Court and six months in the Superior Court. The appellant
    submitted these assessments were too low relying mainly on the fact that
    this was a complex case with a massive volume of documentary evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Ontario Court, pre-trials were held throughout a year but the appellant
    urged this was necessary for the parties to grapple with the issues and evidence.  There
    was, the appellant said, no objection to the pace of proceedings.  The appellant
    had urged the application judge that the inherent time requirements in the
    Ontario Court should be set at fifteen months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;Russell Juriansz&quot; 20080214T1949'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Superior Court the appellant had urged the inherent time requirements
    should be set at eighteen months.  The respondent initially intended to represent
    himself and did not retain counsel until the summer of 2006.  The appellant
    submitted that it should have been apparent to the respondent that he needed
    counsel for this complex case before he retained one in the summer of 2006.  The
    appellant points out that when his counsel, once retained, was removed from
    the record in October of 2006, the respondent’s new counsel was not available
    for trial until September 2007 and a trial date was ultimately set for October
    2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    were all matters that were considered by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge recognized the size and complexity of the case but he also
    considered the long investigation in assessing its inherent time requirements.   He
    was clear that pre-charge delay could not be included in the consideration
    of whether the delay was unreasonable.  However, he went on to reason:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“if the complexity
    of the case and the amount of disclosure required is asserted as a reason
    to increase the inherent time requirements of the case then, in making the
    determination of what is a reasonable period of time for those steps, some
    consideration must, in fairness, be given to the amount of time that the
    police and the Crown had, or took, to address those issues before charges
    were laid.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found as a fact that the work done during the four-year
    investigation that preceded the laying of charges made it possible for the
    Crown to make disclosure in relatively short order.  He also found the record
    did not reveal why the several pre-trials were scheduled months apart. His
    careful reasons make clear he did not arbitrarily use the lengthy pre-charge
    investigation to reduce the assessment of the inherent time requirements
    of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted the respondent was unrepresented while the case was
    in the Ontario Court.  He also found as a fact that the rupture in the relationship
    between the respondent and his first counsel would not have occurred but
    for the loss of the trial date in October 2006.  The trial date was lost
    because of the disclosure, just before the trial was set to begin, of the
    induced statement of a co-accused who decided to plead guilty.  The new trial
    was ultimately scheduled for October of 2007, a year later.  The application
    judge divided that year equally between the complainant and the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the Crown should not be penalized for obtaining and
    disclosing an unforeseen witness statement.  While that may be so, it is
    not, on our reading of his reasons, the basis upon which the application
    judge proceeded.  The judge was aware from his experience in setting trial
    dates in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and that a new trial date could have been set about six months after
    the lost trial date.  As we see it, the six months the application judge
    attributed to the Crown was in the nature of institutional delay, for which
    the Crown is responsible.  The trial judge allocated the other six months
    to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    single largest cause of the delay in this case, as the application judge
    observed, was the busy schedules of counsel for the other accused.  He rejected
    the Crown’s position that the delay due to the unavailability of counsel
    for the co-accused should be considered neutral time.  He found on the facts
    of this case, the Crown consistently consented to delays in setting a trial
    date in order to accommodate the schedules of counsel for two of the other
    accused.  He found that the Crown had failed to consider the impact of delays
    on the appellant equally with its consideration of the schedules of counsel
    for the other accused.  He stated that as the time period lengthened, the
    Crown had to decide between ceasing its practice of accommodating those counsels’ schedules
    or proceeding with the appellant separately from those other accused.  We
    see no error in the application judge’s approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we agree that the application judge erred by failing to properly weigh
    and assess the compelling societal interest in this large case proceeding
    to trial.  In our view the application judge carefully applied the proper
    legal principles, balanced the appropriate factors including the inferred
    and actual prejudice suffered by the respondent.  In the end, and apart from
    the specific causes of this or that delay at various points in time, the
    matter must be viewed globally and even on the appellant’s argument, there
    remains a significant period of unreasonable delay.</p>
