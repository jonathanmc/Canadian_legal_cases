line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from a jury verdict that awarded the respondents Cody McMahon
    and John O. McMahon damages for malicious prosecution and the appellant,
    Wayne Scott, $1.00 damages for assault.  The appellants own a trailer park
    and the respondents are nearby cottagers who use a disputed right of way
    over the trailer park property.  The appellants reported incidents of alleged
    assaults by the respondents to the police, who laid criminal charges.  The
    respondents were acquitted and brought this action for malicious prosecution
    alleging, in essence, that the appellants, particularly, Wayne Scott lied
    to the police about the incidents and his injuries.  The jury trial occupied
    twelve days.  The trial judge charged and recharged the jury for more than
    four hours.  The length of the charge was dictated by the complexity of the
    issues and the factual background of the allegations.  The jury deliberated
    for more than a day before arriving at its verdict.  The appellants appeal
    on several grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants argue that the jury verdict was unreasonable regarding the
    Cody McMahon (Cody) allegations.  We do not agree.  There was a body of evidence
    from which it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellants lied to
    the police when they alleged Cody ran over Wayne Scott’s toe with a car.  The
    evidence included that of Cody that he did not back over Mr. Scott’s foot
    and the physical evidence regarding whether it was possible for Cody to have
    reversed the car over Mr. Scott’s foot, particularly, if the jury accepted
    that he backed straight up after the confrontation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable despite this evidence
    in light of other evidence including an audio-tape recorded by Wayne Scott
    at the time of the incident.  However, the audio-tape was not conclusive
    about what happened because its contents were open to interpretation and
    were challenged at trial.  The respondents’
    position at trial was that Wayne Scott’s audible expression of pain on the
    audio-tape, immediately following the sound of Cody’s car engine, was faked
    as was his physical action of hopping up and down as soon as Cody reversed
    his car.  In light of the evidence at trial to the effect that the appellants
    had set up the respondents, it was open to the jury to reject the audio-tape
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was also evidence that Wayne Scott’s toe was fractured and evidence of a
    tire mark on the white shoe Wayne Scott claimed to be wearing at the time
    of the incident.  However, particularly in the history of the circumstances
    and the allegations that the appellants set-up the respondents, it was open
    to the jury to conclude that the toe was not fractured by any action on the
    part of Cody McMahon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of the Cody McMahon allegations largely depended upon the jury’s
    credibility and factual findings.  The jury verdict establishes that the
    jury did not find Mr. Scott credible, but found Cody McMahon credible.  In
    these circumstances, it cannot be said that no jury properly instructed and
    acting judicially could have reached the verdict arrived at by this jury.  Accordingly,
    this ground of appeal does not succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants argue that there was no evidence to support the jury’s finding
    regarding the Jake McMahon (Jake) altercation and argue both that the trial
    judge ought to have allowed their motion for a directed verdict and, in any
    event, that there was no evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that Jake
    did not assault Wayne Scott.  The appellants argue that in light of indisputable
    evidence of an assault, they could not be liable for malicious prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    essence, it was the respondents’ position, given the long history of the
    circumstances surrounding the cottagers’ use of the right of way and the
    outstanding injunction, that Wayne Scott was attempting to set Jake up to
    involve him in an altercation for the purpose of generating grounds to prevent
    his continued use of the right of way.  It was in this context that the jury
    concluded that Wayne Scott consented to his physical removal from the right
    of way and then falsely reported an assault to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judge fairly put the issue to the jury on more than one occasion.  In the
    charge proper, the trial judge put the issue of the set up this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Was he at that
    point, when Mr. McMahon arrived, languishing on the road, or was he laying
    in wait to set Mr. McMahon up to assault him so that through charging him
    with assault he could stop him using the road?  You will want to consider
    why the tape recorder was going.  Mr. Scott said that he activated it before
    the meeting with Cody.  He said he wore it to protect himself because of
    problems in the past and had done that many times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her recharge, which was approved in advance by both counsel, the trial judge
    gave this instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    issue, as I said, that Mr. McMahon applied force.  The issue is the extent
    of it.  When you determine who you believe about the extent of the force,
    you will then decide if the nature or extent of the force was something that
    by his actions Mr. Scott consented to, or did it go beyond anything called
    for by Mr. Scott’s actions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, in a nutshell,
    was Mr. Scott inviting Mr. McMahon to push him aside?  If Mr. Scott wasn’t
    doing that, then there is no consent.  If there is no consent then Mr. Scott’s
    action for damages must succeed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you find
    that Mr. Scott was really inviting Mr. McMahon to push him aside, but Mr.
    McMahon’s actions went beyond what was necessary to push him aside, then,
    again, Mr. Scott’s claim for damages must succeed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you find
    Mr. Scott was really inviting Mr. McMahon to push him aside, and that is
    all that Mr. McMahon did, in other words if you accept Mr. McMahon’s version
    of events, then Mr. Scott’s claim for damages for assault fails.  Okay?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in these instructions in the unusual circumstances of this case
    and would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellants challenge the jury charge regarding the applicable legal principles
    and the inclusion of what the appellants refer to as “numerous marginal or
    irrelevant factual issues”.  However, these arguments are not supported by
    the reading of the jury charge as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    in response to concerns raised by the appellants, the trial judge re-charged
    the jury regarding the appellants’
    position to be certain that the jury was focussed on the important issues
    that were determinative of the claims.  Any concern the appellants had that
    the complexity of the issues may have distracted the jury from the proper
    focus were corrected in the recharge in the manner requested and approved
    by counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably,
    the trial counsel told the trial judge that she correctly charged on the
    legal principles and the charge on the facts was both fair and balanced.  We
    see no flaw in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury about the issue
    of consent, which was not premised on either the outstanding injunction regarding
    the interference with the right of way or any improper reference to honest
    belief.  Having been properly instructed, the central question of consent
    was primarily a factual one for the jury, which it was required to consider
    in the context of all the circumstances.  We see no reviewable error in the
    charge, including in any of the specific examples listed in the appellants’
    factum.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants argue that the $1 damage assessment regarding the separate
    assault by Mr. Bettes was perverse because counsel and the trial judge all
    proposed to the jury, in the event of liability, that a reasonable range
    for damages would be between $5,000 and $10,000.  However, the jury’s question,
    which we will discuss later in these reasons, clearly indicated that it determined
    the assault was “minor” and rejected as fabricated Mr. Scott’s evidence that
    he suffered a severe concussion rendering him unconscious and leaving him
    with ongoing neurological problems.  On the other hand, there was objective
    evidence that Mr. Scott suffered a superficial and transient abrasion to
    his cornea that would heal within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.  While
    another jury may have come to a different result on the basis of this abrasion,
    it was open to this jury to conclude that the appellant was entitled to no
    more than nominal damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cross-appeal relates to the jury’s verdict that Mr. Bettes assaulted Mr.
    Scott and its dismissal of Mr. Bettes’ claim against Mr. Scott for malicious
    prosecution.  It raises two issues.  First, Mr. Bettes argues the verdict
    of an assault was unreasonable in light of the contents of the question posed
    by the jury and second, that the trial judge ought to have instructed the
    jury that the finding of an assault did not necessarily lead to the conclusion
    that the prosecution was not malicious.  In the course of deliberations,
    the jury asked the following question:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>We the jury,
    feel in question 14 although there was an assault committed by John Bettes,
    this was part of a set up to get John Bettes to do or say something for a
    conviction on the camera.  We feel that the assault was a minor accident.  We
    would like to find a party responsible for the legal expenses incurred by
    Mr. John Bettes in the amount of $25000 special damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that this question is determinative of whether Mr. Bettes’ conduct
    was an accident and not an assault.  In response to the jury’s question,
    the trial judge properly instructed the jury that it could not award costs
    as special damages and the jury resumed its deliberations.  The next day
    the jury returned with its verdict that Mr. Bettes’ actions were an assault,
    but in accordance with their earlier characterization of it as
    “minor”, the jury limited Mr. Scott’s damages to $1.  The jury verdict also
    resulted in the dismissal of Mr. Bettes’ malicious prosecution claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first ground of unreasonable verdict, there was evidence capable of supporting
    the finding of an assault and, as discussed earlier, evidence of an injury.  It
    cannot be said that Mr. Bettes has met the high standard of review necessary
    to establish the verdict was unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second ground, Mr. Bettes argues that further instruction was required
    after the above question to tell the jury that if the assault was a minor
    accident, there would still be no evidence to justify the charge for the
    bodily harm aspect of the assault charge.  In our view, the question did
    not require a recharge on this issue because the jury must have found that
    there was some degree of bodily harm in the form of the corneal abrasion.  It
    follows that the fact of the abrasion could form the basis for Mr. Scott’s
    report to the police that he had been injured and, hence, led to the charge
    of assault causing bodily harm.  In any event, apparently no request was
    made to the trial judge for further instruction either on this basis or on
    the basis that the jury could conclude that the prosecution was malicious
    irrespective of a finding of assault.  Accordingly, we would not give effect
    to the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the appeal and the cross-appeal are dismissed.  Costs are payable by the
    appellants to the McMahon respondents in the amount of $10,000 plus G.S.T.  The
    success of the respondent Bettes on the appeal and cross-appeal was mixed.  There
    will be no order as to costs for or against Bettes in respect of the appeal
    or the cross-appeal.</p>
