    appellant, Ms. Oliveira, is a person with a disability who shares joint custody
    of her three young children with her ex-spouse on an alternating week basis.
    She receives income support under the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Disability Support Program Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c.
    25, Sched. B (ODSP Act). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ODSP Act is the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario government’s scheme for delivering social assistance to deserving
    applicants. Income support is calculated on a monthly basis and has three
    components: (1) a shelter allowance, intended for expenses such as rent,
    heat and hydro; (2) benefits, such as drug and dental coverage; and (3) basic
    needs, for expenses such as food and toiletries. The amount paid varies with
    the number of persons in a “benefit unit” that is, “a person and all of his
    or her dependants on behalf of whom the person receives or applies for income
    support”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s income support for herself is not in issue in this appeal.  Rather,
    the issue is whether she should receive 100 per cent of the basic needs component
    of income support for her children twelve months of the year.  Ms. Oliveira
    is appealing a decision of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, which dismissed her appeal from a decision of the Social
    Benefits Tribunal (the Tribunal or SBT), and confirmed a reduction in the
    basic needs component of her income support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Tribunal held that Ms. Oliveira was eligible for 100 per cent of the shelter
    component of income support for a recipient with three dependant children
    throughout the year. The Tribunal was of the opinion that the appellant should
    receive the full allowance for shelter costs because she still had to pay
    shelter costs when the children were in the care of her husband. The Tribunal
    also heard evidence that the appellant’s ex-husband did not have benefits
    with his employment and, to ensure that the children had appropriate medical
    coverage, the Tribunal ordered 100 per cent medical coverage through the
    ODSP twelve months of the year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    relation to the claim for basic needs, the Tribunal was required to determine
    whether the three children were “dependent children” and part of the mother’s “benefit
    unit”. The Tribunal found that the Appellant did not have sole responsibility
    to feed and clothe her children as well as provide for their basic necessities
    full time.  In addition, the Tribunal noted that, pursuant to the parties’ separation
    agreement, all costs incurred while the children are in one parent’s care
    are to be borne solely by that parent. Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered
    that, “The Appellant is entitled to half of the children’s basic needs allowance
    each and every month.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appealed the Tribunal’s decision respecting the basic needs component
    of income support to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  The Director did not cross-appeal the Tribunal’s decision
    respecting the shelter and benefit components of income support.  The

    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court saw no error in the Tribunal’s conclusion on the basic needs

    Divisional Court’s conclusion and would dismiss this appeal. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal position is that there is no authority in the ODSP
    Act or the regulations to find that a child is a
    “dependent” only part of the time.  A child is either dependent or not and,
    since the children are clearly dependent on the appellant half the time,
    she is entitled to the full basic needs allowance on their behalf. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this position, the appellant relies on the decision of the Tribunal,
    which it suggests “implicitly” found the children to be “dependent children” twelve
    months of the year.  By awarding a year-round shelter and benefits allowance
    for the appellant and her three children, the Tribunal clearly determined
    that the children were included in her benefit unit year-round, and were
    therefore her “dependent children” for the entire year.  The appellant argues
    that this finding should have also extended to the basic needs determination.  There
    is no residual discretion for the Director to make individualized adjustments
    or deductions other than the amount provided for in the regulation once determining
    that the children satisfied the definition of “dependent”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    the appellant submits that, even if a child could be found to be a “dependent” fifty
    per cent of the time, there is no mechanism in the Act or regulations for
    calculating income support based on the amount of time a child is “dependent” within
    a one month period.  In support of this position, the appellant emphasizes
    that the Tribunal is a creature of statute and can only act with the express
    authorization of its enabling statute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of whether the appellant’s children are “dependent children” and
    part of her benefit unit is guided by Ontario Regulation 222/98 to the ODSP
    Act, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>s. 1(1)  For the purposes of this Act and the regulations,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“child” means
    a person under 18 years of age;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“dependant”,
    in relation to an applicant or recipient means,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) a person who resides in the same dwelling place and who is,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(ii) a dependent child of the applicant or recipient….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>s. 2(3)<b>  </b>For the purposes of the Act and the regulations, a child
    is a dependent child, in relation to an applicant or recipient, if,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c) the
    applicant or recipient or the spouse included in the benefit unit,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(i) receives
    the Canada Child Tax Benefit under section 122.61 of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> (Canada)
    on behalf of the child or a determination has been made under that Act that
    he or she is eligible to receive the Canada Child Tax Benefit, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(ii) is
    the parent with primary care and control of the child, if subclause (i) does
    not apply;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 2(3)(c)(i), whether a child is a dependant child in relation to a recipient
    is linked to whether the recipient receives the Canada Child Tax Benefit
    (CCTB) or a determination has been made under the <i>Income Tax Act </i>that
    she is eligible to receive it. The CCTB is a monthly payment provided by
    the federal government to financially eligible families to help with the
    cost of raising children under eighteen years of age.  It consists of a basic
    benefit, and, depending on income, may include the National Child Benefit
    Supplement. If subsection 2(3)(c)(i) does not apply, then resort may be had
    to subclause (ii), and a determination is required as to whether the applicant
    is the parent with primary care and control of the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant receives CCTB six months of the year (January to June) and her
    ex-husband receives CCTB for the other six months. Therefore, for half of
    the year the appellant unquestionably qualifies as having dependent children
    under s. 2(3)(c)(i). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that for the other half of the year, when she is not receiving
    the CCTB, she is still eligible to receive the CCTB in accordance with s.
    2(3)(c)(i).  Alternatively, it is her position that she, “is the parent with
    primary care and control” of the children, thereby satisfying the criteria
    in accordance with s. 2(3)(c)(ii).  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>Eligibility for CCTB throughout the year</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s submission that when she is not receiving the CCTB she is nevertheless
    eligible to receive it is not supported by the wording of the relevant legislation.  Subclause
    2(3)(c)(i) refers to s. 122.61 of the <i>Income Tax Act, </i>which, in turn,
    defines “eligible individual” under s. 122.6.  The relevant portion of the
    definition of an “eligible individual” is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“eligible individual” in
    respect of a qualified dependant at any time means a person who <i>at that
    time</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) resides
    with the qualified dependant,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) is the
    parent of the qualified dependant who <i>primarily fulfills the responsibility
    for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant</i>, [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant shares custody with her spouse on an alternating week basis.  Therefore,
    it cannot be said that she primarily fulfills “the responsibility for the
    care and upbringing” of the children.  Rather, as noted by the Tribunal,
    the appellant “had primary care and control of the children 50% of the time”.  In
    addition, faced with the equal care and control situation, the Canada Revenue
    Agency made a determination that the appellant and her ex-husband were eligible
    to receive the CCTB for only <i>half </i>of the year.  A parent, such as
    the appellant, who asserts that she in fact has primary responsibility for
    the care of children does have a right to challenge the CCRA conclusion of
    equal parental responsibility and if successful, would then be eligible to
    receive the CCTB throughout the year.  I would therefore reject the appellant’s
    submission that she meets the requirements of s. 2(3)(c)(i) on a year round
    basis. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>“Primary care and control” of the children</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the Tribunal held she is a<b> </b>parent with primary
    care and control of her children at least fifty per cent of the time in any
    month when she was not in receipt of the CCTB, and that this suffices for
    the purposes of the section.  The Tribunal found: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Having considered
    all of the evidence the Tribunal determines that the Appellant is not the
    only parent with primary care and control of the children for any given month
    during which she is not entitled to the Child Tax Benefit as primary care
    and control is also assumed by the children’s father every other week. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument presumes that eligibility under s. 3(c)(ii) can be resorted to notwithstanding
    the fact that CCTB has been determined and allocated between the parents
    under s. 3(c)(i).  This interpretation does not appear to accord with the
    plain wording of s. 3(c)(ii) which states that that subsection only applies “if
    subclause (i) does not apply”.  However, we will nevertheless assume subclause
    (ii) applies and deal with the argument on its merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “primary care and control” is not defined in the ODSP Act or its regulations.  Principles
    of statutory interpretation must be applied to determine its true meaning.  The
    prevailing approach to statutory interpretation is that “the words of an
    Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and
    the intention of Parliament.”&nbsp; See R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger
    on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4th ed. (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths,
    2002) at p. 1;<i> Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>,<i> </i>[2002]<i> </i><span
style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>2 S.C.R. 559 </span>at para. 26. The ordinary meaning
    of legislation is “the natural meaning which appears when the provision is
    simply read through”.&nbsp; See Sullivan, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at p. 21; <i>Canadian
    Pacific Air Lines Ltd. v. Canadian Air Line Pilots Assn.</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R.
    724 at 735.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    natural meaning of the phrase, “the parent with primary care and control” requires
    a determination of which of the parents has the primary care and control
    in a given month.  This interpretation is derived from the use of the definite
    article <i>the</i>,<b> </b>as opposed to the indefinite article <i>a</i>,<b> </b>coupled
    with the word <i>primary</i>. My interpretation is supported by the equally
    authoritative French version which speaks of a determination as to whether
    the father or mother is the parent with primary care and control. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    tribunal was therefore faced with the same issue as Revenue
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in that a 50-50 sharing of custody was not contemplated by the regulation.</p>

    take their meaning from the context in which they are found.&nbsp; Thus,
    in interpreting a statutory provision, among the considerations to which
    the court will have regard are the way in which the Act operates, its purpose,
    history and other external sources.&nbsp; See Sullivan, <i>supra, </i>at

    purposes of the ODSP Act are set out in s. 1.  They include the recognition
    that persons with disabilities who have dependants need to be <i>effectively </i>served.  The
    Tribunal recognized that the appellant would not be served effectively if
    shelter costs for her children were met only part of the year because she
    had to pay for shelter for them twelve months of the year. Her shelter cost
    was constant. By contrast, food is a variable cost. Variation of the full
    allowance would not therefore violate the purpose of effective service to
    the appellant.  The purposes of the Act also include accountability to the
    taxpayers of
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    Ontario <i>Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. H.19.  Bastarache J. noted
    at para. 26, “[t]he presumption that a tribunal can go beyond its enabling
    statute … exists because it is undesirable for a tribunal to limit itself
    to some of the law while shutting its eyes to the rest of the law.”  </p>

    addition, Bastarache J. held at para. 40 that, in deciding a question of
    law, such as whether an applicant is eligible for income support, “the SBT
    is presumed able to consider any legal source that might influence its decision
    on eligibility.” Thus, when an enabling statute is silent on an issue, a <span lang=EN>tribunal
    may look beyond its enabling statute to other legal sources.  Other legal
    sources would include the common law.  In <i>Contino v. Leonelli-Contino</i>,<i> </i>[2005]
    3 S.C.R. 217 at para. 54 of its reasons,<i> </i>the Supreme Court cited Professor
    Rogerson to the effect that the majority of child-related costs, such as
    housing, were fixed and that any savings would typically be with respect
    to the smaller category of variable expenses such as food.  These comments
    apply equally to joint custody. The category of expenditures to which the
    basic needs portion of income support relates are variable costs such as
    food. </span></p>

    situations where a recipient of income support is a co-resident, is incarcerated
    or in hospital, the amount of income support paid is proportionately reduced.
    See O.Reg. 222/98, ss. 17, 35, 36.  Thus, the intention of the legislation
    is to account for the realities of a given situation.  The appellant submits,
    however, that the prescribed deductions are the only ones permitted by the
    Act and Regulation, and the Tribunal had no choice but to order payment of
    100 per cent of basic needs throughout the year.   </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    forgotten that the relationship in question here is not a traditional bipartite
    relationship but a tripartite one in which one party is the employee and
    the other two share the usual attributes of an employer.  In such a situation,
    it is natural that labour legislation designed to govern bipartite situations
    must be adjusted in some ways.</p>

    too, here, the relationship in question is not a traditional one in which

    share the attributes of custody equally. In such a situation, it is natural

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Unfortunately,
    tribunals and courts must often make decisions by interpreting statutes in
    which there are gaps.… When faced with such legislative gaps, tribunals have
    used their expertise to interpret the often terse provisions of the statute.  In
    the final analysis, however, it is up to the legislature to remedy those
    gaps.  The Court cannot encroach on an area where it does not belong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in this case, the Tribunal had to make a decision as to eligibility for the
    legislative scheme to operate. The Tribunal acted with flexibility and fairness
    to ensure that the appellant’s economic reality and particular circumstances
    were properly taken into account in determining her eligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Act and Regulation contain no mechanism for calculating income support on
    anything other than a monthly basis. The same result would, however, be achieved
    by paying the full basic needs component to the appellant when she is in
    receipt of the CCTB for six months and nothing afterwards when she is not
    incurring this variable cost and is not eligible for CCTB. Providing half
    of basic needs to the appellant throughout the year makes her income more
    consistent and does not affect the overall result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording of s. 2(3) does not specifically envisage the increasingly popular
    option of joint custody.  In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that
    the Tribunal had jurisdiction to make the order it did and, indeed, the respondent
    supports this interpretation.  After analyzing the legislation, I conclude
    that there is a basis for the Tribunal’s decision to order payment of fifty
    per cent of the amount of the basic needs component of income support in
    the Act and the Regulation, and the Tribunal’s conclusion does not constitute
    an error of law.</p>

    the alternative the appellant submits that the Tribunal’s finding that she
    has primary care and control of the children fifty per cent of the time and
    not more “ignores the evidence” and thus is an error in law. The appellant’s
    submission that she has primary care and control of the children more than
    fifty per cent of the time is based on her evidence that during the weeks
    when the children are residing with their father she still takes them to
    recreational activities and doctor’s appointments.  </p>

    disagree with this alternative submission.  The Tribunal referred to the
    appellant’s evidence and did not ignore it. The Tribunal chose, however,
    to rely on the wording of the parties’ separation agreement. On an appeal
    on a pure question of law, the task of the court is not to second guess the

    Ontario <i>Human Rights Code</i>, because it discriminates against her on
    the basis of “family status”.  The appellant submits that she receives unequal
    treatment “because of” her family status since it flows directly from the
    custody arrangements she has with her ex-husband.  She argues that her poverty
    is exacerbated by this arrangement and the Tribunal’s interpretation is a
    disincentive to enter into a custodial arrangement that is in the best interests
    of her children.  </p>

    <st1:State w:st="on">

    evidence was led or argument addressed to this issue.  While this Court maintains
    the discretion to consider arguments not raised in the processes below, I
    am not certain that such is appropriate in this context, where the respondent
    did not have a fair opportunity to defend the legislation by presenting oral
    and documentary evidence on it before the Tribunal.</p>

    any event, in arguing that she is being treated unequally on the basis of
    family status, the appellant appears to be comparing herself to parents with
    sole custody whose circumstances are different than parents with joint custody.
    Parents with sole custody have the children with them the full month or the
    majority of the month, rather than half the month.  This distinction is significant.  To
    suggest that these two distinct groups should receive the same treatment
    is inappropriate.  While a parent with joint custody must maintain a residence
    for the children all of the time, and therefore practical equality requires
    that the parent receive the full shelter component, the same is not true
    for basic needs.  Half of the child’s basic needs would arise while with
    each parent, therefore, paying half of the basic needs produces an equal
    result in comparison with children who are not in equally split joint custody
    arrangements.  As such, I would reject the appellant’s submission that the
