    principal ground of appeal raised in this case concerns the admissibility
    of a conversation between the appellant and his co-accused while the two
    of them were being held in custody after their arrest.  The appellant was
    tried for various offences, the most serious relating to a home invasion.
    At trial, the appellant and his co-accused challenged the admissibility of
    the conversation on the basis that their rights under the <i>Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i> had been infringed.  Finnestad J. found that there was no
    infringement of s. 7 and that ruling is no longer challenged.  However, the
    appellant argues that his s. 10(b) rights were also infringed and that this
    stood as an independent ground for excluding the conversation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not deal with the admissibility of the conversation in relation
    to s. 10(b), perhaps because most of the submissions were focused on the
    s. 7 argument.  I am satisfied, however, that s. 10(b) was raised and that
    the appellant is not barred from relying on that provision in this court.  For
    the following reasons, I would give effect to that ground of appeal and allow
    the appeal in part.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    chronology of events is important to understanding the appellant’s principal
    ground of appeal.  Sometime before 4:00 a.m. on September 20, 2004, three
    masked men broke into the home of Emelio Giangrande and began to assault
    him.  Mr. Giangrande was able to flee the scene and call the police.  In
    the meantime, the perpetrators left the home.  The appellant and Giangrande
    knew each other because Giangrande’s girlfriend was the appellant’s former
    common law spouse.  There was some evidence of bad blood between the appellant
    and Giangrande.  While Giangrande purported to identify the appellant as
    one of his assailants, the trial judge held that this evidence was unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    short time after Giangrande escaped from his house, a police officer had
    reason to stop the appellant’s vehicle.  After a short police chase, during
    which items taken from the Giangrande home were thrown from the vehicle,
    the vehicle was stopped and the appellant and two companions were detained.  The
    appellant was arrested for dangerous driving at 4:16 a.m.  The vehicle was
    searched at the scene and a quantity of marijuana was found.  As a result,
    the appellant’s companions Carlos Silva and Edsel Barillas were arrested
    for possession of drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police soon realized the connection between the Giangrande home invasion
    and the appellant’s vehicle.  While they knew firearms were involved in the
    home invasion, they did not find any.  The appellant and his companions were
    taken back to the police station.  At that time, the appellant was only under
    arrest for dangerous driving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the appellant and Silva had been informed of their right to counsel upon
    arrest.  The appellant indicated a desire to speak to his lawyer on two occasions
    shortly after the arrest.  At 7:35 a.m. the appellant became aggressive with
    the investigating officers and he was returned to his cell where he again
    asked to speak to his lawyer.  The appellant was told he would not be allowed
    to make any calls at that time.  The reasons given by the police at trial
    for not allowing any conversation was that the appellant might contact someone
    who would pick up the missing gun and “officer safety” because the appellant
    had become aggressive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    9:05 a.m. the investigating officers had decided to charge the appellant
    in relation to the home invasions.  He was not, however, told of this change
    in circumstances until several hours later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the meantime, at 11:20 a.m., seven hours after the arrest, Silva was questioned
    about the location of the firearm.  He refused to tell the police anything.  After
    he returned to his cell Silva spoke to the appellant about the questioning
    and made incriminating remarks.  While the appellant’s responses were somewhat
    equivocal, they could be interpreted as implicating him in the home invasion.  The
    conversation was overheard by one of the investigating officers who took
    notes of the conversation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 11:45 a.m., the police again spoke to the appellant and told him that
    he was being charged with the robbery and firearms offences.  The officer
    did not attempt to question the appellant about the offences.  Finally, at
    1:20 p.m., over nine hours after his arrest, the appellant was allowed to
    use the telephone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    co-accused Silva challenged the admissibility of statements he made to the
    police on the basis of s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge found
    that Silva’s s. 10(b) rights had been violated.  In the course of that ruling
    she rejected the Crown’s submission that delay in giving Silva access to
    counsel was justified because of the ongoing investigation, including the
    problem of the missing firearm.  She said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I accept public
    safety, an ongoing investigation and preservation of evidence as valid reasons
    for the denial of other telephone calls <i>but there was no evidence given
    that would establish them as having any basis for the denial of the right
    to counsel</i>.  There is nothing in the statement taken by Detective Constable
    Baker which discloses an urgent need to further the investigation or to preserve
    evidence.  The questioning simply requests the chronology of the evening’s
    events.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge excluded Silva’s statements to the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge admitted the statements made by the appellant and Silva to
    each other in the cells.  Her reasons with respect to admissibility of the
    conversation dealt only with s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  She found that
    the remarks in the cells were not elicited by the police within the meaning
    of <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). She rejected the
    defence submission that the questioning of Silva and then returning him to
    the cells was a ploy to try and get the appellant and Silva to talk about
    the robbery.  She also noted that the appellant and Silva had both been told
    that areas of the police station were under surveillance.  Silva was re-advised
    of this only a short time before he was returned to the cells and had the
    incriminating conversation with the appellant.</p>

    the <i>Charter</i> and that the right to counsel issue was mentioned only
    in passing.  <span
lang=EN>This is not a case, however, where objection to the admissibility of
    evidence is raised for the first time on appeal. At trial, the appellant
    expressly argued that his statements were inadmissible because they were
    obtained in violation of the <i>Charter</i>.  There is no suggestion that
    the failure to expressly rely upon s. 10(b) was a tactical decision.  There
    is also no suggestion that the Crown was in any way prejudiced in the sense
    that different or additional evidence might have been called.  Both the Crown
    and defence relied upon the same evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>Further,
      counsel for the co-accused Silva expressly raised the violation of his
      client’s s. 10(b) rights as a basis for excluding the conversation in the
      cells.  In her reply submissions, counsel for the Crown at trial clearly
      assumed that s. 10(b) was a live issue with respect to both the accused
      in relation to the jail cell conversation.  Finally, in the course of submissions,
      the trial judge at one point summarized some of the <i>Charter</i> arguments
      and stated her understanding was that the accused were arguing that “the
      denial of the right to counsel was sufficient to taint the circumstances
      in which the otherwise admissible conversation between [the] two accused
      was held”.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    my view, the appellant’s right to counsel as guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> was
    infringed.  In <i>R. v. Manninen</i> (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 391-92,
    the Supreme Court of Canada held that s. 10(b) imposes at least two duties
    on the police in addition to the duty to inform the detainee of the right
    to counsel.  First, the police must provide the detainee with a reasonable
    opportunity to exercise the right to retain and instruct counsel without
    delay.  On the trial judge’s findings, the police did not carry out this
    duty.  She rejected the explanation that it was reasonable to withhold access
    to counsel because of the ongoing investigation.  Although that finding was
    made expressly in relation to the co-accused Silva, the appellant’s circumstances
    would not lead to a different result.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(c) <i>Police duty to cease questioning or otherwise attempting to

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that there was a further violation of s. 10(b) because
    the police failed to carry out the other duty recognized in <i>Manninen</i>:
    to “cease questioning or otherwise attempting to elicit evidence from the
    detainee until he has had a reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct
    counsel”.  The appellant relies on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. McKenzie</i> (2002),
    167 C.C.C. (3d) 530.  In that case, Moldaver J.A. found that while there
    was no direct questioning of the accused by the police, their conduct amounted
    to eliciting within the meaning of <i>Manninen</i>.  He provided this explanation
    of the word “elicit” at para. 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Although
      the word “elicit” does not lend itself to a short and precise meaning,
      I am of the view that the test to be applied is one which concentrates
      on the interchange between the police and the detainee with a view to determining
      whether, in all of the circumstances, there is a causal link between the
      conduct of the police and the making of the statement by the detainee.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moldaver
    J.A. went on to apply this test and found, at paras. 35-36, that the conduct
    in that case “amounted to the functional equivalent of an interrogation” and “constituted
    a form of manipulation which, even if unintended, had the effect of bringing
    about a mental state in which the appellant was more likely to talk”.  He
    therefore found that the accused’s rights had been infringed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Moldaver J.A. in <i>McKenzie </i>set out the broad test of asking whether
    there is a “causal link” between the police conduct and the making of the
    statement, it is apparent from the subsequent discussion that a causal link
    is not sufficient to constitute elicitation.  Rather, the court must have
    regard to a number of factors to decide the issue.  Thus, at para. 29, Moldaver
    J.A. refers to <i>R. v. Broyles</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C.(3d) 308, where the
    Supreme Court of Canada dealt with elicitation in the context of s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> and the use of police agents to obtain incriminating statements
    from a detainee.  In <i>Broyles</i> at p.&nbsp;321, Iacobucci J. listed several
    factors a court should consider in determining whether there was a causal
    link between the conduct of the state agent and the making of the statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      first set of factors concerns the nature of the exchange between the accused
      and the state agent. Did the state agent actively seek out information
      such that the exchange could be characterized as akin to an interrogation,
      or did he or she conduct his or her part of the conversation as someone
      in the role the accused believed the informer to be playing would ordinarily
      have done? <i>The focus should not be on the form of the conversation,
      but rather on whether the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional
      equivalent of an interrogation</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span lang=EN>The
        second set of factors concerns the nature of the relationship between
        the state agent and the accused. Did the state agent exploit any special
        characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement?</span></i><span lang=EN> Was
        there a relationship of trust between the state agent and the accused?
        Was the accused obligated or vulnerable to the state agent? <i>Did the
        state agent manipulate the accused to bring about a mental state in which
        the accused was more likely to talk</i>?  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Moldaver J.A. observed in <i>McKenzie</i> that these factors do not fit precisely

    regard to the findings of the trial judge in this case, I am satisfied that
    there was no elicitation.  The questioning of the co-accused Silva was done
    in good faith by the police in an attempt to locate a dangerous weapon and
    was not a ploy.  In those circumstances, although the police unquestionably
    hoped that Silva and the appellant might talk, at least about the weapon,
    it cannot be said that the conduct of the police in placing the two suspects
    in adjoining cells and deciding to attempt to overhear the conversation was
    the functional equivalent of an interrogation.  There was no special relationship
    between the police and Silva and the appellant.  Throughout, the appellant
    and Silva had an accurate perception of the situation, knowing that they
    were having a conversation in a jail after being warned that they were under
    surveillance.  The investigating officers did not attempt to manipulate the
    appellant in the sense referred to in <i>Broyles</i>.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while there was a breach of the appellant’s right to consult counsel, there
    was not a further breach of the duty of the police to refrain from attempting
    to elicit incriminating information before affording him the opportunity
    to consult counsel.  </p>

    view of the finding that the police breached the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights
    by not providing him with the opportunity to consult counsel without delay,
    it is necessary to consider whether the evidence should be excluded under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Since the trial judge did not deal with
    this aspect of s. 10(b), we do not have the benefit of her analysis of s.
    24(2).  However, I am satisfied that there is sufficient material in the
    record for this court to determine the s. 24(2) issue.  For the following
    reasons, I am satisfied that the evidence is inadmissible.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I have found that the police did not elicit the conversation in violation
    of s. 10(b), the conversation was “<span lang=EN>obtained in a manner</span>” that
    infringed the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights as that phrase was explained <i><span lang=EN>R.
    v. Strachan</span></i><span
lang=EN> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 479 (S.C.C.).  In most cases, a temporal connection
    will suffice to meet the “obtained in a manner” requirement.  Dickson C.J.C.
    approved the following characterization at p. 495:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      is sufficient if the infringement or denial of the right or freedom has
      preceded, or occurred in the course of, the obtaining of the evidence.

      obtained but for the violation of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a very close temporal connection between the violation that occurred in
    this case and the obtaining of the evidence.  In fact, the violation of the
    s. 10(b) right was a continuing one, as the appellant had repeatedly asserted
    his right to counsel.  Accordingly, it is necessary to apply the test set
    out in <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) as explained
    in <i><span lang=EN>R. v. Stillman</span></i><span

    first issue under the <i>Collins/Stillman</i> analysis is whether admissibility
    of the evidence would affect the fairness of the trial.  In the circumstances
    of this case, that depends upon whether the appellant was compelled or conscripted
    to incriminate himself.  In <i>Stillman</i>, Cory J. put the matter this
    way at para. 98:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Thus,
      it can be seen that the admission of evidence, which was obtained following
      the breach of an accused's <i>Charter</i> rights resulting in the accused
      being compelled or conscripted to incriminate himself by a statement or
      the use as evidence of his body or bodily substances will, as a general
      rule, be found to render the trial unfair.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    terms “compelled” and “conscripted” have been given broad meanings and do
    not require conduct amounting to coercion.  Thus, even a voluntary confession
    to a person in authority has been held to have been compelled or conscripted:
    see the discussion by Steel J.A. in <i>R. v. Dolynchuk</i> (2004), 184 C.C.C.
    (3d) 214 (Man. C.A.) at paras. 63-72.  On the other hand, cases such as <i>R.
    v. Fliss</i> (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Wijesinha</i> (1995),
    100 C.C.C.(3d) 410 (S.C.C.), have held that surreptitiously recorded conversations
    between an accused and an undercover officer are not compelled or conscripted
    where the accused is not detained at the time of the recording.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    without some hesitation, I am satisfied that although this appellant was
    detained at the time of his conversation with Silva, he was not compelled
    or conscripted into incriminating himself.  I make that finding based on
    the following circumstances:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span

    next set of <i>Collins</i> factors to consider are those dealing with the
    seriousness of the breach.  Courts have tended to deal with the seriousness
    of the breach by looking at the nature of the state conduct and the nature
    of the protected interest.  When dealing with the breach of s. 10(b) in relation
    to Silva’s statements to the police, the trial judge found that the delay
    in affording him his right to counsel could not be justified.  The same considerations
    apply to the appellant.  Thus, this violation of the appellant’s rights was
    not mitigated by urgency or necessity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was some suggestion that the delay was justifiable for reasons of officer
    safety because the appellant threatened one of the officers. I am unable
    to understand how this threat could justify denying the appellant, who was
    in custody, access to counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    violation of the appellant’s right to counsel was also not an isolated one.  In
    addition to the s. 10(b) violation, the police failed to comply with their
    duty under s. 10(a) to inform the appellant promptly of the reasons for his
    detention.  The police had decided to also charge the appellant in relation
    to the home invasion by at least 9:05 a.m., but they did not inform the appellant
    of the true nature of his jeopardy until 11:45 a.m., after his conversation
    with Silva.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Somewhat
    mitigating the seriousness of the violation is that the conversation took
    place in a cell block, where there is a reduced expectation of privacy.  Further,
    as was noted in <i>Fliss</i> at para. 85, the appellant’s act of volunteering
    these statements indicates a low expectation of privacy.  That said, this
    was a serious violation of the right to counsel.  The appellant asserted
    his right repeatedly, and the purpose of the right to counsel is to give
    the detainee an opportunity to obtain information as to how to exercise the
    right to silence.  It is reasonable to assume that competent counsel would
    have advised the appellant that he should not speak to other prisoners, even
    his companion Silva.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(d) <i>Repute of the administration of justice</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    third set of <i>Collins </i>factors consider whether exclusion of the evidence
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  These were serious
    offences.  On the other hand, this conversation was not a crucial element
    of the Crown’s case.  Even without the conversation, the Crown had a strong
    circumstantial case.  The appellant was known to the victim, he had a motive
    to commit the offence, and he was found in possession of some of the victim’s
    goods.  In addition, his manner of driving and the attempt by him or his
    companions to dispose of the goods from the car was compelling evidence of
    consciousness of guilt.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    this violation strikes at core values underlying the administration of justice:
    the right to advice from counsel within a reasonable time so as to exercise
    the right to silence with knowledge of one’s real jeopardy.  On balance,
    it seems to me that the administration of justice would be brought into greater
    disrepute if the evidence was admitted, notwithstanding I have found that
    its admission would not affect the fairness of the trial.</p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecution case was very strong.  However, since the trial judge was not
    prepared to rely upon the identification evidence from the victim, the case
    turned on circumstantial evidence including any inferences that could be
    drawn from the police cell conversation.  The trial judge made reference
    to that conversation in finding that the Crown had established a strong circumstantial
    case.  More importantly, Crown counsel made very effective use of that conversation
    in cross-examining the appellant.  Had that conversation been excluded at
    trial it would not have been available to the Crown for that purpose: see <i>R.
    v. Calder</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  </p>

    am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case to apply the proviso in
    s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, as it is possible that a trier
    of fact would have a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt if the
    evidence in question were removed from his or her consideration: see <i>Broyles
    v. The Queen</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) at 328.</p>

    appellant’s other ground of appeal concerns the application of the rule in <i>Browne
    v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.).  In view of my conclusion on the <i>Charter </i>issue,
    it is not strictly necessary to deal with this issue and I will only make
    brief comments.  The appellant argues that the trial judge was in error in
    finding that much of the appellant’s story was never put to Crown witnesses
    and, in any event, she ought not to have applied the rule in the circumstances.  I
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence because it appeared contrived
    and was inconsistent with the circumstantial case, including the jail cell
    conversation.  A review of the appellant’s testimony supports that view.  The
    appellant would add new facts as he was questioned, especially in cross-examination.  The
    rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> played a relatively minor part in the trial
    judge’s reasoning.  I am satisfied that the trial judge did not misapply
    that rule.</p>
