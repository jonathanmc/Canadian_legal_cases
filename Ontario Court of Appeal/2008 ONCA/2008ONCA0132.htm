    Ontario limited partnerships formed to participate in tax sheltered investments
    in film and television productions with non-resident film studios. Believing
    that certain fees payable under the agreements with the non-resident studios
    were deductible, the appellants deducted the amount of the payments to the
    non-residents from their income tax, and withheld and remitted to the Canada
    Revenue Agency (CRA) on behalf of the non-residents the applicable withholding
    tax relative to the payments, as required by Part XIII of the <i>Income Tax
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.), c.1.</p>

    CRA reassessed the appellants by denying that a portion of the payments to
    the non-residents was deductible in the hands of the appellants. Under Part
    XIII, if the payment is not deductible in the hands of the resident partnership,
    then no withholding tax is owed or payable by or on behalf of the non-residents.</p>

    CRA moved under Rule 21 to have the action dismissed as a matter of law and
    for lack of jurisdiction. The motion judge agreed. She held that there can
    be no action in unjust enrichment by the appellants. Although the amounts
    were remitted by the appellants, the remittances were made on behalf of the
    non-residents. Consequently, only the non-residents are owed any monies by
    the CRA.  She also found there was a juristic reason for the original payment.
    On the jurisdiction issue, the motion judge held that the Act provides a
    complete procedural code for the recovery of any overpaid or wrongly paid
    withholding tax. </p>

    non-resident is only liable for Part XIII withholding tax under s. 212(1)
    if it receives certain payments from a “person resident in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”. A partnership is deemed to be a “person resident in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ” under s. 212(13.1) if the payments it makes to a non-resident are deductible.
    In this case, the appellants initially believed the payments they made to
    the non-residents were deductible, having earlier obtained a ruling from
    CRA to that effect.  After the appellants had remitted the withholding tax
    on those payments, CRA ruled that a portion of the payments was not deductible.
    Consequently, the appellants were not “persons resident in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
  ” in respect of those payments and no withholding tax was owed by the non-residents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement between the appellants and the non-residents contained a “gross-up” clause
    that required the appellants to gross up the payments it owed them by a sufficient
    amount so that once the tax was withheld and paid, the non-residents received
    the net amount they bargained for with no deduction for Canadian taxes. The
    effect of the gross-up clause was that the appellants effectively absorbed
    the non-residents’ liability for Canadian withholding tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the payments the appellants made to the non-residents were reassessed as
    non-deductible under the Act, the non-residents were not liable for the withholding
    tax that the appellants had already paid. However, the non-residents suffered
    no deprivation because of the gross-up clause. Rather, it is the appellants
    who have suffered a deprivation because they paid the tax on behalf of the
    non-residents out of their own pocket. The non-residents have not applied
    for a refund because they are not out of pocket any monies. It is the appellants
    who seek a refund from CRA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as the motion judge found, the gross-up clause is a private arrangement between
    the parties and does not affect their legal relationship with CRA, which
    is governed by the Act. The Act provides that the liability for tax is the
    non-residents’, while the duty to remit is the appellants’. Consequently,
    even though it is the appellants who may have suffered the deprivation, and
    it is the CRA that has been unjustly enriched, under the Act, it is only
    the non-residents to whom the respondent owes any overpayment of withholding
    tax. The appellants can have no action against CRA.  Because of this finding,
    there is no need to address the second part of the unjust enrichment test,
    absence of juristic reason.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue
      2: Does Part XIII of the Act provide a complete procedural code?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that because Part XIII of the Act only provides a remedy
    in  s. 227(6) for non-residents, there is a gap in the Act in terms of a
    remedy for the appellants who paid the tax in accordance with the gross-up
    clause and are the ones who actually suffered the deprivation as a result.
    The appellants also point to CRA Information Circular 75-6R2 that recognizes
    the existence of
    “gross-up” clauses in agreements with non-residents and mandates how withholding
    tax is to be calculated on those grossed up payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the fact that a remedy is provided only for non-residents is consistent with
    the scheme of Part XIII. As discussed above, CRA owes any overpayment only
    to the non-resident. Section 227(6) provides that where either the non-resident
    was not liable for withholding tax or an overpayment was made on the non-resident’s
    behalf, it is the non-resident who has the remedy against CRA.  Furthermore,
    if the non-resident disputes the remedy provided by CRA, ss. 227(7), 165
    and 169 of the Act provide that an appeal lies to the Tax Court of Canada,
    not to the Superior Court of a province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would appear that if the person resident in Canada who is obliged to withhold
    and remit to CRA wants the ability to claim a refund from CRA in case of
    an incorrect or over payment, it must have an assignment or other legal arrangement
    with the non-resident that allows the resident to assert the non-resident’s
    rights. Without such an arrangement, no one other than the non-resident is
    owed a remedy; therefore there is no gap in Part XIII.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge that Part XIII of the Act provides a complete
    procedural code for the return of non-resident withholding taxes whether
    paid under mistake or where there was no liability for the tax. Sections
    165 and 169 of the Act provide that if any application is to be made to court,
    it is to the Tax Court of Canada, not to the Superior Court of a province.</p>
