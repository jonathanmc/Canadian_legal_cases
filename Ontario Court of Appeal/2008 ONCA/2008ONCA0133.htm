    appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault and from the sentence
    of three years imprisonment.  At the conclusion of oral argument we indicated
    that the appeal was dismissed for reasons to follow.  These are those reasons.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Section

    application for a stay of proceedings was heard by Speyer J. as a pre-trial
    motion.  While there had been a lengthy period from when the appellant was
    charged in October 2001, the only serious complaint concerned the period
    following the declaration of a mistrial, because of a hung jury, in February
    2004.  Unfortunately, the case was not reached on September 24, 2004, the
    date set for the retrial.  The court was able to offer new trial dates in
    November 2004, but defence counsel was unavailable.  Because of defence counsel’s
    commitments, the trial could not proceed until March 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge considered most of the time from the declaration of the mistrial
    until the new trial date as neutral.  While we agree with the appellant that
    some part of that period could be considered institutional delay, in particular
    the period from September 24 until November, we are satisfied that the motion
    judge’s conclusion that there was no violation of s. 11(b) was correct.  We
    are not unsympathetic to the position of busy counsel who because of commitments,
    including commitments as a result of the “blitz court” in the Ontario Court
    of Justice, is unable to reschedule a two week trial immediately.  However,
    the dates suggested by the trial court for the new trial date were not unrealistic.  We
    agree with the motion judge when he said:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[W]hile an accused
    has a right to counsel of choice and that counsel is unavailable because
    of prior trial commitments, it is wrong to attribute delay to the system
    when, in fact, the system could have accommodated an expeditious trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge properly balanced the relevant factors including the public
    interest in the trial on the merits of a serious allegation of sexual assault.  We
    also agree with the motion judge that there was an absence of actual prejudice
    over and above the prejudice that may be inferred from the delay itself.  The
    specific prejudice referred to in the appellant’s affidavit arose from the
    fact that charges were laid and that two trials were necessary, not from
    institutional delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, we consider it unfortunate that this matter was not reached on
    the first trial date following the mistrial due to a lack of judicial resources.
    However, the total institutional delay in this matter was approximately twenty-three
    months.  While this period of delay is somewhat in excess of the <i>Morin</i> guideline,
    it is important to note that the <i>Morin</i> guideline is simply that a
    guideline—it is not a fixed limitation period to be applied in a mechanical
    way. Taking account of all of the circumstances in this case, including the
    important factors that it involved a two week trial and that a second trial
    was necessary because of a hung jury, we are not persuaded that the total
    institutional delay was unreasonable. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Bad
      Character Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    rightly concedes that the complainant was properly allowed to refer to the
    acts of violence in the household, especially against the complainant’s mother,
    since this evidence would assist the jury in understanding why the complainant
    delayed in reporting the abuse.  The appellant submits, however, that the
    trial judge, Van Melle J., erred in permitting the Crown to lead evidence
    of the proceedings at the appellant’s guilty plea for assaulting the complainant’s
    mother.  We are satisfied that the trial judge did not err in admitting this
    evidence.  The trial judge severely limited the amount of evidence that she
    would permit to be led to show the acts of violence in the home.  For example,
    she would not permit the mother and another witness to testify about the
    violence and confirm the complainant’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proceedings at the appellant’s guilty plea, however, were independent evidence
    that confirmed the complainant’s testimony and it related to an event that
    occurred when the sexual assaults were allegedly occurring.  The evidence
    was thus highly probative on the issue of delay in reporting.  Further, given
    the other evidence testified to by the complainant, which was admittedly
    properly admitted, the guilty plea proceedings were of relatively limited
    prejudicial effect.  Further, excluding the evidence of the conviction would
    have left the jury with an incomplete and potentially misleading picture.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility
      of the s. 715.1 Statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    trial judge permitted Crown counsel to introduce a video taped statement
    made by the police of an interview of the complainant pursuant to s. 715.1
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The statement was taken within days of the
    complaint to the police.  In the statement itself, the complainant recounts
    sexual abuse by the appellant that ended when she was twelve years of age,
    or three years before the complaint.  However, as trial counsel acknowledged
    in his submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, at the preliminary inquiry, the
    complainant recounted further abuse by the appellant that lasted until a
    few months before the complaint.  As such, trial counsel’s main argument
    did not focus on whether the videotape was made within a reasonable time.  Rather,
    his submissions largely concerned whether the video taped statement was necessary,
    given the complainant’s fairly good memory of the events.  On appeal, however,
    Mr. Datt, who was not trial counsel, submits that the videotape was not made
    within a reasonable time after the alleged event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    account of all of the circumstances in this case, including the fact that
    defence counsel at trial acknowledged that the complainant had previously
    given evidence that the alleged abuse continued past her twelfth birthday,
    the age of the complainant when she made the video statement, the difficulties
    she experienced in giving her evidence, and the reasons for the delay in
    reporting including the complainant’s continuing relationship with the appellant
    and her half-brothers, in our view, it was open to the trial judge to permit
    the complainant to adopt the video statement pursuant to s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle in taking into
    account the appellant’s lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance.  The
    trial judge’s reasons on this issue are at least ambiguous and we have therefore
    proceeded on the basis that there was an error in principle.  Accordingly,
    it is open to this court to consider the fitness of the sentence without
    regard to the usual deference paid to sentencing decisions.  However, in
    our view the three-year sentence was not unfit.  This was manifestly not
    a case for a conditional sentence.  The appellant, who was in a position
    of trust with the complainant, repeatedly sexually assaulted her from when
    she was nine years of age.  The assaults included attempted sexual intercourse
    and caused some physical injury as well as serious emotional trauma.  The
    appellant, as noted, had a prior record for assault.  Notwithstanding the
    lengthy period that the appellant has been on bail, without incident, we
    are satisfied that a penitentiary sentence was required.  The terms of the
    bail were not particularly stringent and were modified within months of being
    imposed to permit the appellant to resume a relationship with his new family.</p>
