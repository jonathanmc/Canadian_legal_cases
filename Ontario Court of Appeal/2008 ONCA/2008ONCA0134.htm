    October 30, 1997, the applicant, Timothy Garland, was designated a dangerous
    offender and sentenced to an indeterminate term in the penitentiary. He now
    seeks leave to extend the time for serving and filing a notice of appeal
    against his sentence.</p>

    criteria the applicant must establish to obtain the extension are well established:

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">

    ). </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    must show that he had a <i>bona fide</i> intention to appeal his sentence
    within the appeal period;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    must account for or explain the delay in bringing his motion to extend the
    time; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    must show that his proposed appeal has merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    criteria do not amount to a rigid test. In considering them the court should
    grant the extension if the interests of justice warrant doing so. The Crown
    acknowledges that Mr. Garland has met the first two criteria. The Crown submits,
    however, that I should refuse the extension because the appeal has no merit
    and the Crown would be prejudiced if the extension were granted. I do not
    accept the Crown’s submission. I have concluded that Mr. Garland has met
    all three criteria and has shown that the interests of justice warrant the
    extension that he seeks.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         <i>Bona
        Fide</i> Intention to Appeal within the Thirty-Day Appeal Period.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Garland took two steps that show he had a <i>bona fide</i> intention to
      appeal within the appeal period. First, the day he was sentenced, he told
      his lawyer he wanted to appeal the dangerous offender designation. Second,
      less than two weeks later, and still within the appeal period, Mr. Garland
      completed an application to Legal Aid for an opinion on the merits of an
      appeal against sentence. Therefore he has satisfied the first criterion. </span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Explanation

      delay is lengthy – ten years. In my view, however, Mr. Garland has satisfactorily
      accounted for it. The explanation lies in the conduct of his lawyers. He
      had several lawyers over the period though he did not instigate any of
      the changes of solicitor. Whether by reason of negligence, incompetence,
      or worse, his lawyers misled him and let him down terribly. This is the
      chronology of what happened. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Garland’s first lawyer, who acted for him at the dangerous offender hearing
      and until at least November 2000, represented in correspondence to Mr.
      Garland that he would deliver an opinion letter and notice of appeal to
      the Legal Aid Committee and would appear before that committee. The lawyer’s
      itemized account to Legal Aid shows that he did not write an opinion letter
      or prepare a notice of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span

      Garland’s next lawyer did write an opinion letter for Legal Aid in which
      he said the appeal had merit. However, apparently he was too busy to carry
      on with the file. In late 2004 he transferred the file and the legal aid
      certificate authorizing an appeal to a third lawyer, who returned the file
      a few months later as she was no longer practising law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      2005 Mr. Garland’s file ended up with a fourth lawyer who, apart from meeting
      with Mr. Garland, did nothing on the file for nearly two years. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      and fortuitously for Mr. Garland, Ms. Kingston took over the file in 2007.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      this chronology demonstrates, Mr. Garland’s file has languished for ten
      years, not because of his conduct, but because of the conduct of his lawyers.
      The Crown accepts this, but suggests that Mr. Garland’s remedy lies with
      a complaint against his lawyers to the Law Society. The relief that might
      flow from such a complaint strikes me as a hollow remedy for a man sitting
      in jail who merely wants an opportunity to appeal his indeterminate sentence. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown argues that I should not grant the extension for two reasons: (1)

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      merit of Mr. Garland’s appeal rests on a so-called “<i>Johnson</i> error”.
      See <i>R. v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357.  This error arises when
      a trial judge fails to take account of the less harsh long-term offender
      provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> before declaring an offender dangerous
      and imposing an indeterminate sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      long-term offender provisions came into force a few months before Mr.&nbsp;Garland
      was sentenced. The trial judge did not consider them. He therefore erred.
      The Crown accepts that he erred and for that reason does not contend that
      Mr. Garland’s appeal is frivolous. However, the Crown argues that the trial
      judge’s error was harmless.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown points to the record showing that Mr.&nbsp;Garland is a pedophile
      with incurable personality disorders. The Crown also says that on a fair
      reading of his reasons on sentence, the trial judge concluded that Mr.
      Garland could not be controlled in the community. Thus the Crown argues,
      even if the trial judge had considered the long-term offender provisions,
      he would not have declared Mr.&nbsp;Garland a long-term offender because
      Mr. Garland could never be effectively supervised in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      I have said, I do not accept the Crown’s argument. The appeal is not hopeless.
      At least one passage from the trial judge’s reasons suggests that he might
      have viewed Mr. Garland’s sentence differently had he considered the long-term
      offender provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. At p. 62 of his reasons
      the trial judge observed that he might not have imposed an indeterminate
      sentence if Mr. Garland could be controlled:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I think, however, it might be a basis for exercising my discretion
      in not imposing a sentence of indefinite detention if he were able to be
      controlled. However, the length of time I could control him, short of indefinite
      detention, is limited, other than assuming the period of probation I could
      put him on would be three years at the most. If I were to impose a conditional
      sentence the limit would be two years less a day. Subject to, of course,
      assuming that he would continually breach his probation like he has in
      the past, which would result in further piecemeal definite sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>There is a limit to the amount of time I could control him and it
      is quite apparent to me on the evidence I have heard that this is a life
      long disorder. Both is paedophilia and his personality disorder are life
      long and cannot be cured. The most that could happen would be that they
      might be controlled.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      long-term offender provisions gave the trial judge “the control” he thought
      he lacked at the time of sentencing. Admittedly, other passages in the
      trial judge’s reasons suggest that he doubted Mr. Garland could ever be
      controlled. Nonetheless, Mr. Garland does have an arguable ground of appeal.
      Moreover, I think the court should err on the side of granting the extension
      as the need for it arose because of the conduct of Mr.&nbsp;Garland’s lawyers,
      and therefore the second of the three criteria weighs especially heavily
      in his favour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the question of prejudice, the Crown says that much of the voluminous record
      at the sentencing hearing, including the original exhibits, has been lost
      or destroyed. The Crown contends that, were this court to grant an extension,
      the unavailability of this material would prevent the Crown from effectively
      advocating for its position. I disagree. The transcripts and copies of
      the key medical reports are available. Thus, even if potential prejudice
      to the Crown were a legitimate basis to refuse an otherwise meritorious
      extension, I am not persuaded that the Crown has established prejudice
      in this case.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,

      conclude that the interests of justice favour allowing the requested extension
      of time. I grant the motion and extend the time for Mr. Garland to serve
      and file a notice of appeal against his sentence until 15 days after the
      release of these reasons.</span></p>
