'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Toronto Dominion Bank (“TD”) appeals from the order of Morawetz J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice granting summary judgment to the respondent, Juanita
    Monteiro, in the amount of US$712,879.42, plus prejudgment interest and costs.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juanita
    Monteiro is the daughter of Daisy and Sales Monteiro.  Both of her parents
    were residents of the State of Kuwait and are now deceased.  The amount awarded
    by the motion judge to Juanita - US$712,879.42 - represents monies held in
    a TD bank account in Daisy’s name (referred to here as “the funds”).  Daisy’s
    will, executed in 1989, specified that all properties owned by her at the
    time of her death, including her bank accounts, be transferred to Juanita. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    Daisy’s death in 1993, her sons, Joseph and Frank Monteiro, pursued lengthy
    estate litigation in the Kuwait courts in which they sought to invalidate
    the terms of their mother’s will.  They took the position, <i>inter alia</i>,
    that their mother held only a life interest in the funds according to the
    terms of the will of their father, Sales, who had predeceased Daisy.  TD
    was not a party to the estate litigation in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    and did not participate in the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    courts resolved the issue of the ownership of the TD account in favour of
    Juanita.  However, shortly after Daisy’s death and years before the estate
    litigation in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    was resolved, TD transferred the monies held in Daisy’s account to a Swiss
    bank account owned by Joseph.  TD completed this transfer pursuant to instructions
    it received from lawyers acting for Joseph.  In so doing, TD did not follow
    its own internal procedures for dealing with the account of a deceased customer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    seeking to overturn the motion judge’s decision in this case, TD submits
    that it should not be bound by the decision of the Kuwait courts on the issue
    of the ownership of the funds.  TD’s underlying argument is that it was not
    afforded an opportunity to participate in the Kuwait proceedings and consequently,
    it was denied its fundamental right to be heard.  TD argues that it was not “privy” to
    those proceedings such that it can be estopped from re-litigating the issues
    here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot accede to TD’s submissions and would dismiss the appeal for the reasons
    that follow.   </p>

lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daisy
    died in February 1993.   Her will, dated August 24, 1989, bequeathed all
    her properties, including her bank accounts, to Juanita.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 1993, TD transferred the funds in Daisy’s TD account to her son Joseph,
    who is since deceased.  The funds were wired into a bank account in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Switzerland</st1:country-region>
    in Joseph’s name.  TD performed this transfer based on directions it received
    from Joseph’s legal counsel in Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    transferring the funds to Joseph, TD did not request and was not provided
    with a copy of Daisy’s will.  Nor did TD make any inquiries concerning Daisy’s
    will.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    acting on the transfer request of Joseph’s counsel, TD did not follow its
    own internal written procedures for dealing with the account of a deceased
    customer.  These procedures required that the bank obtain information concerning
    the deceased, including the existence of a will or letters of administration.   TD’s
    internal written procedures included the following requirement: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A Notarial copy of the will should be retained
    on file to ensure the proper identity of the executor(s).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    TD did not notify Juanita of its proposed actions despite knowing of her
    involvement in the management of her mother’s account and knowing that she
    held a power of attorney in respect of that account.  Juanita did not learn
    that the funds from her mother’s TD account had been transferred to Joseph
    until 1997.   </p>

      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    against her brothers in which she sought to confirm the validity of her mother’s
    will.  The brothers took the position that Daisy’s 1989 will was not properly
    executed and that a will she executed in 1985 was the valid one.  The brothers
    also claimed that the property identified in Daisy’s 1989 will did not belong
    to her and that she was only entitled to a life estate in the assets in question
    pursuant to the terms of their father’s will.  The brothers asserted that,
    upon their mother’s death, any assets that she held flowed to them by operation
    of their father’s will. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    ’s Court of Cassation - Juanita brought a motion for summary judgment before

    reasons reported at (2004), 12 E.T.R. (3d) 50, the motion judge dismissed
    the motion on the basis that a genuine issue for trial existed with respect
    to the ownership of the TD bank account.  In particular, the motion judge
    held that the bank account in issue was not within the control of the State
    of Kuwait and therefore, the decision of the Kuwait Court of Appeal was not

    reasons on behalf of the court, Lane J. would have allowed the appeal and
    granted summary judgment if the only outstanding issue in the litigation
    was the issue of the ownership of the funds.  Lane J. was of the view that
    TD and the brothers had the same interest regarding the ownership of the
    funds, and hence, TD and the brothers were “privies” in the sense necessary
    to bind TD to the decision reached by the Kuwait Court of Appeal by way of
    the doctrine of issue estoppel.  </p>

    that there were “open issues”, including formal proof of the foreign judgment
    and the need to amend the pleadings to specifically plead that the plaintiff
    was proceeding on the basis of the foreign judgment.  Lane J. commented that
    once the pleadings were amended, the genuine issue for trial found to exist
    by the motion judge would “disappear as irrelevant” and that “[i]t would
    not be open to the TD to go behind the Kuwait judgment” (at para. 42).  </p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) Issues relating to property entitlement flow
    from Ms. Daisy Monteiro. This includes ownership of the TD Account, which

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) All parties who could have a proprietary interest

    right to the funds.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi) TD had knowledge of the Power of Attorney
    that had previously been granted by Ms. Daisy Monteiro to Ms. Juanita Monteiro.
    TD had knowledge of the death of Ms. Daisy Monteiro. TD did not obtain a
    copy of Ms. Daisy Monteiro's will before it paid the money to Mr. Joseph
    Monteiro. TD paid out the funds in the TD Account prematurely. TD released
    the funds prior to the determination of property rights in the funds.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vii) TD has no ownership rights in the TD Account

    motion judge rejected TD’s submissions that its defence had not been heard,
    noting at para. 22 that the flaw in the bank’s argument is that “TD has no
    independent defence”.  He went on to note at para. 24 that TD has “no independent
    proprietary right to the funds” distinct from that of the brothers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its factum submitted on the motion before Morawetz J., TD conceded that if
    it paid the funds to a person not entitled to them, then it is liable to
    the rightful owner regardless of how careful and diligent it was in making
    the payment to the person not entitled.  Based on TD’s concession that it
    had no available due diligence defence, the motion judge observed at para.
    26 that TD’s arguments amount to “nothing more than a request to re-litigate
    property rights that have already been determined in Kuwait in favour of
    Ms. Monteiro.  TD’s major complaint is that it does not like the result.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge adopted the

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    judgment was capable of raising issue estoppel against TD on the question
    of ownership of the money in the account.  Since the “open issues” referred

    that it was not open to TD to go behind the
    <st1:country-region

  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the motion judge err in relying on the <i>obiter</i> comments of the Divisional
    Court concerning issue estoppel?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    enumeration of several issues makes this case appear more complicated than
    it is.  All the arguments raised by TD are based on the underlying assumption
    that TD has some fundamental right to be involved in the estate litigation
    regarding the effect of the will of Daisy Monteiro.  In my view, this assumption
    is invalid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties to the estate litigation chose the Kuwait courts as the forum for
    the determination of the dispute surrounding the validity of Daisy’s will
    and to whom the assets referred to in it, including her bank accounts, were
    to be distributed. As noted by the motion judge, there is no sustainable
    argument that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    was not a proper forum:  it had a real and substantial connection to the
    dispute, not the least of which is the fact that Daisy was a resident of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    litigation was hotly contested and all routes of appeal were exhausted.  In
    the end result, the highest court in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    declared the transfer of Daisy’s assets to Juanita as valid and determined
    that Juanita was entitled to the funds in question.  On these facts, no one
    other than Juanita and her brothers could have an interest in the Kuwait
    litigation, save and except for some other person who might be claiming an
    ownership interest in some or all the assets of the estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a superficial analysis, this possibility might appear to ground an argument
    that TD had an ownership interest in one of the assets of the estate.  However,
    this argument cannot bear scrutiny.  The nature of the relationship between
    a depositor and a bank has long been recognized as one of contract: see M.H.
    Ogilvie, <i>Canadian Banking Law</i>, 2nd ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1998)
    at p. 498.  The bank is a contract debtor to the depositor.  The ownership
    of the money in the account rests with the bank once a deposit is made.  The
    asset of the depositor on the other hand, is the contract for the debt, or
    in other words, the obligation of the bank to repay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue decided in the estate litigation was the identity of the rightful
    owner of the contract of debt in relation to the TD bank account.   TD has
    no interest in that dispute.  Rather, in my view, TD is properly no more
    than a bystander who ought to be prepared to honour the obligation to the
    litigant who is found to be the rightful holder of its contract of debt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    view is reinforced by the manner in which the summary judgment motion was
    defended by TD.  TD does not point to any material evidence that was alleged
    to have not been before the courts in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    .  TD’s argument in the court below and in this court is essentially that
    it might have adduced the evidence in a different manner or argued the case
    differently.  In my opinion, TD’s position does not get it past the hurdle
    of establishing an interest in the estate litigation that is sufficient to
    ground an argument that it would be unfair to enforce the result in the Kuwait
    estate litigation to which TD was not a party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><a name="_Hlk188265456">[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
      reality, as recognized by both the Divisional Court on the first motion
      and the motion judge on the subsequent summary judgment motion, is that
      TD’s only interest in this case arises from its payment of the money from
      the account to the order of Joseph Monteiro without having properly verified
      the authority to give such direction. </a> In following the direction of
      Joseph Monteiro, TD also ignored the power of attorney held by Juanita
      Monteiro in respect of the account.  I agree with the motion judge that,
      in effect, TD is looking to turn its misconduct in the handling of the
      money in the account into an interest in the estate litigation that is
      sufficient to give it an opportunity to re-litigate the effect of the will
      in the faint hope of avoiding liability to Juanita Monteiro.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if a simple interest in the outcome of the estate litigation was sufficient
    to entitle TD to participate in that litigation, I would nevertheless find
    that, on the facts of this case, the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to
    prevent it from re-litigating the issue of ownership. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issue
    estoppel has been held to apply where the same question has been decided
    in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding
    between the same parties or their privies: see <i>Banque Nationale de Paris
    (Canada) v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 161
    (C.A.) at para. 16.  In my view, the motion judge, by adopting the reasoning
    of the Divisional Court on this issue, properly applied the doctrine of issue
    estoppel in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the validity and effect of Daisy’s will has already been decided
    in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    litigation.  The Supreme Court of Canada has held that for a foreign judgment
    to be given effect, there must be a real and substantial connection between
    the matter decided and the foreign court: see <i>Morguard Investments Ltd.
    v. De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077 and <i>Beals v. Saldanha</i>, [2003]
    3 S.C.R. 416.  Since Daisy was a resident of Kuwait, and in the other circumstances
    of this case, the Kuwait courts were in the best position to assess the estate
    and the competing claims of Juanita and her brothers, all of whom had attorned
    to the jurisdiction of the Kuwait courts.  Accordingly, the motion judge
    was correct in finding a real and substantial connection between Kuwait and
    the competing claims to Daisy’s estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was also correct in concluding that TD was a privy in interest
    to Joseph.  A person may be a privy of another by blood, title or interest:
    see <i>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd. (No. 2),</i> [1967]
    A.C. 853 (H.L.) at 910.  As there is no question of blood or title in this
    case, only privity of interest need be considered.  The concept of privity
    of interest is explained by Megarry V.C. in the seminal case of <i>Gleeson
    v. J. Wippell &amp; Co. Ltd</i>., [1977] 3All E.R. 54 (Ch.) at 59-60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he doctrine of privity for these purposes is
    somewhat narrow, and has to be considered in relation to the fundamental
    principle <i>nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>      </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not say that one must be the <i>alter ego</i> of
    the other:  but it does seem to me that, having due regard to the subject-matter
    of the dispute, there must be a sufficient degree of identification between
    the two to make it just to hold that the decision to which one was party
    should be binding in proceedings to which the other is party.  It is in that
    sense that I would regard the phrase ‘privity of interest’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 35 of his reasons, the motion judge agreed with and adopted the finding
    of the Divisional Court on this issue, at para. 32:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The TD is bound to deliver the funds to the true
    owner and the only persons with a claim to them have become bound by the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kuwait</st1:country-region>
    decision. The TD gave the funds to Joseph and its interest is entirely identical
    to his. It is a
    &quot;privy&quot; of the brothers and so bound even though not a party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I agree with the assessment
    that there was a total identification between the interests of the brothers
    and TD on the ownership issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also see no error in the motion judge’s treatment of the Divisional Court’s
    comments on issue estoppel.  Contrary to TD’s submission, the motion judge’s
    adoption of the Divisional Court’s comments does not signify that the motion
    judge failed to independently assess the application of issue estoppel to
    the facts of this case.  Indeed, in my opinion, it indicates precisely the
    opposite – that the motion judge expressly considered and agreed with the
    Divisional Court’s reasoning on this issue.  This approach is entirely unobjectionable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TD
    further asserts that the dispute in this action is as to the contractual
    rights between the debtor and the alleged creditor and that this dispute
    cannot be determined in the absence of one of the contracting parties, namely
    itself as the debtor.  In making this assertion, TD attempts to cast the
    ownership issue as a banking issue by relying on the decision in <i>Foley
    v. Hill</i> (1848), [1843-60] All E.R. Rep 16 (H.L.) at 19, in an effort
    to distance itself from the discrete issues in the litigation as between
    the siblings.  <i>Foley</i> stands for the proposition that the money on
    deposit is the bank’s money which it can deal with as its own and make a
    profit on if it can, subject only to the requirement that it honour the obligation
    to repay the debt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the question of the use of the money on deposit is not an issue in the present
    proceeding.  The respondent raises no issue relating to TD’s handling of
    the money while it was in the TD account. The dispute over which of two alleged
    creditors holds the contract for repayment has been resolved by the Kuwait
    Courts. The only issue is honouring the outstanding debt by TD as debtor:
    see M.H. Ogilvie, <i>Canadian Banking Law</i>, 2nd ed., <i>supra</i>.  TD
    conceded in its factum on the motion for summary judgment that it would be
    liable to the rightful owner of the funds “regardless of how careful and
    diligent TD was in making the payment to the person not entitled”.  With
    the due diligence defence conceded, no triable issue exists in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    affirming the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel in the present
    circumstances, I would add that this is not a case where the party found
    to be a privy is an innocent third party, without notice or knowledge of
    the proceeding, the outcome of which is said to be binding on it.  While
    it is true that TD was not a party to the Kuwait proceedings, the evidence
    is clear that it took no active steps to seek standing or to participate
    in those proceedings even though it had notice and knowledge of the Kuwait
    proceedings from an early stage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TD
    points to a letter received from Juanita’s counsel in Kuwait dated November
    21, 1999, in which it was stated that “the Experts Department will not interfere
    in properties situated outside of Kuwait, particularly if such properties
    are subject of a lawsuit being considered by a court outside Kuwait.”  TD
    contends that in light of this letter, it would not have been allowed to
    participate in the Kuwait proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this letter did not emanate from the Kuwait courts and did not represent
    a decision of the court.  Moreover, this letter demonstrates that TD was
    made aware of the proceedings and would be able to follow the progress. TD
    appears to have been content to allow the brothers to take full carriage
    of the Kuwait litigation.  Indeed, TD adopted the position of the brothers,
    whom it added as third parties in the Ontario litigation, by supporting the
    brothers’ attempt to stay the Ontario proceedings pending the outcome of
    the Kuwait proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    TD argues that even if issue estoppel would otherwise apply, the motion judge
    erred in principle by failing to consider the appropriateness of exercising
    his discretion not to apply the doctrine:  <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies
    Inc</i>., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at para. 66.  TD contends that the exercise
    of discretion ought to have resulted in issue estoppel not being applied
    in the interests of justice and fairness.  I cannot accede to this submission.  In
    my view, there was no basis upon which such discretion could be exercised
    in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    overriding consideration in the exercise of discretion is fairness, but fairness
    involves a balancing of the interests of both sides.  If TD were to prevail
    in its argument that issue estoppel should not apply, and if a trial were
    directed in Ontario on the ownership issue, the respondent would be required
    to go through another lengthy and costly proceeding, having already done
    so in Kuwait.  This trial would be entirely duplicative of the proceedings – including
    previous multiple appeals – in which she has already participated to obtain
    the judgment that she now holds and to which she seeks to bind TD.  In my
    view, it would be fundamentally unfair to the respondent to fail to recognize
    the judgment of the Kuwait Court in her favour and to compel her to re-litigate
    her case in Ontario.  Putting all the arguments on the merits aside, this
    is not a proper case in which the court ought to exercise its discretion
    in favour of TD so as to permit it to re-litigate the ownership issue.       </p>

    underlying basis for TD’s appeal is its complaint as expressed in its factum
    that: “[t]he result of the motion judge’s judgment is that TD, having paid
    to one member of the Monteiro family the amount of the TD Account, must now
    pay the same amount to a second member of the Monteiro family without TD
    ever having had an opportunity to itself put forward evidence and obtain
    a ruling from a court based on the evidence it saw fit to present.”  This
    submission is only accurate from the flawed perspective on the estate litigation
    that TD would have this court adopt.  It wrongly presumes that TD had an
    underlying interest in the ownership of the assets of the estate, when in
    fact the situation TD finds itself in is the product of it having ignored
    its own internal procedures and thereby having paid the wrong party.  In
    that regard, TD was the author of its own misfortune.  Its internal procedures
    were designed to prevent this exact situation from occurring, but having
    chosen to ignore these procedures, TD now finds itself liable to Juanita
    for the funds in the account.  I see no injustice in this result. </p>

    only manner in which TD could have escaped liability to Juanita was if her
    siblings had been found to be the rightful owners of the funds in the account.  Even
    if TD’s position that it had a right to participate in the estate litigation
    were to be accepted, it had no interest in that litigation distinct from
    that of its privies, Juanita’s siblings. Accordingly, the doctrine of issue
    estoppel was properly applied by the motion judge, with the result that TD
    must now live with the consequences of its own actions. </p>

    reasons of the motion judge reveal no error in law. I would thus dismiss
    the appeal with costs to the respondent.  If the parties are unable to agree
    on quantum of costs, they may file brief written submissions on costs with
    the Registrar of this court within fifteen days.</p>

    Kuwait Court of Appeal held that the 1989 will was a “grant contract” rather
    than a will, but the court nonetheless concluded that the 1989 document effected
    the transfer of the properties held by Daisy to Juanita.</p>
