      McIntosh is an award-winning investigative journalist who was employed
      by the National Post from August 1998 until February 2005.  One of his
      first story ideas at the National Post concerned Prime Minister Jean Chrétien’s
      investment in the Grand-Mère Golf Club located in Mr. Chrétien’s home riding
      of
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    also became interested in Mr. Chrétien’s involvement with a 1997 BDBC loan
    to the Auberge Grand-Mère, a hotel located next to the golf club, and with
    other federal grants in the riding. </span></p>

      initial stories on these subjects were published in January 1999.  According
      to the reviewing judge, they
    “sparked a national debate both in and out of the House of Commons” and prompted
    various people to contact McIntosh.  Some of those people became confidential
    sources of information for him. </span></p>

      a senior investigative reporter, McIntosh had the authority to develop
      his own sources and to make promises of confidentiality to these sources
      as he deemed necessary.  In 1999, McIntosh contacted X because he believed
      X would have the type of information he needed to continue his research
      into these stories.  X was unwilling to provide McIntosh with information
      at that time, even on a confidential basis.</span></p>

      McIntosh provided the undertaking.</span></p>

      then told McIntosh that he or she had contacted him on X’s behalf and that
      X was unwilling to speak to him directly because of a fear of reprisals.  However,
      provided McIntosh gave a blanket, unconditional promise to protect the
      identities of both X and Y, X was willing to provide McIntosh with documents
      and information concerning the Auberge Grand-Mère loan.  McIntosh gave
      the undertaking and subsequently received documents and information from
      Y, including what appeared to be copies of original documents from BDBC
      files.</span></p>

      and urged Beaudoin to approve the loan to Auberge Grand-Mère.  On November
      15, 2000, the National Post published McIntosh’s story concerning these
      events.  When asked by reporters to comment, Mr.&nbsp;Chrétien acknowledged

      April 5, 2001, McIntosh received a sealed plain brown envelope addressed
      to him from an anonymous sender in the daily mail delivery at the Ottawa
      Bureau of the National Post.  The envelope contained a document that appeared
      to be a copy of a BDBC internal loan authorization for a $615,000 mortgage
      to Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime Inc. (Auberge Grand-Mère) in August 1997.  Significantly,
      the document indicated that, at the time it applied for and received the
      loan, Auberge Grand-Mère listed an outstanding debt of $23,040 to “JAC

      his efforts to check the authenticity of the document, McIntosh faxed copies
      to the BDBC, the Prime Minister’s office, and David Scott, counsel to the
      Prime Minister.  All three claimed that the document was a forgery.  The
      BDBC sent two letters to the National Post on April 6, 2001.  The first
      said that the document appeared to be a forgery, as the BDBC’s records
      showed no indication of a debt to JAC Consultants.  In the second letter,
      the BDBC claimed that the National Post was in possession of confidential
      bank documents, the contents of which should not be disclosed. </span></p>

    in the week after McIntosh received the document, X contacted him and requested
    a meeting.  At their meeting, X asked for an undertaking of confidentiality,
    which McIntosh gave.  X then admitted sending the document to McIntosh and
    asked that the envelope be destroyed.  X explained that he or she was afraid
    that the authorities might try to use it to identify him or her through fingerprint
    or DNA analysis, and expressed concern that the envelope might link him or
    her to a document now alleged to be a forgery.  McIntosh refused to destroy
    the envelope but told X that he had taken steps to secure both it and the
    document.  McIntosh also told X that his undertaking of confidentiality would
    remain binding so long as he believed that X had not sent him the document

      he or she had received the document in the mail anonymously and had passed
      it on to McIntosh in the belief that it was genuine and involved a matter
      of considerable public interest.  McIntosh claims that, on one other occasion,
      he was able to confirm the authenticity of documents that X had received

      met with McIntosh, two senior editors of the National Post, and counsel

      received the document in a plain brown envelope with no return address

      of the search warrant application, Gallant noted that counsel for the National
      Post had “indicated a desire to have notice of, and to appear, on the consideration
      of this application.”  However, Gallant also said that, in his view, notice
      was unnecessary:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>In consultation
    with Crown counsel, and with reference to the judgment of the Ontario Court
    of Appeal in <i>R. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i> … I do not believe

    the request of the National Post for notice to the attention of this Court

      basis for National Post’s request for notice of the search warrant application
      is not apparent from the body of the information to obtain.  However, statements
      in two letters from counsel for the National Post</span>, attached as exhibits
      to the information to obtain, show that the National Post’s concern was
      twofold: the purpose of the search warrant was to assist in identifying
      a confidential source, and this would amount to a violation of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>

    a letter to Crown counsel dated December 19, 2001, counsel for the National
    Post stated: “The search for this plain brown envelope is justified, if at
    all, by the belief that it could identify a confidential source … we are
    gravely concerned about the seriousness of the constitutional violation that
    is about to occur”. </p>

    a subsequent letter to Crown counsel dated April 9, 2002, counsel for the
    National Post repeated this concern:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>In December
    2001 and early January 2002 I informed you, on behalf of The National Post,
    that they declined the invitation to assist in identifying and handing over
    the envelope.  <i>Obviously, the concern of The National Post rests upon
    the fact that such assistance will inevitably cause them to be an essential
    piece in the chain of evidence identifying a confidential source.</i> [Emphasis

    t<span lang=EN-US>he search warrant and assistance order were issued without
    notice, they included relatively standard terms for search warrants of media
    premises.  For example, they required the police to interfere as little as
    possible with the operations of the </span>National Post <span lang=EN-US>and
    gave the </span>National Post <span lang=EN-US>the right to request that
    items seized be sealed pending an application to determine the validity of
    the search warrant and assistance order.  In addition, while the search warrant
    and assistance order were to be served on July 5, 2002, no search was to

    our view, the reviewing judge erred in holding that the issuing judge committed
    a jurisdictional error by issuing the search warrant and assistance order
    without notice.  The search warrant and assistance order fully recognized
    the respondents’ rights because they ensured that, if requested by the respondents,
    the items sought by the police would not be disclosed until the validity
    of the search warrant and assistance order was determined on judicial review.  Neither
    the decision of this court in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>,

      court, rejected the argument that notice to the media should be added to
      this list of factors.  Moreover, Moldaver J.A. determined that on the facts
      of <i>R. v.</i> <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>,<i> </i>the judge who
      issued the search warrant against media premises did not lose jurisdiction
      by proceeding without notice.  Although he acknowledged a theoretical possibility
      that failure to give notice could constitute jurisdictional error in some
      instances, Moldaver J.A. said he considered that possibility to be “remote

    respondents argue that this case is distinguishable from <i>R. v.</i> <i>Canadian
    Broadcasting Corp.</i> because, in finding that notice to the media was unnecessary,
    Moldaver J.A. relied on two key factors not present in this case: (i) the
    material sought was similar to material that had already been published;
    and (ii) there was no suggestion that the material sought “emanates from
    a confidential source or is otherwise the product of media research or investigation.” </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents argue that, in this case, their input on the search warrant application
    was essential because the search warrant and assistance order were aimed
    at identifying a confidential source.  According to the respondents, by failing
    to direct that notice be given to them, the issuing judge deprived himself
    of important information concerning journalist-confidential source privilege
    and s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> that he was required to consider and thereby
    committed jurisdictional error.</p>

    disagree.  In <i>R. v.</i> <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>, Moldaver J.A.
    said the two factors identified by the respondents made it especially clear
    that the issuing judge was not required to give notice.  However, he did
    not say that failure to give notice where those factors were not present
    would give rise to jurisdictional error. </p>

    our view, although Moldaver J.A. recognized that cases concerning documents
    or information from confidential sources could raise different considerations
    from the specific fact situation before him, he nevertheless concluded that
    the prospect of an issuing judge losing jurisdiction by proceeding without
    notice was extremely remote and that the current model of <i>ex parte</i> authorization
    followed by judicial review was adequate to protect the media. </p>

    in this case, the terms of the search warrant and assistance order not only
    permitted the respondents to require that the items sought be sealed pending
    a court order, they also provided the respondents with sufficient time to
    obtain an order staying execution of the search warrant and assistance order
    pending further order.  In our view, nothing about this case justifies the
    conclusion that it falls within the extremely limited category of cases Moldaver

    487(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for privileged material or by issuing
    a warrant for search and seizure in a manner that interferes inappropriately
    with the freedom of the press.  In relation to privileged material, this
    is because s. 487(1)(b) authorizes only seizure of material that is admissible
    as evidence; if a judge authorizes seizure of privileged material, the judge
    exceeds his or her jurisdiction.  However, Lamer J. did not say that proceeding
    without notice, in itself, amounts to jurisdictional error.  Moreover, he
    endorsed a procedure similar to the one used in this case in which a seized
    document was to be sealed and returned to the issuing justice to determine
    what, if any, portions were privileged.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>teaux </i>because <i>Desc</i><i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>teaux </i>dealt with solicitor-client privilege.
    As solicitor-client privilege is a class privilege, communications subject
    to the privilege are presumptively inadmissible. This raises an issue concerning
    an issuing justice’s jurisdiction to order seizure under s. 487(1)(b) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> from the outset.  In contrast, journalist-confidential
    source privilege is not a class privilege, but rather must be established
    on a case-by-case by basis. Communications potentially subject to the privilege
    are presumptively admissible and become inadmissible only after the privilege
    is recognized.  Accordingly, the same level of concern about the issuing
    justice acting without jurisdiction before the privilege issue is determined
    does not arise. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, although the issuing judge in this case certainly had the discretion
    to inquire further into the claim of journalist-confidential source privilege,
    he did not lose jurisdiction by issuing the search warrant and assistance
    order without notice, but on terms that would protect the items sought from
    external review until the privilege claim was determined. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    add one final point.  Even assuming the respondents had a valid claim for
    journalist-confidential source privilege to protect the identity of X, at
    best, they were entitled to an order restricting the use that could be made
    of material and information on the items sought.  They were not entitled

style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    say this because shortly after receiving the document, McIntosh sent copies
    to several people in an effort to authenticate it.  His conduct demonstrates
    that, at its core, the respondents’ privilege claim relates to material and
    information on the document and envelope that might reveal the identity of
    the sender.  Their claim does not relate to the communicative aspects of
    the document and envelope. </p>

    our view, since the original document and envelope could be required to prove
    an offence, the most the respondents could fairly ask for were terms addressing
    whether these items should be subjected to forensic testing or sealed.  That
    request could properly be addressed following the execution of the search
    warrant and assistance order.  This additional point reinforces our conclusion
    that the issuing judge did not lose jurisdiction by proceeding without notice.  </p>

    the amplified record showed that only McIntosh knew where the items sought
    were stored, there was no basis for finding that the editor-in-chief could
    provide the required assistance.  Second, they say that the assistance order
    violates their rights under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> because it conscripts
    the editor-in-chief into becoming an agent of the police and compels him
    to breach his ethical obligations.  Third, they say that the assistance order
    is too vague because it does not define exactly what steps the editor-in-chief
    is required to take, or what he is to do if McIntosh does not comply with
    a request to produce the items sought.</p>

    reject these submissions. The amplified record confirms that McIntosh is
    the only person who knows the location of the document and envelope.  However,
    in the time leading up to the issuance of the search warrant and assistance
    order, both McIntosh and the National Post made statements suggesting that
    these items were subject to the control of the National Post. </p>

    example, when asked by Gallant at their June 7, 2001 meeting if he kept the
    envelope, McIntosh responded that he had “not destroyed any documents the
    [news]paper received.”  In a letter to Gallant dated December 13, 2001, counsel
    for the National Post stated, “the newspaper does not intend to deliver up
    to you the ‘plain brown envelope with no return address’ as referred to by
    Andrew McIntosh … at the Toronto meeting.”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    in a letter dated April 30, 2002 to Crown counsel advising Gallant, counsel
    for the National Post confirmed that during the course of their dealings
    relating to the proposed search warrant,
    “all officials at the National Post, including Mr. McIntosh, undertook to
    ensure that no steps would be taken to alter or destroy the documents in
    light of the allegation that the documents themselves were fraudulent.” </p>

    these statements, the ongoing discussions between the National Post, Gallant,
    and Crown counsel leading up to the issuance of the search warrant and assistance
    order, and the fact that during this period neither the National Post nor
    McIntosh informed Gallant that McIntosh alone knew the location of the document
    and envelope, we see nothing improper about directing the assistance order
    to the editor-in-chief of the National Post.  If the respondents desire,
    the assistance order can be amended so that it is directed to both the editor-in-chief
    and McIntosh.  </p>

    of the document have been widely distributed and its contents extensively
    reported in the media.  Instead, the respondents’ concern is that forensic

    Crown responded that any confidentiality in the relationship between McIntosh
    and X – either under the <i>Charter</i> or at common law – must yield to
    the superior interest of getting at the truth, of investigating and prosecuting
    a serious crime.  It contended that the document and envelope were the <i>actus</i>

    reviewing judge resolved this clash of competing interests in favour of the
    respondents on both branches of their argument.  First, she concluded that
    the search warrant and assistance order violated s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In
    her view, “the eroding of the ability of the press to perform its role in
    society cannot be outweighed by the Crown’s investigation.”  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the reviewing judge concluded that because “the documents may reveal the
    identity of a confidential source, they are privileged.”  In so concluding,
    she applied the four criteria set out by Professor Wigmore and accepted by
    Canadian courts for determining the existence of a privileged communication
    or relationship on a case-by-case basis.  On the fourth and critical Wigmore
    criterion, the reviewing judge found that the benefits of protecting the
    identity of McIntosh’s source “outweigh the benefits of disclosure in the
    context of this investigation”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, the Crown focused on the reviewing judge’s finding of privilege.  The
    respondents, however, maintained that the Crown’s appeal should be dismissed
    on the basis either of the reviewing judge’s finding of privilege or her
    finding of a <i>Charter</i> violation.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, whether considered under the law of privilege or under s. 2(b)
    of the <i>Charter</i>, the analysis, with one caveat, is in substance the
    same.  Both analyses require the court to balance the privacy interest of
    the press and the competing law enforcement interest of the state.  The caveat – which
    the reviewing judge properly recognized – is that the application of the
    Wigmore criteria must itself take account of the values underlying ss. 2(b)
    and 8 of the <i>Charter</i>: see for example <i>A.(M.) v. Ryan</i>, [1997]
    1 S.C.R. 157 at para. 30.</p>

    of course, accept as did the reviewing judge that the gathering and dissemination
    of news and information without undue state interference is an integral component
    of the respondents’ constitutional right of freedom of the press under s.
    2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>: see <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Lessard</i> (1991),
    67 C.C.C. (3d) 517 at 522, 533.  However, this does not mean that press organizations
    or journalists are immune from valid searches under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  And
    s. 2(b) does not guarantee that journalists have an automatic right to protect
    the confidentiality of their sources.  The court must ensure that the privacy
    interests of the press are limited as little as possible.  But the court
    must also balance against the privacy interest of the press the state or
    other societal interests in getting at the truth. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Equally,
    under the common law of privilege as reflected in the Wigmore criteria, the
    court must balance the privacy interest of the claimant against the state
    or societal interest in getting at the truth and correctly disposing of the
    litigation.  Because both the s. 2(b) analysis and the Wigmore analysis require
    this same balancing, we consider it appropriate to address the competing
    arguments of the parties within the existing common law framework provided
    by the Wigmore criteria.  Resort to <i>Charter</i> remedies is unnecessary.  Understandably,
    the Wigmore criteria were not only the focus of the Crown’s submissions,
    they were also central to the respondents’ submissions.</p>

    this court and the Supreme Court of Canada have said that a “privilege” is
    an exception to the fundamental proposition that everyone has a general duty
    to give evidence relevant to a matter before the courts.  A privilege is
    recognized only where required by an overriding societal interest: see <i>Reference
    re Legislative Privilege</i> (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 226 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Ryan</i> at para. 19.  That is so because a privilege impedes the
    pursuit of truth.  It means that the court must attempt to do justice in
    a case without potentially relevant and admissible evidence.  Therefore,
    as a starting point, press organizations and journalists, like everyone else,
  owe a duty to give relevant evidence in a case before the courts.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless,
    Canadian courts have recognized two categories of common law privilege: class
    privilege and case-by-case privilege: see <i>R. v. Gruenke</i> (1991), 67
    C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 303 (S.C.C.).  A class privilege – sometimes aptly called
    a blanket privilege – carries with it a presumption of inadmissibility.  Two
    well-known and well-established class privileges are solicitor-client and
    police-informer.  Under the former, communications between lawyers and their
    clients are presumptively privileged; under the latter the identity of a
    police informant is also presumptively privileged.  A party seeking disclosure
    or urging admissibility of solicitor-client communications or of the identity
    of a police informant must show why the privilege should not attach.  </p>

    Court said that the confidentiality of the relationship between a journalist
    and the journalist’s source may be protected on a case-by-case basis.  Whether
    the privilege will be recognized in a given case must be determined by applying
    the four Wigmore criteria.  These criteria are: </p>

    reviewing judge applied Wigmore’s criteria to the amplified record in the
    light of these <i>Charter</i> values, and found that the respondents had
    established each of the four criteria.  The Crown submits that the reviewing
    judge erred in each of her findings.  However, it devoted most of its argument
    to the third and especially the crucial fourth criterion.  The Crown also
    submits that we should review her ultimate finding of privilege on a standard
    of correctness.   </p>

    overall conclusion, which we will elaborate on, is as follows.  The reviewing
    judge’s findings on the first two Wigmore criteria are findings of fact,
    which are reasonably supported by the amplified record.  We therefore defer
    to these findings.  See <i>H. L</i>. <i>v.

    on the third Wigmore criterion is likely a finding of mixed fact and law.  Although
    we have some doubts about this finding, we need not interfere with it.  There
    is no need to do so because in our opinion at bottom this appeal turns on
    the weighing of the competing press and state interests called for by the
    fourth criterion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    weighing calls for a measure of judicial discretion.  Thus the reviewing
    judge’s finding, which favoured confidentiality over disclosure, is entitled
    to deference from an appellate court.  Even so, we consider her finding unreasonable.  We
    consider it unreasonable because it rests on important inferences, which
    are not supported by the record, and on an inadequate regard for the important
    law enforcement interest at stake in this case.  We therefore set aside the
    reviewing judge’s determination that the document and envelope are privileged
    and restore the issuing judge’s order that the editor-in-chief of the National
    Post produce them to the Crown.</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-style:normal'>(iii)     The first Wigmore criterion: the communications
      must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reviewing judge found that this first criterion was met.  The Crown disputes
    this finding for two reasons: first, it says that although X sent the document
    to McIntosh anonymously, X did so before McIntosh had given X any promise
    of confidentiality; and second, it says that the document and envelope are
    not
    “communications” but pieces of real evidence that existed independently of
    the relationship between McIntosh and X.  We do not accept either argument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reviewing judge found that McIntosh had promised X confidentiality before
    he received the document.  That finding is grounded in the evidence.  McIntosh
    received the document and envelope in early April 2001.  However, the preceding
    fall – the fall of 2000 – McIntosh had been contacted by Y on X’s behalf
    and at that time, in the reviewing judge’s words:
    “Mr. McIntosh gave a blanket, unconditional promise of confidentiality to
    protect the identity of both X and Y.”  Therefore, contrary to the Crown’s
    argument, X sent the document to McIntosh after the promise of confidentiality
    had been given.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    one sense, as the Crown argues, the document and envelope are pieces of real
    evidence and not communications.  However, the Crown’s argument misunderstands
    the nature of the privilege asserted by the respondents.  The journalist-confidential
    source privilege protects the identity of the source and any information
    that might identify the source.  And one of the reasons the Crown wants disclosure
    of the document and envelope is precisely because they may reveal the identity
    of X or the forger.  Accordingly, if the identity of the source is to be
    protected so too should any real evidence that may reveal the source’s identity.  Thus,
    as the respondents contend, and as the reviewing judge found: “To disclose
    the document, would be to negate the confidence.”  We agree.  We therefore
    uphold the reviewing judge’s finding on the first Wigmore criterion.</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-style:normal'>(iv)      The second Wigmore criterion: the element
      of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance
      of the relationship between the parties</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reviewing judge also found that the second criterion – that the element of
    confidentiality be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of
    the relationship between the parties – was met.  This criterion should be
    considered both in a narrow and a broad context.  Narrowly, the focus is
    on the journalist and the confidential source, here McIntosh and X.  More
    broadly, the focus is on the relationship between journalists and their sources. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The
    reviewing judge not only found that confidentiality was essential to the
    maintenance of the relationship between McIntosh and X, she also concluded
    more broadly that without confidential sources the media could not function
    effectively.  She put it this way at para. 48 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>Inherent in
    the concept of confidentiality is the ability of the media to protect the
    identity of the source.  The evidence establishes that sources may
    “dry-up” if their identities were revealed.  Without confidential sources,
    many important stories of considerable public interest would not have been
    published.  Confidential sources are essential to the effective functioning
    of the media in a free and democratic society. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown contends that the reviewing judge had no basis to conclude the media
    require confidential sources to carry out its constitutionally protected
    activities.  We disagree.  Although the reviewing judge’s strong conclusion
    may be somewhat overstated, the Crown’s contention is refuted by the amplified
    record, case law, and common sense.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the record.  The respondents filed the affidavits of fifteen respected journalists.  The
    reviewing judge fairly summarized their evidence in the following sentence:
    “The evidence demonstrates that the use of confidential sources is essential
    to the uncovering and reporting of matters of public interest.”  The Crown
    filed no contrary evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    case law.  In <i>Lessard</i> at pp. 522 and 539 both La Forest J. in his
    concurring reasons, and McLachlin J. in her dissent, wrote that in some circumstances
    the press’ ability to gather information and report on matters of public
    interest may be restricted if journalists cannot protect the confidentiality
    of their sources.  Some sources may fear speaking to a journalist if their
    identity will be disclosed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    common sense.  Here we can do no better than quote what La Forest J. said
    in <i>Lessard</i> at p. 522: “That someone might be deterred from providing
    information to a journalist because his or her identity could be revealed
    seems to me to be self-evident.”  It seems self-evident to us as well.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    we accept the reviewing judge’s finding that the respondents established
    the second Wigmore criterion.  We do think, however, that her strong conclusion
    that media sources may “dry-up” unless the journalist-confidential source
    relationship is protected needs to be qualified to some degree. Here we make
    two points. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    although routinely ordering journalists to disclose their confidential sources
    may be likely to deter these sources from coming forward and may cause them
    to “dry-up”, nonetheless, journalist-confidential source privilege is not
    a blanket privilege. Journalists can never guarantee confidentiality.  There
    will be some cases – and this is one of them – where the privilege cannot
    be recognized.  Refusing to recognize the privilege in appropriate cases
    will not, in our view, cause media sources to “dry-up”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    many journalists have not needed to offer confidentiality to their sources
    to encourage them to come forward.  Indeed, as the intervenors fairly pointed
    out, many journalists prefer to stay on the record, and will rely only on
    sources whom they can identify.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless,
    the Crown cannot deny the proposition that some sources will not come forward
    without a promise of confidentiality.  And if they do not come forward some
    public interest stories will not be investigated and reported on.  At least
    to that extent, the element of confidentiality is essential to the full and
    satisfactory maintenance of the journalist-confidential source relationship.</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-style:normal'>(v)       The third Wigmore criterion: the relationship
      must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be “sedulously
      fostered” </span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Ryan</i> at
    para. 20, McLachlin J. interpreted this criterion to mean that the relationship
    must be one that should be “sedulously fostered” for the public good.  “Sedulous” means
    diligent, painstaking, or persevering: see <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>,
    2d ed., <i>s.v.</i> “sedulous”.  Thus, the third Wigmore criterion requires
    that the relationship in question be diligently fostered for the public good.  The
    reviewing judge found at para. 61 that the journalist-confidential source
    relationship should be fostered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>The importance
    of the journalist-informant relationship is established by the evidence.  If
    the journalist-informant relationship is undermined, society as a whole is
    affected.  It is through confidential sources that matters of great public
    importance are made known.  As corporate and public power increase, the ability
    of the average citizen to affect his or her world depends upon the information
    disseminated by the press.  To deprive the media of an important tool in
    the gathering of news would affect society as a whole.  The relationship
    is one that should be fostered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that in so finding the reviewing judge made two errors.  First,
    it contends that in today’s society we have no principled basis to distinguish
    between those journalists who are entitled to confidential source relationships
    and those who are not.  Today, many persons, especially by using the internet,
    may be called “journalists” or “the press” because they disseminate information
    to the public, yet may not merit the journalist-confidential source privilege.  Second,
    the Crown contends that we should not sedulously foster a relationship that
    the respondents are using to shield a possible wrongdoer from investigation
    and prosecution for a serious criminal offence.  Promoting this relationship
    between McIntosh and X does not advance the public good; indeed the Crown
    says that doing so is antithetical to the core values underlying s. 2(b)
    of the <i>Charter</i> – using the constitutional guarantee of freedom of
    the press not to get at the truth, but to subvert it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject the Crown’s first contention.  The case-by-case approach to privilege
    does not require us to establish the boundaries of legitimate journalism.  The
    National Post is a recognized national news organization and McIntosh is
    a respected journalist.  It can hardly be disputed that they fall within
    the class of persons who may be entitled to the benefit of journalist-confidential
    source privilege.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s second contention raises a difficult question, but one that we do
    not need to resolve to decide this appeal.  Essentially, the question under
    the third Wigmore criterion is whether the relationship should be characterized
    broadly as a journalist-confidential source relationship, or more narrowly
    as a journalist-criminal wrongdoer relationship.  The reviewing judge used
    the broad approach; the Crown advocates the more narrow one.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    viewed at a broad level, we agree with the reviewing judge that the relationship
    between a journalist and a confidential source should be diligently fostered
    for the public good.  As we have said, some matters of public interest could
    not be thoroughly investigated or investigated at all without confidential
    sources of information.  Moreover, the reviewing judge’s approach finds support
    in two Supreme Court of Canada decisions.  In <i>Slavutych v. Baker</i>,
    [1976] 1 S.C.R. 254 at 261, the court characterized the relationship as one
    between “colleagues” at a university; in <i>Ryan</i> at para. 25, McLachlin&nbsp;J.
    characterized the relationship as one between psychiatrists and patients
    seeking treatment from harm resulting from sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the other hand, some comments of this court in <i>Reference</i> <i>re Legislative
    Privilege</i> suggest that in an appropriate case we should look at the third
    Wigmore criterion through a narrower lens.  For example at p. 236, Lacourcière
    J.A. did not characterize the relationship broadly as one between a member
    of the Assembly and an informant; instead he characterized it more narrowly
    as one between a member of the Assembly and an informant with knowledge of
    criminal wrongdoing:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>In brief, there
    is no reason under the third condition propounded by Wigmore for the recognition
    of a privilege, to say that the relation between members of the Assembly
    and informants “ought to be sedulously fostered”.  On the contrary, we believe
    the opinion of the community would be that informers with relevant information
    of criminal wrongdoings should be encouraged to go to the police, who are
    charged with the responsibility of investigating suspected crimes and breaches
    of statute law.  The informer is then, regardless of his motive, acting in
    the public interest, to protect society from wrongdoers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    United States Supreme Court took a similar approach in its important decision, <i>Branzburg
    v. Hayes</i>, 408 U.S. 665 (1972).  There, the court concluded that requiring
    journalists to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries did
    not abridge their freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment.  White
    J., writing for the court, in words that might well apply to the third Wigmore
    criterion, said at p. 696: “More important, it is obvious that agreements
    to conceal information relevant to commission of crime have very little to
    recommend them from the standpoint of public policy”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the purpose of this appeal, we need not resolve this debate nor interfere
    with the reviewing judge’s finding.  Even if we accept her finding that the
    third Wigmore criterion has been met because the relationship between journalists
    and their sources, broadly speaking, should be diligently fostered for the
    public good, the narrower or more specific focus urged on us by the Crown
    is still very relevant to the crucial balancing under the fourth Wigmore
    criterion.  We now turn to that balancing.</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-style:normal'>(vi)      The fourth Wigmore criterion: the injury
      to the relationship from the disclosure of the communications must be greater
      than the benefit gained from the correct disposal of the litigation</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reviewing judge found that the benefit from protecting the identity of McIntosh’s
    source outweighed the societal interest in getting at the truth and correctly
    disposing of the litigation.  She therefore concluded that because the document
    and envelope may reveal the identity of X they were privileged.  She set
    out the grounds for her finding and conclusion at paras. 78 to 80 of her
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>[78]     The
    Wigmore criteria, applied to this case, demonstrate an overwhelming interest
    in protecting the identity of Mr. McIntosh’s source.  But more is required.  It
    must also be demonstrated that the benefit that inures from privilege outweighs
    the interest in the correct disposal of the litigation.  As Chief Justice
    McLachlin stated, this exercise is “essentially one of common sense and good
    judgment.”
    [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'> [79]    The
    balancing of these competing interests leads me to confirm the privilege.  Here,
    the document is required as part of an investigation, not the defence of
    an accused.  There is evidence that the document was probably extensively
    handled.  There is only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints
    were those of the alleged forgerer.  Disclosure of the document will minimally,
    if at all, advance the investigation while at the same time damage freedom
    of expression.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>[80]     There
    are unique factors here, including, the confidential relationship between
    X and Mr. McIntosh: the fact that he was promised confidentiality; the politically
    charged nature of the information obtained; the importance of informing Canadians
    with respect to the most powerful political figure in the country; and the
    vast body of evidence and jurisprudence produced which show the importance
    of confidentiality in the news gathering role of the press.  All these factors
    outweigh the benefits of disclosure in the context of this investigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that these paragraphs reveal two significant errors.  First,
    the Crown submits that the reviewing judge erred in inferring in para. 79
    that “[t]here is only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints
    were those of the alleged forgerer” and that “[d]isclosure of the document
    will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation”.  Second, the Crown
    submits that she erred in para. 80 by almost entirely disregarding the important
    law enforcement interest at stake in this case.  Thus she unreasonably skewed
    the careful balancing required by the fourth Wigmore criterion.  We agree
    with the Crown’s submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    begin with the two related inferences drawn by the reviewing judge: the “remote
    and speculative possibility” inference and the “minimally, if at all”
    inference.  These inferences caused her to seriously diminish the importance
    of the law enforcement interest in the document and the envelope. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see four problems with these inferences.  First, in inferring that the document
    would be of little value in identifying the forger, the reviewing judge referred
    only to the unlikely possibility of fingerprints on the document.  The police,
    however, were not just interested in fingerprints.  The evidence showed that
    they were also interested in the saliva on the envelope, which through DNA
    testing may well identify the forger or the person who sent the forged document.  The
    reviewing judge failed to take account of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the reviewing judge failed to take account of McIntosh’s evidence, which
    she had referred to earlier in her reasons, that X asked him to destroy the
    document and the envelope because X was concerned that forensic testing would
    identify him or her.  At the very least, X’s request shows that X believed
    disclosure of the document and envelope would advance the investigation.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    in drawing these inferences, the reviewing judge implicitly relied on McIntosh’s
    beliefs about the genuineness of the document and the reliability of X.  McIntosh
    believes that the document is genuine, but if it is not, he believes that
    X did not know it was a forgery.  Yet, on the amplified record, the reviewing
    judge sustained the issuing judge’s conclusion that there are reasonable
    and probable grounds to believe the document is a forgery.  Having upheld
    this conclusion, the reviewing judge should not have deferred to McIntosh’s
    beliefs.  Like her, we accept the sincerity of his beliefs.  But the police,
    not McIntosh and not the court, should determine whether the document and
    envelope will provide evidence to identify either the forger or the person
    who uttered the forged document. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    last, the inferences drawn by the reviewing judge under the fourth Wigmore
    criterion are inconsistent with her finding under the first Wigmore criterion,
    which we quoted earlier: “To disclose the document, would be to negate the
    confidence.”  If it is a remote and speculative possibility that forensic
    testing will reveal the identity of the person who sent the document, then
    disclosing the document and envelope will not likely negate any confidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus
    we conclude that the two inferences drawn by the reviewing judge – there
    is only a remote and speculative possibility that disclosure of the document
    and envelope will identify the forger; and disclosure of the document and
    envelope will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation – are unsupportable.
    We approach the balancing on that basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    will now address the Crown’s second argument – that the reviewing judge disregarded
    the importance of the law enforcement interest in this case.  In setting
    out the press interest in confidentiality at para. 80 of her reasons, the
    reviewing judge properly took account both of considerations specific to
    the case before her and broader societal considerations.  She also recognized
    at para. 78 of her reasons the important point McLachlin J. made in <i>Ryan</i> at
    para. 31: to establish a case-by-case privilege the respondents have to make
    out more than a compelling case for confidentiality; they also have to show
    that the benefit from privilege, no matter how great, outweighs the law enforcement
    interest in disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    in weighing the competing interests, as well as addressing the considerations
    favouring confidentiality, the court must also address the considerations –
    both specific to the case and societal – favouring disclosure.  Unfortunately,
    the reviewing judge did not do so.  We therefore will set them out here.  As
    will become evident, the considerations favouring disclosure of the document
    and the envelope sharply outweigh those favouring confidentiality.  Indeed,
    as we view the case, the law enforcement interest in disclosure is overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    document and the envelope are not merely pieces of evidence tending to show
    that a crime has been committed.  They are the very <i>actus</i>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>reus</i> of the alleged crime.  For the purpose of demonstrating that
    a crime was committed – the crime of uttering a forged document to the National
    Post – evidence is not available from another source.  Gallant so testified
    in the information to obtain, and the respondents did not suggest otherwise.  Moreover,
    nothing in the amplified record points to any other avenue of investigation
    of this discrete offence.  Therefore, without the document and the envelope
    and the ability to conduct forensic testing of them there can be no further
    investigation, no ability to get at the truth.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not diminish the press’ important role in uncovering and reporting an
    alleged wrongdoing.  But in our society it is the police who are charged
    with the crucial role of investigating and prosecuting crime.  And, to paraphrase
    what White J. said in <i>Branzburg v. Hayes</i> at p. 692, it is not necessarily
    better to write about crime than to do something about it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    this is no ordinary crime.  This is an especially grave and heinous crime.  Assuming
    the document was forged, either the forger or some other person sent it to
    the National Post to create controversy and undermine the authority of a
    sitting Prime Minister of Canada.  The National Post itself admitted that
    if the document was forged, it would be evidence of a criminal conspiracy
    to force a duly elected Prime Minister from office.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    while the law enforcement interest is overwhelming, the press’ legitimate
    interest in confidentiality is attenuated.  Although, in pursuit of their
    constitutional right to gather and disseminate the news, journalists are
    entitled to protect their sources, that entitlement loses much of its force
    when journalists use it to protect the identity of a potential criminal or
    to conceal possible evidence of a crime.  The press, like any one else, should
    have “an interest in seeing that crimes are investigated and prosecuted”:
    see <i>Lessard</i> at 535.  Society expects as much.  Instead of furthering
    that interest, however, the respondents are shielding a potential wrongdoer
    from prosecution for a serious crime by refusing to deliver to the authorities
    the items representing the <i>actus</i>
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>reus</i> of the offence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McIntosh
    himself recognized that there must be at least some limits on the press’
    entitlement to protect the confidentiality of its sources.  That is why he
    told X that his promise of confidentiality would remain binding only so long
    as he believed that he was not being misled.  However, once the court concluded
    that there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the document was
    a forgery, McIntosh could not arrogate to himself the right to decide whether
    X was a wrongdoer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    we conclude that the respondents’ claim of privilege over the document and
    envelope fails on the fourth Wigmore criterion.  The Crown urged us to go
    farther and say that the law enforcement interest in disclosure will always
    trump the media’s claim to a journalist-confidential source privilege.  We
    decline to do so because the Crown’s position is antithetical to the recognition
    of a case-by-case privilege.  </p>

    leave to another day and another case whether on different facts a privilege
    may be recognized.  In the case before us, we set aside the reviewing judge’s

    produced to the Crown.</p>

    Crown adduced evidence on the hearing before the reviewing judge that strengthens
    the inference that the document is a forgery.  For example, in an affidavit
    filed before the reviewing judge, Gallant gave evidence supporting the authenticity
    of the stamp on the first page of the BDBC copy of the document.  As it may
    not be appropriate to take account of such evidence when assessing whether
    the issuing judge could have issued the warrant, we have not done so.</p>
