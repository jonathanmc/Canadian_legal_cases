  <h4>SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s case was based on a statement made to the police by Johan Cerdas,
    the victim of the first robbery, a videotaped statement made by Granston
    to the police after his arrest, the evidence of Todor Stankov, the victim
    of the second robbery, and evidence of certain items found in the possession
    of the appellants and Granston at the time of their arrest very shortly after
    the second robbery.  The statements made by Mr. Cerdas and Granston were
    hearsay and <i>prima facie</i> inadmissible.  The Crown successfully moved
    for their admission under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.  The
    admissibility of those statements is the focus of the conviction appeals.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the Crown’s case, the first robbery occurred at about 10:00 p.m. on a public
    bus travelling in the west end of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Mr. Cerdas, who was eighteen, was riding on the bus when a gang
    of five or six young men surrounded him.  One of the gang demanded Mr. Cerdas’ earpiece.  When
    Mr. Cerdas refused, this person produced a sawed off shotgun, pointed it
    at Mr. Cerdas’ chest and threatened him.  A gang attack followed.  Mr. Cerdas
    was pushed, punched and kicked.  His glasses were broken.  During the attack,
    the assailants stole Mr. Cerdas’ ring, earpiece, watch, and cell phone.  When
    the bus stopped, the gang tried to pull Mr. Cerdas off the bus, presumably
    to continue their attack, but he managed to stay on the bus and it drove
    away.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    gang then made their way to the subway.  They rode to the Victoria Park station.  On
    the ride, they decided to rob a pizza delivery man.  One of the gang phoned
    and ordered pizzas delivered to a specific apartment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Stankov had the misfortune to be delivering pizzas that night.  He responded
    to the order.  As Mr. Stankov walked toward the apartment building with three
    pizzas, two masked gunmen approached him.  One had a sawed-off shotgun, and
    the other had a handgun.  At gunpoint, they forced Mr. Stankov to the door
    of a stairwell in the apartment building.  A third man opened the door, and
    Mr. Stankov was pushed inside the stairwell.  Two other men were waiting
    for him.  The gang beat and kicked Mr. Stankov and took his money.  Mr. Stankov
    readily gave up the money (about $200) but resisted giving his assailants
    his wallet because it contained his immigration papers.  A security guard
    heard Mr. Stankov calling for help and came to his assistance.  The guard
    called 911.  The robbers fled toward the subway.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Within
    moments of Mr. Stankov’s robbery, surveillance cameras videotaped a group
    of young men, including A.R. and S.S, entering the subway.  S.S. was carrying
    three pizza boxes from the store that employed Mr. Stankov.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    police stopped the subway and arrested the appellants on the subway platform.  When
    A.R. was arrested, he was in possession of a pizza box from Mr. Stankov’s
    employer, a sawed off shotgun, an imitation firearm, and Mr. Cerdas’ cell
    phone.  The imitation handgun was not operable.  A piece of the same gun
    was found at the scene of the Stankov robbery.  The gun had blood on the
    grip, which was consistent with Mr. Stankov’s blood type.  Blood found on
    A.R.’s shoes and pants was also consistent with Mr. Stankov’s blood type.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    S.S. was arrested, about $111 in coins and bills was found stuffed into his
    coat pocket.  The amount and denomination of the bills were consistent with
    having come from the robbery of Mr. Stankov.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Granston
    was also seen on video entering the subway with the appellants.  He escaped
    from the subway, but was apprehended by the police a short time later in
    a nearby ravine.  Mr. Cerdas’ ring was found on the ground beside Granston.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants testified, as did their co-accused, A.M.  They all gave basically
    the same version of events.  According to this version, the appellants were
    with a group of friends on the night of the robberies.  The group played
    basketball together.  A.R. and S.S. were good friends.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    appellants acknowledged being present when the robberies occurred but denied
    any involvement in either robbery.  They testified that the first robbery
    must have occurred after a brief altercation on the bus involving Mr. Cerdas
    and John, and seconds after the two appellants and A.M. got off the bus but
    before John and Granston had left the bus.  The appellants testified that
    while they were aware of an altercation between Mr. Cerdas and John, they
    were unaware of any robbery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants also testified that the robbery of the pizza delivery man, a short
    time after the robbery on the bus, came as a complete surprise to them.  According
    to the appellants, they had travelled with John and Granston on the subway
    to an apartment where Granston had said there was a party and free food.  The
    appellants testified that they were told to wait in the stairwell of the
    apartment building for Granston to return with the food.  While waiting in
    the stairwell, they heard a commotion outside the door.  A.R. opened the
    door to find Granston and John beating a pizza delivery man.  The appellants,
    in a panic, fled the scene, headed for the subway.  As shown on the video,
    they arrived at the subway with Granston and John.  The appellants were wearing
    bandanas over their face, but they explained that this was because of the
    cold, snowy weather conditions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A.R.
    testified that when they reached the subway, Granston made him take the backpack
    that contained the sawed off shotgun and the imitation handgun.  Granston
    also gave A.R. a cell phone, which A.R. later learned belonged to Mr. Cerdas.  S.S.
    testified that Granston made him carry the pizzas into the subway station.  The
    appellants testified that they feared Granston. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    examining the appellants’ evidence in detail, the trial judge rejected it
    almost in its entirety.  She gave extensive reasons for doing so.  On the
    totality of the evidence, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that A.R. had wielded the sawed off shotgun in both robberies.  The
    trial judge was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that S.S. was involved
    in the robbery of Mr. Cerdas.  She was, however, satisfied that he was involved
    in the pizza robbery.  The trial judge held that although S.S. did not personally
    possess a weapon, he was a party to the possession of the sawed off shotgun
    by A.R. in the second robbery.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h4>THE CONVICTION APPEAL:  THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, the trial judge admitted hearsay statements made by Mr.
    Cerdas and Granston for the truth of their contents.  Both statements figured
    prominently in the Crown’s case.  Without Mr. Cerdas’
    statement, there was virtually no evidence capable of establishing that he
    was robbed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that both statements qualified as admissible hearsay under
    the principled exception to the hearsay rule.  The appellants submitted at
    trial, and again on appeal, that neither statement was sufficiently reliable
    to warrant admission under the principled exception. </p>
  <h2>            (i)  Mr. Cerdas’ Statement</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Within
    approximately one hour of the robbery, Mr. Cerdas gave a statement to the
    police.  The statement was reduced to writing and signed by him.  It was
    not videotaped or audiotaped.  Mr. Cerdas was not under oath when he made
    the statement and was not cautioned as to the potential criminal liability
    should he deliberately lie to the police.  It turned out, however, that Mr.
    Cerdas had been convicted on two prior occasions for obstructing justice
    by lying to the police.  Based on these prior convictions, the trial judge
    found that Mr. Cerdas appreciated the significance of telling the truth in
    his statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Cerdas’ statement was about two-and-a-half pages long.  He described being
    robbed on the TTC bus by five or six young males.  He told the police that
    they had taken his earpiece, cell phone, watch, and a gold ring.  Mr. Cerdas
    provided a general description of four of the individuals involved in the
    attack.  He indicated that two were masked.  </p>

    Cerdas was called as a witness by the Crown.  He professed to have no recollection
    of the robbery or the statement.  He declined to read the statement while
    in the witness stand.  The trial judge ultimately found that Mr. Cerdas’ memory

    law pertaining to the manner in which the reliability of the hearsay statement
    is to be determined for the purposes of assessing admissibility was recently
    clarified in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.).  While <i>Khelawon</i> postdates
    the trial judge’s decision to admit these statements, her reasoning anticipated
    the clarification in <i>Khelawon</i> insofar as that clarification addresses
    the factors that are properly considered by a trial judge when determining
    whether a hearsay statement is sufficiently reliable to cross the admissibility
    barrier.  In <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 4, Charron J. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he factors
    to be considered on the admissibility inquiry cannot be characterized in

    the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence.</u>  In each case,

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Cerdas had no motive to lie to the police about being robbed or the particulars

  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Cerdas, because of his personal experience (two prior convictions for obstructing
    justice), was aware of the consequences of lying to the police even though  he
    was not cautioned about those consequences on this occasion;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    police officer who took the statement knew nothing about the events referred
    to in the statement.  That officer, and the police in general, had no suspects

    provide certain information that would incriminate individuals suspected

  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>In addition,
      there is also other corroborative real evidence which supports the reliability

      that a cell phone bearing Cerdas’ number and guns were found on a person
      fitting the general description of one of Cerdas’
    assailants approximately three hours later on T.T.C. property.  In addition,
    there is evidence that a ring, similar to Cerdas’ ring, was found in a crevice
    near a second male, who fled the same T.T.C. location at the same time.  Had
    Cerdas been available for meaningful cross-examination at trial, this other
    trial evidence would likely have narrowed the issues and therefore the scope
    of his cross-examination.  In this respect, the value of lost cross-examination
    in this area is less critical.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    statement have all been recognized as legally relevant to the reliability
    inquiry.  Nor did the trial judge fail to consider other relevant factors

    admissibility of a hearsay statement is ultimately a question of law and,
    therefore, reviewable on a correctness standard.  Part of that inquiry, however,
    requires the trial judge to weight various factors, some of which may point
    towards admissibility and others which may point against admissibility.  Trial
    judges cannot consult rules akin to mathematical formulas to tell them how
    much weight to give to each of the factors.  The assessment is case-specific.  Different

    find no error in the trial judge’s analysis of the legal principles governing
    the admissibility of Mr. Cerdas’
    statement.  She was aware that effective cross-examination of Mr. Cerdas
    was impossible.  The trial judge alluded repeatedly to the dangers inherent
    in the statement of a declarant who was not cross-examined when the statement
    was made and cannot be cross-examined at trial.  The factors identified by
    the trial judge as giving reliability to Mr. Cerdas’
    statement were all supported on the evidence and, as indicated above, legally
    relevant to the reliability inquiry.  The reasonableness of the trial judge’s
    assessment is placed beyond any dispute in light of the expanded review of
    the trial evidence mandated after <i>Khelawon</i>.  As the trial judge found,
    there is an impressive body of independent real evidence capable of enhancing
    the reliability of Mr. Cerdas’
    statement to the police, at least insofar as it described the robbery itself.  The
    statement was properly admitted.</p>

    we note that the trial judge ultimately used Mr. Cerdas’ statement only to
    establish that he was robbed and that the identified property was stolen
    from him during the robbery.  The trial judge did not use the contents of
    the statement to connect the appellants to the robbery.  It does not appear
    that the fact of the robbery was seriously disputed at trial.  The limited
    use to which the trial judge ultimately put the contents of Mr. Cerdas’ statement
    reduces any potential prejudice the appellants may have suffered by the admission
    of his statement to the police.  </p>

    gave a videotaped statement to the police very shortly after his arrest.  He
    described the two robberies (and a third a few days earlier that did not
    involve the appellants).  Prior to making the statement, Granston was cautioned
    and advised of his right to counsel.  He was not under oath when he made
    the statement, and he was not cautioned as to the consequences of making
    a false statement.  The videotape was played at trial, and the transcript
    of the interview was filed in evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Granston was called at trial by the Crown, he declined to answer questions
    put by the Crown.  According to him, his life was in danger if he “squealed”.  Under
    cross-examination on the <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility
    of the statement, Granston answered defence counsel’s questions concerning
    the circumstances surrounding his making of the videotaped statement to the
    police.  Many of Granston’s answers could potentially have assisted the defence
    in that they could have undermined the admissibility of his statement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel did not question Granston concerning the contents of the statement

    in the trial itself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    ruling on the admissibility of Granston’s videotaped statement, the trial
    judge had to consider whether Granston was available for cross-examination
    by the defence.  She observed that while Granston had firmly told the Crown
    he would not answer any questions, he had been helpful to the defence and
    had answered questions for defence counsel concerning the circumstances surrounding
    the making of his statement.  The trial judge went on to hold:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>Nevertheless,
    given his [Granston’s] refusal to answer any questions of substance in-chief,
    he was virtually unavailable to the Crown in the classic hearsay sense.  <u>It
    should be noted that none of the defence attempted to cross-examine Granston
    about the contents of his statements or the robberies.  In all of these circumstances,
    I am not prepared to assume that he would not have answered any defence questions
    about the statement contents or the robberies.</u>  Some attempt should have
    been made before such an inference can be drawn in this case given the inconsistency
    in his level of response to questions from the Crown and the defence.  [Emphasis

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear that Granston did not want to assist the Crown or appear to be assisting
    the Crown.  It is less clear that he was unprepared to testify about things
    that could potentially assist the defence.  In the circumstances, it was
    open to the trial judge to find that the defence had not shown that Granston
    was unavailable to them for cross-examination, at least to the extent that
    his evidence may have assisted the defence.  </p>

    defence’s decision not to pursue cross-examination of Granston on the contents
    of his statement on the robberies themselves was no doubt made for sound
    tactical reasons.  However, those reasons do not detract from the reasonableness
    of the trial judge’s inference from the manner in which Granston conducted
    himself on the witness stand.  In the absence of any attempt to elicit testimony
    from Granston, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that it could not
    be said that he was unavailable to the defence for cross-examination on the
    statement and the circumstances of the robberies.  </p>

  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other

    were striking similarities between Granston’s description of the three robberies

  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    videotape demonstrated that Granston was alert, calm and collected throughout
    his interview with the police.  That interview was conducted in a professional
    manner with no inappropriate police conduct.  The statement was voluntary.</p>

    factors identified by the trial judge were supported by the evidence and
    legally relevant to the assessment of the reliability of Granston’s videotaped
    statement.  The trial judge did not misapprehend any evidence material to
    her finding of reliability.  Her assessment of the weight to be assigned

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    appellants challenge the duration of their youth sentences on the basis that
    the trial judge improperly relied on general deterrence as a relevant sentencing
    objective.  The appellants also argue that the sentences imposed were unreasonable.  In
    addition, A.R. argues that the trial judge erred by imposing a sentence that
    exceeds the sentence proposed by the Crown without giving reasons for doing
    so.  Irrespective of the appropriateness of the sentences at the time they
    were imposed by the trial judge, the appellants argue on the basis of fresh
    evidence that this court should reduce their sentences. </p>

    Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in her reliance on general deterrence.  At
    the time, the trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s decision eschewing general deterrence as a factor in youth sentencing.  In <i>R.
    v. P.(B.W.)</i>; <i>R. v. N.(B.V.)</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d)  97 at para.
    4 the court observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>The <i>YCJA</i> … sets
    out a detailed and complete code for sentencing young persons under which
    terms it is not open to the youth sentencing judge to impose a punishment
    for the purpose of warning, not the young person, but others against engaging
    in criminal conduct. <u>Hence, general deterrence is not a principle of youth
    sentencing under the present regime</u>.  [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of <i>P.(B.W.)</i>, the trial judge’s references to general deterrence
    are an error in principle.  Despite this error, it is our view that the sentences
    imposed were fit at the time they were imposed, subject to the adjustment
    of A.R.’s sentence to comply with the sentence sought by the Crown.  As the
    trial judge observed, these offences were robberies against vulnerable victims.  They
    were serious offences that involved the use of firearms.  A.R. was in possession
    of two firearms and used one of them to gratuitously beat and injure Mr.
    Stankov.  Mr. Stankov never returned to his job delivering pizzas.  S.S.
    participated in the second robbery and was a party to the firearms offences.  </p>

    trial judge designated certain of the offences as serious violent offences.  She
    also noted the planned nature of the second robbery.  The trial judge also
    took into account the appellants’ circumstances.  She expressed concern about
    the appellants’ failure to accept responsibility for their participation.  She
    also considered the appellants’ ages, their out-of-character conduct in committing
    these offences, their differing levels of participation in the offences,
    their supportive families, and their significant prospects for rehabilitation.  On
    the question of parity, the trial judge considered the 54-month global sentence
    imposed on an adult participant in related robberies, while also recognizing
    that the adult had a criminal record and that the appellants did not.  </p>

    primary goal of sentencing under the <i>YCJA</i> is set out in s. 38(1):</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences)
    is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition
    of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person
    and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society,
    thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    objectives of rehabilitation and reintegration are important.  In addition
    to these objectives, the <i>YCJA</i> provides for a sentence that punishes
    the accused and denounces the offences.  It requires the imposition of
    “meaningful consequences”.  In our view, and subject to A.R.’s separate ground
    of appeal regarding the length of sentence, the sentences imposed by the
    trial judge properly reflected these objectives and were reasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    addressing the appellants’ sentences individually, we note that the trial
    judge was cognizant of the effect of the two-year passage of time between
    the date of the offences and the date of sentencing when she considered the
    appropriate sentences for the appellants.  She specifically recognized the
    importance of dealing with young offenders quickly.  This is because sections
    3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the <i>YCJA</i> provide for <span style='"Times New Roman"'>“timely
    intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and
    its consequences”</span> and the need for prompt proceedings in light of “young
    persons’ perception of time”.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    has been an additional delay of almost three years pending appeal.  A considerable
    part of that delay was attributable to transcript production; however, it
    appears that appellants’ counsel did not request any priority for transcripts
    and, even after their delivery, counsel took seven months to prepare their
    facta.  Nor did the Crown take any steps to attempt to expedite the appeals.  Under
    the current system, the court responds to requests to expedite appeals but
    seldom takes the initiative to do so.  Perhaps this should change.  </p>

    may be reasonable to infer from this delay that the appellants were not anxious
    to have their appeals resolved in a timely fashion because they were on relatively
    favourable terms of interim release and further delay worked in their favour
    to bolster the evidence supporting their rehabilitation.  In addition, the
    Crown was not apparently concerned about this delay.  Nonetheless, the passage
    of more than five years since the offences is an important consideration
    when addressing the present fitness of the appellants’ sentences, particularly
    given their very positive life styles while on release.  As well, the passage
    of time at the critical age of these appellants promotes confidence that
    their rehabilitation will endure.  However, no matter how laudable the appellants’ rehabilitation – and
    their rehabilitation is laudable – it is not the sole consideration relevant
    to sentencing. </p>

    reduced to reflect the 24 months proposed by the Crown, comprised of six
    months of secure custody, ten months of open custody, and eight months of
    community supervision.  </p>

    was 17 years old at the time of the offences, 19 at the time of sentencing,
    and is now 22 years old.  At the time of sentencing, as evidenced by the
    pre-sentence report, A.R. had matured and begun to achieve a successful rehabilitation,
    subject to his lack of acceptance of responsibility for the offences.  </p>

    argues that his sentence should be reduced in light of his fresh evidence
    about his successful rehabilitation.  He has been employed full time for
    the past two years, currently in home renovations and construction.  He intends
    to become a carpenter.  He has completed 26 credits towards his high school
    diploma.  He has a four-month old son whom he visits regularly and for whom
    he pays child support.  A.R. continues to live at home where his family provides
    him strong support.  He pays rent and helps with the household.  Pending
    the appeal, A.R. has served approximately 18 days in custody.  For the first
    year after his release pending appeal, A.R. was on strict terms of bail amounting
    to house arrest.  He has complied with his terms of release.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of A.R.’s rehabilitation, his time served and his one year of house
    arrest, his counsel seeks a sentence of time served together with an order
    for community supervision.  The Crown does not dispute A.R.’s rehabilitation,
    nor does it dispute that it is open to this court to take into consideration
    the period of house arrest.  However, the Crown argues that a period of incarceration
    is necessary to punish A.R. for these violent crimes.  We agree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    custodial sentence is necessary to express a strong denunciation for these
    offences, to hold A.R. accountable, and to provide “meaningful consequences
    for his actions”.  Nonetheless, in our view, A.R.’s incarceration does not
    need to be in a closed prison setting.  Returning A.R. to prison, even youth
    prison, would not promote, and may hinder, his rehabilitation.  Since the
    purpose of youth sentencing is the long-term protection of society through
    rehabilitation, reintegration and meaningful consequences, it would be contrary
    to the public interest to risk A.R.’s rehabilitation and his reintegration
    into society by placing him in prison five years after the offences.  Such
    a disposition would not meet the <i>YCJA’s</i> objectives of “timely intervention” nor
    accord with a young person’s “perception of time”.  A 22 year old is a different
    person than a 17 year old.  Moreover, on the evidence before us, a secure
    setting is not necessary for the protection of the public.  It would also
    remove A.R. (as it would S.S.) from familial supports, which are important
    for his continued rehabilitation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principles of sentencing can best be fulfilled at this juncture by a period
    of open custody followed by community supervision.  This disposition will
    keep A.R. near his family.  We understand that, subject to the supervising
    authorities’ option to have A.R. serve his sentence in an adult jail, open
    custody will allow the authorities to incarcerate A.R. in a non-prison residential
    setting.  In that setting, the authorities can structure terms of incarceration
    commensurate with his rehabilitation based on their assessment of his progress.  This
    sentence may permit him to maintain his employment.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of A.R.’s post-sentencing rehabilitation and his one year of house
    arrest, an appropriate sentence at this time would be one of ten months open
    custody to be followed by five months of community supervision.  We understand
    that A.R. will be given credit from this sentence for the approximately 18
    days of time he has already served. </p>
  <h3>(ii)       S.S.’s sentence </h3>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.S.
    was sentenced regarding five offences in relation to the robbery of Mr. Stankov.  S.S.
    played a less significant role in the offences than did A.R., although he
    was a party to the weapons offences.  For the reasons we have already given,
    we are of the view that S.S.’s sentence of 15 months, comprised of six months
    secure custody, four months open custody and five months of community supervision<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> was appropriate at the time of sentencing in light
    of the relevant factors.  Like A.R., S.S. did not express an appreciation
    of his accountability for the offences, apart from expressing sympathy for
    the impact on the victim.  His pre-sentence report describes him as attributing
    his offences simply to
    “following his friends”.  S.S. has served approximately one month of closed
    custody and two years on bail amounting to house arrest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.S.
    has also filed fresh evidence that supports his successful rehabilitation.  He
    also was 17 at the time of the offences, 19 at the time of sentencing, and
    is currently 22 years old.  Since his release pending appeal, S.S. has complied
    with all the terms of his release orders.  He continues to live with his
    mother, grandmother, four siblings, uncle, and cousin.  He has completed
    grade 12 and has been employed full time since June 2006.  Since August 2007,
    S.S. has been working as a labourer rebuilding transmissions.  The Crown
    does not dispute S.S.’s successful rehabilitation but, again, emphasizes
    the goal of holding S.S. accountable for these offences through the provision
    of meaningful consequences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the Crown that, while S.S.’s rehabilitation is important, he must
    be held accountable for his involvement in these offences.  In our view,
    in light of S.S.’s current circumstances, including his two years of house
    arrest, a proper sentence is one of four months open custody followed by
    two months of community supervision.  We understand that S.S. will be credited
    for the time he has served since sentencing, which we are told is approximately
    five weeks. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    emphasize that the sentences imposed by the trial judge for these very serious
    offences were appropriate when imposed.  Our disposition reflects the significant
    change in circumstances since the trial judge imposed her dispositions.  The
    appellants have shown substantial rehabilitative progress.  In a very real
    sense, they are no longer the persons they were when they were before the
    trial judge.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeals from the convictions are dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is
    granted, the appeal allowed, and the sentence regarding duration is varied
    to accord with these reasons.</p>

    also argued that the trial judge should have declared a mistrial when the
    Crown inadvertently failed to disclose certain photographs of the scene of
    one of the robberies until A.R. was under cross-examination.  We doubt that
    the late disclosure could possibly have prejudiced A.R.  In any event, the
    trial judge fashioned a remedy that avoided any possible prejudice.  We did
    not call on the Crown on this issue.</p>
