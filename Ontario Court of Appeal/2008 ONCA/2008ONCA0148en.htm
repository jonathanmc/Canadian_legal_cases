  <p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Colin Campbell of the Superior Court
    of Justice dated March 22, 2007.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-weight:normal;'>ROULEAU J.A.:</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals an order dated March 22, 2007 granting summary judgment
    to the respondents, Farzana Nabizada and Seena Nasrati, and dismissing the
    appellant’s action.  Since the defendants Babubhai Patel and CDN Business
    Investor Corp. did not participate in the motion, the action against them
    continues.  In his grounds of appeal, the appellant asks not only that the
    decision of the motion judge be set aside, but also that judgment on the
    merits be granted in his favour.  </p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The instant proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these proceedings the appellant sought an order rescinding the sale of his
    property and awarding him general damages of $1,500,000.  In 2006, Babubhai
    Patel, a mortgage creditor, sold the property to the respondents through
    a power of sale.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    were bilingual proceedings conducted under s. 126 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  Three motions were scheduled for January
    11, 2007, two in this case and one in another file involving the appellant.  Before
    the hearing, the appellant was notified that a bilingual judge would not
    be available to hear the motions.  On the hearing date, the appellant’s agent
    appeared and requested that the hearing of the motions be adjourned to a
    later date when a bilingual judge would be available.</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The decision below</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge, who was not bilingual, denied the appellant’s motion for an
    adjournment and proceeded to hear the three scheduled motions including the
    motion now under appeal.  In that motion, the respondents sought the dismissal
    of the claim pursuant to rules 20 and 21.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge explained that a bilingual judge was not available and that
    in his opinion, the appellant was “attempting to manipulate the bilingual
    obligation of provincial laws to his own purpose” in order to delay the proceedings.  The
    motion judge stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[2]       The
    motions in this and a related matter were returnable on a day on which a
    French-speaking judge was unavailable.  The actions of Mr. Ndem were responsible
    for that unavailability.  In various proceedings in this Court, including
    this action, Mr. Ndem has objected to the presence of more than 16 individual
    judges as not being qualified to preside due to inadequacy in the French
    language.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[3]       On
    at least three occasions, bilingual judges from outside Toronto have made
    special arrangements to preside, only to meet with complaint about their
    French speaking ability, or on occasion when Mr. Ndem did not appear, later
    providing a less than adequate excuse.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[4]       Prior to the return of this motion, I was advised by the only
    bilingual judges available that due to Mr. Ndem’s previous complaint, they
    did not wish to preside.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge stated that in order to understand the appellant’s position,
    he had obtained assistance from the respondents’
    counsel and also, “to the extent required,” had had the appellant’s written
    submissions translated into English.  The motion judge also noted that to
    the best of his knowledge, the appellant was bilingual and that, moreover,
    an interpreter was available in the courtroom.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    although it was a bilingual proceeding and the statement of claim and several
    documents in the file were written only in French, the motions were heard
    by a unilingual judge.  In the result, the respondents’ motion was granted
    and the appellant’s action against them was dismissed.  Although the appellant
    had filed a cross-motion, it appears that the cross-motion was not heard.</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals (in part) on the basis that the motion judge’s failure
    to adjourn the proceedings and to refer the matter to a bilingual judge violated
    the appellant’s right to a bilingual proceeding under s.<span style='font-family:Sylfaen;'> 126
    of the </span><i>Courts of Justice Act</i><span
style='font-family:Sylfaen;'>.  </span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>He argues
    that since this is a fundamental right, the appeal should be allowed without
    proof that he suffered prejudice.  For the reasons that follow, I agree with
    the appellant and would therefore allow the appeal.  </span></p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>1)        </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Motions
      before the Court of Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Two
      other motions were heard at the same time as this appeal.  The first was
      a motion brought by the respondents to admit fresh evidence, specifically,
      two letters the appellant wrote after release of the decision under appeal.  In
      my opinion, this evidence should not be admitted since it would not have
      had any effect on the outcome of the case: see <i>Palmer v. The Queen</i>,
      [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at 775.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      second was a cross-motion brought by the appellant.  In his written submissions
      in support of the cross-motion, the appellant not only asks the court to
      dismiss the motion for fresh evidence, but also to act as a court of first
      instance and to render a just decision on the merits.  The appellant does
      not, however, state the decision on the merits he is seeking nor does he
      explain how this relief is available on a motion to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>In
      my view, the appellant’s cross-motion is misconceived.  Because I have
      already dismissed the respondents’ fresh evidence motion and because there
      is no basis upon which this court can grant the balance of the relief sought
      in the appellant’s cross-motion, I would dismiss the cross-motion. </span></p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>2)        </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The
      appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents submit that the appeal should be dismissed for the following
    reasons:</p>
  <p>a)         the motion judge correctly concluded that an adjournment should
    not be granted because the appellant had abused the process and because this
    abuse:</p>
  <p>(i)        had the effect of preventing any bilingual judge from hearing
    the motions; and </p>
  <p>(ii)       warranted the sanction of a denial of his right to be heard by
    a bilingual judge;</p>
  <p>b)         in the alternative, even if the motion judge had erred, the appeal
    should nevertheless be dismissed because the appellant did not suffer any
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>I will consider both arguments below.</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>a)         </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Refusal
      to grant the adjournment</span></h4>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(i)        </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Appellant’s
      complaints</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge referred to the difficulties many judges encountered
    in cases involving the appellant and the fact that the appellant had complained
    about their French language skills.  Although the motion judge made these
    comments, there is nothing in the record that would allow us to assess these
    assertions.  Specifically, there is nothing in the record to indicate what
    happened before the motion judge or to verify the complaints that the appellant
    has apparently filed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>In
      my view, the fact that</span> the appellant has complained about the French
      language skills of several
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto judges does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that all the bilingual
    judges in the region are precluded from hearing cases involving him.  In
    fact, the appellant even criticized the motion judge who nevertheless proceeded
    to hear the motions.  What’s more, the appellant has criticized judges of
    this court and still these judges continue to hear his appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s comments might be read as suggesting that the appellant’s
    criticisms amounted to an allegation of bias.  However, criticism of a judge
    or an allegation of bias should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
    a judge cannot preside, especially when this would lead to the loss of the
    right to a bilingual proceeding.  Instead, a judge faced with such an allegation
    should receive supporting evidence and then decide, on a case by case basis,
    whether to recuse himself or herself.</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>(ii)       </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Did
      the judge have the jurisdiction to deny the right to a bilingual proceeding?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    right to a bilingual proceeding is conferred by s. 126 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i> which reads, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'><b>126.</b> (1)
    A party to a proceeding who speaks French has the right to require that it
    be conducted as a bilingual proceeding.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(2) The following rules apply to a proceeding that is conducted as a bilingual
    proceeding:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>1.   The hearings
    that the party specifies shall be presided over by a judge or officer who
    speaks English and French.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    this provision, the respondents maintain that no right is absolute and that
    where there has been an abuse of process, the court may deny the right to
    bilingual proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the right in s. 126 is not qualified by any grant of judicial discretion.  Although
    it is true that the court has the inherent jurisdiction to control the conduct
    of the proceedings, it is also clear that the court’s jurisdiction cannot
    be exercised in a manner that would conflict with the express provisions
    of a statute.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What’s
    more, a court has other means at its disposal to address a litigant’s abuse
    of process.  For example, the court may deny the litigant’s application for
    an adjournment, stay the proceedings, or find the abuse to constitute a contempt
    of court.  Moreover, the court may also prohibit a vexatious litigant from
    continuing the proceedings or initiating others.  These provisions (and others)
    enable the court to control its process and to prevent abuse without violating

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 15, this court stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where, as in
    this case, the appellant has met the procedural requirements to trigger a
    right to a bilingual hearing, this right is more than purely procedural,
    it is substantive and the appropriate remedy is to set aside the order<i><span style='font-family:&quot;ANOMEK+TimesNewRoman\,Italic&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    in my view, the appropriate disposition is to set aside the order and to
    refer the matter back to the court below.  English and French are the official
    languages of the courts in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, and the court has a responsibility to ensure compliance with language
    rights under s. 126 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  A proper interpretation
    of this provision is one that is consistent with the preservation and development
    of official language communities in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and with the respect and preservation of their cultures: see <i>Beaulac</i>,
    at paras. 25, 34 and 45.  Violation of these rights, which are quasi-constitutional
    in nature, constitutes material prejudice to the linguistic minority.  A
    court would be undermining the importance of these rights if, in circumstances
    where the decision rendered on the merits was correct, the breach of the
    right to a bilingual proceeding was tolerated and the breach was not remedied.  </p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>c)         </span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Additional
      observations</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the above reasons, I conclude that the appeal should be allowed.  I am nonetheless
    mindful of the history of this case and do not turn a blind eye to the appellant’s
    conduct.  To a certain extent, it would appear that he is responsible for
    some of the difficulties which arose in this case.  Many different bilingual
    judges have presided over the appellant’s cases.  As noted by the motion
    judge, in almost every instance the appellant has either criticized the judge
    or sent letters of complaint to various authorities, and has demanded the
    assignment of another judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has moderated his position somewhat in this appeal.  He has noted
    in his factum that [TRANSLATION] “Many judges are the subject of criticism
    and this does not prevent them from presiding dispassionately and with total
    impartiality”.  He has also acknowledged that, given the principle of judicial
    independence, a complaint to the Minister of Justice does not affect the
    judge’s partiality.  Despite this, the appellant should appreciate that the
    judges targeted by his criticisms will inevitably be hearing the various
    motions and proceedings in which he is involved.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude with the observation that it is somewhat troubling that although
    the motions below were brought as part of a bilingual proceeding with sufficient
    notice, no bilingual judge was available to hear them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
