    appellant was found guilty of robbery with a firearm (x3); robbery with an
    imitation firearm (x3); robbery (x3); point firearm (x4); disguise with intent
    (x8); and possession of a weapon for the purpose of committing an offence
    (x3).  He was sentenced to 8 years in custody in addition to pre-trial custody
    of 5 years.  The appellant appeals the convictions and seeks leave to appeal

    appellant raises two issues in respect of his conviction appeals.  First,
    he argues that the trial judge erred in determining that the gun before the
    court was a
    “firearm”, as that word is defined in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Second,
    the appellant argues that because the <i>voir dires</i> were improperly conducted,
    the trial judge erred in admitting the out of court statements of David Caesar
    and Mohammad Ahmad for the truth of their contents. <u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>The Firearm Issue</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concedes that there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge
    to find that the gun in evidence was that which had been used in the three
    robberies in counts 1, 9 and 23.  However, that gun had no breech bolt.  Without
    a breech bolt, the gun was not operable as it was not capable of being fired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    expert evidence established that it is easy to insert a breech bolt and,
    thus, to make the gun operable.  The expert also testified that breech bolts
    could be readily obtained.  He testified that with one phone call to a store
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Orillia, he found he could have a breech bolt shipped in a matter of days
    at a cost of $40.  There was no need for a permit for such a purchase.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no evidence that a breech bolt was available during the robberies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Covin</i> (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3) 240 S.C.C. at p. 243, Lamer C.J. explained
      how to determine whether an inoperable gun is a firearm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“If inoperable, then as regards s. 83, it is a
    firearm if, given the nature of the repairs or modifications required and
    the availability of the parts on the scene, whatever was used could, during
    the commission of the offence have been adapted by an ordinary person or
    by the accused if possessing special skills so as to be capable of firing
    and of causing serious injury.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, as has been noted, there was no evidence that parts were
    available “on the scene … during the commission of the offence” that could
    have been used to make the gun operable.  As the above extract from <i>Covin </i>makes
    clear, in order for an inoperable weapon to be a firearm as that word is
    defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the parts must be available
    “on the scene” so that the weapon could be made operable during the commission
    of the offence.  There was no such evidence therefore, in our view, the trial
    judge erred in finding that the rifle in question was a “firearm” within
    the meaning of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the Crown’s alternative argument for the same reasons.  The alternative
    argument which again was based on the expert evidence, was that the rifle
    could have been fired by striking a nail against the cartridge.  Setting
    aside the very real question as to whether such an adaptation could have
    been made during a robbery, there was no evidence that a nail and something
    suitable to strike it with was available on the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the convictions on counts 1, 9 and 23 (robbery with a firearm) must be quashed.  We
    would substitute convictions for robbery with an imitation firearm on those
    counts.  It follows that the convictions for pointing a firearm (counts 2
    and 10) must be quashed and acquittals entered on those counts.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, this court is required to sentence the appellant for robbery with
    an imitation firearm on counts 1, 9 and 23.  We impose a sentence of four
    years on each count, concurrent to each other.  This is consistent with the
    trial judge’s sentence for counts 4, 15 and 18, which are also robbery with
    an imitation firearm.</p>
  <h3><u>The <i>Voir Dire</i> Issue</u></h3>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal;
'>The KGB statement of David Caesar</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Calarco submits that the trial judge applied a flawed procedure with respect
    to the statement of Mr. Caesar, mixing the Crown’s s. 9(2) and <i>KGB</i> applications.  In
    particular, he argues that Crown counsel was allowed to embark upon an impermissible
    cross-examination of her own witness, Mr. Caesar, on the <i>voir dire</i>.  He
    contends that the allegedly flawed procedure so undermined the trial process
    that defence counsel’s admission of “necessity” on the <i>KGB</i> application
    must not be allowed to stand.  Since the necessity requirement would then
    not be met, the argument goes, the statement was inadmissible for the truth
    of its contents and – since the statement formed the only basis for identifying
    the appellant as a participant in the robberies – the convictions must fall.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the <i>KGB</i> application, defence counsel conceded that the requirement
    of “necessity” had been met.  The underlying basis for this concession was
    that, at trial, Mr. Caesar recanted his earlier statement that the appellant
    was present at the robberies.  That this was so was readily apparent on the
    evidence <u>before</u> Crown counsel embarked upon her s. 9(2) and <i>KGB</i> applications.  The
    following exchange during Mr. Caesar’s examination in chief (at p. 864) illustrates
    this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will
    it help you to refresh your memory if you were allowed to read about the
    second robbery that you told the police about?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
    you should tell me.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    you mean by that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
    tell me what it is.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court:      Well do you want to read it to
    see if it does help?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    really, no.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Hughes: Q. Why not?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    I don’t feel I need to because the whole statement is wrong.  The names in
    it, it’s wrong.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ok.  So
    by that, what you mean? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    the names that are in it shouldn’t be in it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whose
    name in particular? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    Marvin’s [i.e. the appellant’s] and Bradley’s.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marvin’s
    and Bradley’s name shouldn’t be in the statement at all?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.    Not, not in all, not Marvin’s name in all,
    but Bradley should be in for one, one or two of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, nothing that transpired during the s. 9(2)/<i>KGB</i> voir dire – whether
    arising from the Crown’s cross-examining Mr. Caesar or not – altered the
    already established point that Mr. Caesar was resiling from his earlier statement
    regarding the appellant’s presence at the robberies and, therefore, that
    the criterion for
    “necessity” with respect to the statement was met.  We see no prejudice to
    the appellant in this respect from the s.&nbsp;9(2)/<i>KGB</i> procedure,
    whether it was flawed or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the trial judge’s findings regarding the
    “reliability” of Mr. Caesar’s arise out of any evidence that could be said
    to have been tainted by a flawed s. 9(2)/<i>KGB</i> procedure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not disturb the trial judge’s ruling with respect to the admissibility
    of Mr. Caesar’s statement.   </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The KGB statement of Mr. Ahmad</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor
      would we interfere with the trial judge’s ruling regarding the admissibility
      of Mr. Ahmad’s statement on a </span><i>KGB</i> basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant concedes that the procedure followed with respect to Mr. Ahmad’s
    statement was not flawed to the same degree as that which was followed in
    respect of Mr. Caesar.  Mr. Calarco argues, however, that the trial judge
    erred (a) in permitting Crown counsel to cross-examine on “consistencies” between
    Mr. Ahmad’s evidence and his statement, and (b) in misconstruing the test
    for admissibility of a <i>KGB</i> statement by concluding that various leading
    questions posed by the police during the taking of the statement “did not
    affect voluntariness”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    we do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge placed no reliance on the
    “consistencies”, either in his ruling in respect of the admissibility of
    Mr. Ahmad’s statement or in his ultimate reasons for conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge made no error in his treatment of the leading question issue.  He
    concluded that while the police had engaged in some leading questions during
    the taking of the statement, those questions did not affect the
    “voluntariness” of the statement.  Mr. Calarco concedes that “voluntariness” is
    a proper consideration under the heading of “reliability” on a <i>KGB</i> application,
    but he submits that the trial judge mistakenly conflated
    “voluntariness” and “reliability” in this portion of his reasons, thereby
    applying the wrong test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear when reading the trial judge’s reference to leading questions and
    voluntariness in context, however – it takes place under the rubric of his
    four-point analysis of the reliability of Mr. Ahmad’s statement – that he
    did no such thing.  The trial judge considered whether the statement was “voluntary” as
    an aspect of reliability, as he was entitled to do, and dealt with the argument
    about leading questions in that context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.   </p>
  <h3><u>The Sentence Appeal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentences on the remaining counts for
    which convictions stand, on the basis that the overall sentence was excessive.  We
    disagree.  We see no basis upon which to interfere with the discretion exercised
    by the trial judge.  Given the number and serious nature of the offences,
    the appellant’s prior record, the vulnerability of and the impact on the
    victims, and the degree of planning involved in the offences, the total sentence
    imposed was not excessive despite the appellant’s youth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in his failure to give
    credit on a three for one basis in respect of his pre-trial custody in the
    Don Jail.  Counsel relies upon the trial judge’s judgment in <i>R. v. R.L.</i>,
    [2004] O.J. No. 384 where such credit was given to an accused for time served
    in the Don Jail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for sentence in this case, the trial judge adverted to his decision
    in <i>R.L.</i> and declined to give three for one credit for the entire pre-trial
    custody time spent in the Don Jail.  However, he did give three for one credit
    for the period of time that the jail routine was disrupted by the SARS crisis.  For
    the balance of the appellant’s pre-trial custody, he gave the usual two for
    one credit.  Again, we see no error in the exercise of his discretion.</p>
  <h3><u>Disposition</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would allow the conviction appeal in part, grant leave to appeal sentence
    but dismiss the sentence appeal.  As a result of the appeal, the convictions
    and sentences are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>Robbery with an imitation firearm: 4 years concurrent
    on each count (1, 9, 23)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>Robbery with an imitation firearm: 4 years concurrent
    to each other (4, 15, 18) but consecutive to the foregoing robbery counts</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
