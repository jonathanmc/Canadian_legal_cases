    is an appeal from a conviction for the first degree murder of Pearl Pettitt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, this case was simple and straightforward.  The appellant admitted
    causing Ms. Pettitt’s death and sexually assaulting her, although he asserted
    that he could recall neither event as the result of an alcohol induced blackout.  His
    trial counsel conceded that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter and
    sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only real issue at trial was whether the appellant had the intent required
    for murder.  The theory of the defence was that the Crown had failed to meet
    its burden on intent either as the result of the appellant’s alleged intoxication
    and/or because the nature of the bodily harm caused by the appellant was
    not such that one should infer from it that he knew it was likely to cause
    death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>instructing
    the jury on the “common sense inference” because death, as caused, could
    not have been a natural or probable consequence of his actions; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>his instructions
    on intoxication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Common Sense Inference</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court did not call on the Crown to respond to the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the argument that, in the circumstances of this case, it was an error
    to include the common sense inference instruction in the charge.  It is worth
    noting that in the pre-charge conference, experienced defence counsel had
    the opportunity to review and comment on two written drafts of the key aspects
    of the proposed charge.  Defence counsel did not object to the permissive
    inference being left with the jury.  He did ask that certain changes be made.  The
    trial judge accepted those submissions and incorporated the requested changes
    into the charge.  Further, defence counsel conceded that the Crown did not
    have to prove that the appellant foresaw the specific mechanism of death
    (<i>i.e.</i> aspiration by vomit) only that he had to foresee the likelihood
    of death as a result of the bodily harm he caused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the events in question, the appellant was 19 years old.  He was
    a labourer and in good physical condition.  He was 50 years younger than
    Ms. Pettitt, a petite, elderly woman in poor health.  The appellant beat
    Ms. Pettitt about the head.  She died as result of the injuries he caused,
    as he admitted when he acknowledged that causation was not an issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the pathologist said that listing aspiration as the sole cause of death was
    something that he had never done before, he repeatedly testified that the
    reason Ms. Pettitt aspirated her stomach contents was the blunt force trauma
    that the appellant had inflicted on her.  What he called the “terminal event”
    (aspirating vomit) took place as a consequence of her reduced state of consciousness,
    which caused her gag reflex to fail.  The head injuries she received during
    this attack caused the reduced consciousness.  While the pathologist thought
    that the head injuries also caused her to vomit, he agreed with defence counsel’s
    suggestion that revulsion and anxiety caused by the attack may have contributed
    to her vomiting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the charge, the trial judge reminded the jury that the pathologist testified
    that aspiration of vomit is seldom the sole cause of death in a homicide.  He
    also reminded the jury of the competing inferences that the parties said
    arose on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, we do not accept that because the appellant might not
    have been able to foresee specifically how Ms. Pettitt would die, her death
    could not be a likely consequence of his acts.  It was an inference that
    the jury could draw and was properly placed before them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>INTOXICATION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s chief argument on intoxication is that the language used by the
    trial judge placed an onus on the defence to establish that the appellant
    was intoxicated.  In making this argument, he relies primarily on the following
    line (from p. 126) of the charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If, however, after considering all of the evidence,
    you find that Mr. Robson was intoxicated you will ask yourselves what effect,
    if any, that had on whether he in fact formed the intent required by the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.  When the charge is read as a whole, we see no reasonable possibility
    that the jury could have understood that there was an onus on the appellant
    to prove intoxication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The
    trial judge repeatedly advised the jury that the burden was on the Crown
    beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant “does not have to prove that
    he is not guilty of the crimes with which he is charged”, and that the appellant “need
    prove nothing in this case”.  The trial judge also repeatedly told the jury
    that it was for the Crown to prove intention beyond a reasonable doubt, and
    that the Crown bore the burden of proof throughout the case.  He gave a faultless <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the instruction on intoxication is very similar to that which the Supreme
    Court of Canada recently held to be appropriate in <i>R. v. Daley</i>, [2007]
    S.C.R. 53.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    instruction on intoxication differs from that in <i>R. v. Kennedy</i> [1987]
    O.J. 1135 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In <i>Kennedy</i><b>, </b>the trial judge neglected to instruct the jury
    about the impact that intoxication might have on intent.  That error was
    not made in the present case.  In this case, the trial judge clearly instructed
    the jury to consider the issue of the appellant’s alleged intoxication and
    to find to what extent, if at all, it impacted on the appellant.  The jury
    was then instructed to ask themselves whether that impact assisted in deciding
    whether the appellant meant to cause Pearl Pettitt’s death or whether he
    meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause her death
    and was reckless whether death ensured.  In examining the question whether
    he knew that bodily harm was likely to cause her death, the jury was reminded
    to bear in mind defence counsel’s closing submissions on the pathologist’s
    evidence as to the actual cause of death.  He then summarised that evidence.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we would again note that experienced defence counsel at trial raised no objection
    in the pre-charge conference nor following the charge on this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><u>DISPOSITION</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
