    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence by Echlin J. for sexual assault.  This
    is a historical sexual assault.  The complainant testified that approximately
    seventeen or eighteen years before the trial, the appellant, then her employer,
    came to her apartment late in the evening and raped her.  The appellant admitted
    to having sexual intercourse with the complainant on one occasion in her
    apartment, but claimed that it was consensual.  A great deal of evidence
    was adduced at trial about the statements and conduct of the complainant
    both before the incident and in the years after.  This evidence was adduced
    under the general rubric of narrative.  The principal ground of appeal concerns
    the use the trial judge made of this evidence in concluding that the complainant’s
    account was credible and reliable.  The appellant also raises several other
    concerns about the trial judge’s reasons and seeks to introduce fresh evidence
    concerning statements made by the complainant after trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I would not admit the fresh evidence and would dismiss
    the appeal from conviction.  While I would grant leave to appeal sentence,
    I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first blush, much of the evidence adduced at trial seems to be of only tenuous
    relevance.  It relates to the complainant’s conduct and view of herself both
    before and after the alleged assault.  However, the relevance of this evidence
    becomes clear in light of the positions taken by the parties, especially
    the position taken by the defence.  The complainant presented herself as
    a naïve woman who was saving herself for marriage and who would not have
    engaged in sexual intercourse outside of marriage.  She claimed that as a
    result of the rape, her character completely changed: she went from being
    outgoing and friendly to being withdrawn, drinking to excess and using drugs.  She
    also testified that she suffered a miscarriage three to four months after
    the assault as a result of being impregnated by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence portrayed the complainant as a very different person.  The appellant
    testified that she regularly used drugs, and even supplied him with drugs.  He
    stated that they regularly engaged in affectionate activity, short of intercourse,
    and used drugs and drank during working hours and afterwards.  After what
    he said was a consensual act of intercourse, he claims that the complainant
    tried to engage him in a serious relationship.  He refused, which he says
    explains her character change.  When she later had a miscarriage and ensuing
    health problems, she came to view the consensual encounter as a sexual assault.</p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the offence, the complainant was twenty-seven or twenty-eight
    years old.  She had emigrated from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Ireland</st1:country-region>
    without any other family and described herself as naïve and a good girl as
    a result of her convent schooling.  She had trained in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region>
    as a hairstylist and she found a job in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto working for the appellant at his salon.  At the time, she was in
    a long-term relationship with D.S., although both parties described it as
    somewhat “on-again/off-again.”  The complainant testified that she was a
    virgin and that while she and D.S. were intimate, they had never engaged
    in sexual intercourse.  She was also adamant that D.S. had never stayed over
    at her apartment.  Although D.S. confirmed that they had never engaged in
    sexual intercourse, he testified that he did stay over at her apartment over
    a dozen times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant conceded that she was flirtatious with the appellant but said
    that she rebuffed some of his more aggressive advances, such as his attempts
    to hug her.  She denied being intimate with the appellant and essentially
    denied that she had used drugs before the assault.  I say
    “essentially” because in cross-examination she appeared to admit that she
    might have used marijuana a “[v]ery little[, t]iny” bit before the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 2:00 a.m. one evening in 1987 or 1988, the appellant unexpectedly appeared
    at her apartment building.  The security guard called up to her apartment
    and said that the appellant did not look okay.  The complainant told the
    guard to let him up.  In the meantime, she put on some pants and a shirt.  She
    let him in to her apartment and within minutes the appellant ripped off her
    clothes and raped her.  He spat on her and told her that he knew she was
    a virgin.  The complainant went out to the balcony.  The appellant followed
    her out, put his arms around her and said he was sorry he could not spend
    the night.  He then left.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was devastated by the attack. She testified that she “went into
    this sort of warp” and her character changed completely.  She did not return
    to work at the appellant’s salon.  She began to drink to excess and use drugs.  She
    became withdrawn and broke off contact with her friends and with D.S. and
    his family, with whom she had become very close.  She did not tell anyone
    what had happened because she felt she “was dirty”.  She testified during
    her examination-in-chief that she was no longer able to have intimate relationships
    with men.  However, when confronted with some hospital records in cross-examination,
    she seemed to concede that she did have a sexual relationship with another
    man after the assault.  She also agreed that she would sometimes return to
    the bar near the appellant’s salon, even though she knew she might run into
    him there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    to four months after the assault, the complainant had a miscarriage at her
    apartment.  She called D.S. and asked him to help her. When he arrived, she
    told him that she had been raped.  It does not seem that she identified the
    appellant as the perpetrator at that time.  D.S. confirmed that he went to
    the complainant’s apartment and saw the result of the miscarriage.  D.S.
    also testified to the complainant’s change in character, although so many
    years later he was unable to pinpoint when the change occurred.  D.S. was
    also unsure of when the complainant stopped working at the appellant’s salon.  In
    cross-examination, he testified that he was pretty sure she was still working
    at the appellant’s salon at the time of the miscarriage.  In re-examination,
    he agreed that he could not say with certainty where she was working at the
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    continued to see the complainant sporadically, and when she was drunk she
    would claim that she had been raped.  When D.S. pressed her for details,
    she always refused.  D.S. testified about the complainant’s drug use as follows.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was the only defence witness.  He testified that within a week
    of hiring the complainant, the two of them began to regularly drink and smoke
    drugs during work hours and afterwards.  Even though the appellant was in
    a long-term relationship with another woman, he frequently went out to bars
    and other places with the complainant.  They became intimate with each other,
    although there was no sexual intercourse.  The appellant testified that he
    enjoyed using marijuana and hashish but was unable to get hashish on his
    own.  The complainant, however, was able to do so and she sold him hashish.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    evening, when his girlfriend was working a night shift, the appellant called
    the complainant and asked if she had anything to smoke.  She said that she
    did and invited him to her apartment.  She gave him the code to get into
    her building, but the appellant had difficulty using it, so the security
    guard called up to the complainant’s apartment and accompanied him up. Once
    in the apartment, the complainant shared her hashish with the appellant and
    they had several drinks.  The appellant said that he wanted to sleep over
    because he did not want to drive home.  The complainant said
    “okay” and lay down on the bed.  The appellant then took his clothes off
    and they engaged in consensual sexual activity leading to intercourse.  They
    went to sleep together.  At about 7:00 a.m. the next morning, the appellant
    woke up and left, saying he would see the complainant at work.  The complainant
    went to work that day and seemed fine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    night, the complainant called the appellant at his girlfriend’s house at
    about 12:30 a.m. and asked if he was coming over.  He told her that he could
    not come over and that she should not telephone him.  He said that he was
    nervous because he wanted to continue the relationship with his girlfriend.  He “started
    to back away”
    from the complainant, although they continued to smoke and drink together.  However,
    the complainant still tried to be near him and cried, saying that she wanted
    to be with him.  The appellant believed she was in love with him.  Some time
    later, the appellant sold the salon and he did not see the complainant again
    for some time.</p>

    appellant testified that two months after he sold his salon, he was working
    in another salon near the complainant’s apartment.  The complainant walked
    by with a man and was smiling, laughing and waving at him. She came into
    the salon a short time later and told the appellant that she was working
    at a nearby restaurant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next time he saw the complainant was several years later at the Coxwell subway
    stop.  The complainant was getting out of a subway car and the appellant
    waved at her and called her name, but he was not sure that she heard him.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    salon when the complainant came in.  She saw him and asked if he was Claudio,
    which was the name the appellant went by.  The appellant said yes and she
    said:  “You raped me. You raped me.”  He replied, “Are you crazy? I am going
    to phone the police.”  She said, “you’re a fat goof.  You’re not worth it.”  Rico
    fired the appellant later that day.</p>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that after the alleged assault, she obtained employment
    at various places including hair salons and restaurants.  Some months after
    the miscarriage, she went to the hospital because she was in considerable
    pain.  The hospital records show this visit was in December 1989.  She was
    diagnosed with endometriosis and fibroids, for which she blamed the appellant
    because of the miscarriage.  In cross-examination, counsel for the appellant
    led evidence that she had told hospital staff that her pregnancy was the
    result of a sexual assault.  She had also agreed with the suggestion that
    she believed the appellant had “ruined [her] insides” and that everything
    that had happened to her subsequent to the assault was the appellant’s fault.</p>

line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    complainant denied seeing and waving at the appellant at the hair salon near
    her apartment. She stated that the next time she saw the appellant was at
    Coxwell subway station, several months after the assault.  She left the train
    and saw him on the platform.  He called her name, but she ran up the stairs
    and met her girlfriends.  They could see she was upset and she told them “what
    happened to me”.  </p>

    complainant testified that the only other time she saw the appellant was
    at Rico’s, approximately ten years later.  She was with her young daughter
    and the child’s grandmother and was going for a job interview.  When she
    saw the appellant, she “was freaked”
    and accused him of raping her.  She then told the child’s grandmother what
    had happened to her.  Rico later called to tell her that he had fired the
    appellant. He offered to give her an interview, and later hired her.</p>

    the trial judge rejected the appellant’s claim that he went to the apartment

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have described above, considerable evidence of the complainant’s conduct
    after the alleged assault, including statements about the assault, was adduced
    at trial.  There was no objection to the admissibility of any of this evidence,
    for a very good reason.  The defence position depended on the sequence of
    events, including the various complaints.  The appellant adduced evidence
    of the complainant’s friendly attitude towards him in the months after the
    encounter.  On the defence theory, all this changed when the complainant
    had to explain the miscarriage to her boyfriend and so she claimed she had
    been raped.  Thereafter, she blamed the appellant for all her medical and
    other problems and her statements were manifestations of her hatred of the
    appellant.  This explained her decision to go to the police and tainted her
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits, however, that the trial judge erred in using the contents
    of these statements for their truth.  The appellant particularly relies on
    the two passages of the trial judge’s reasons quoted above and which I repeat
    here for convenience:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Her spontaneous
    outburst at Rico’s many years later in which she accused [the appellant]
    of being a rapist is consistent with her having been sexually assaulted years
    prior.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Her discovery
    of a dead fetus months later at the time she miscarried and her statement
    to [D.S.] that she had been raped had been confirmed by him in a highly believable
    fashion during his cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown responds to this ground of appeal by arguing that this evidence was
    adduced as part of the narrative and that the trial judge did not misuse
    it.  Rather, the trial judge used the complainant’s conduct, as revealed
    in her statements, as showing consistency with the allegation of assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    admissibility of prior consistent statements under the narrative exception
    to the general exclusionary rule has been discussed in a number of cases,
    usually in the context of admission of prior statements by child complainants
    and often in respect of historical assaults.  See for example:  <i>R. v.
    Ay</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 456 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. B. (D.C.)</i> (1994),
    91 C.C.C. (3d) 357 (Man. C.A.)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); and <i>R. v. B. (O.)</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 531 (N.S.C.A.).  To determine
    whether the trial judge misused the evidence in this case, it is necessary
    to briefly consider the basis for admitting evidence of prior consistent
    statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Hill J. explains in <i>R. v. C. (G.)</i> at para. 44, evidence of prior consistent
    statements by any witness is excluded as a general rule because the evidence
    is irrelevant and lacking in probative value.  The evidence is “self-serving,
    self-corroborative and superfluous”.  Put simply, the fact that a witness
    has on prior occasions said the same thing does not generally make his or
    her testimony any more truthful or reliable.  However, there are exceptions
    to the rule against admission of prior consistent statements because in some
    circumstances, the evidence of prior consistent statements may in fact be
    probative of some issue in the case.  One example is to rebut an allegation
    of recent fabrication.  See <i>R. v. Evans</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 338
    (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    example is what the cases describe as narrative.  The narrative exception
    is, in my view, essentially a convenient label for instances falling outside
    the traditional exceptions where the fact that the witness has made prior
    statements about the incident has some probative value.  Finlayson J.A. considered
    the issue in <i>R. v. F. (J.E.) </i>at p. 472 in the context of the evidence
    of children:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      seems to me that the court should look to narrative as an exception to
      the rule against the admission of previous consistent statements for a
      more hopeful approach to this vexing problem of the evidence of children
      in sexual assault cases. <i>It must be a part of the narrative in the sense
      that it advances the story from offence to prosecution or explains why
      so little was done to terminate the abuse or bring the perpetrator to justice.</i> Specifically,
      it appears to me to be part of the narrative of a complainant's testimony
      when she recounts the assaults, how they came to be terminated, and how
      the matter came to the attention of the police.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    admissibility of prior consistent statements as part of the narrative will
    depend on the circumstances of each case.  In <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i>, Finlayson
    J.A. stressed at p. 474 that the evidence was admissible only if it was necessary,
    for example, “to provide chronological cohesion and eliminate gaps”.  It
    will not always be necessary to know why or how the case came to the attention
    of the police and it will not always be necessary to fill in every gap in
    the chronology to understand the story and properly assess the witness’s
    credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cases make it clear, however, that when prior consistent statements are admitted,
    the contents of those statements are not admissible for their truth.  This
    limitation on the use of the prior statements helps to balance the probative
    value and prejudicial effect of the evidence.  The probative value lies in
    the fact that the statement was made.  The contents of the statement itself
    do not add to the probative value because, as I have said, mere repetition
    of a story on a prior occasion does not generally make the in-court description
    of the events any more credible or reliable.  This limit on the use of prior
    consistent statements has been applied with particular rigour in jury trials,
    where it has been held to be reversible error for a trial judge not to warn
    the jury on the limited use of narrative statements.  See <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i> at
    p. 476, <i>R. v. B. (O.)</i> at p. 542, and <i>R. v. Ay</i> at p. 473.</p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, in a judge alone trial it can generally be assumed that the trial
    judge is aware of the limited use of the evidence.  The question in this
    case is whether the trial judge’s reasons disclose that he misused the evidence.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the two excerpts from the trial judge’s reasons to which objection
    is taken do not disclose error.  While the language used by the trial judge
    could have been clearer, I am satisfied that he was using this evidence to
    show the consistency of the complainant’s conduct.  That consistency, or
    lack thereof, had been placed in issue by the defence.  The appellant attacked
    the complainant’s credibility by attempting to show that she was not acting
    in a manner consistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted.  He
    claimed that she returned to work the following day and that she continued
    to display friendship for him even after leaving his employment.  The complainant
    contested that version of events and her version was confirmed on the two
    occasions referred to by the trial judge.  The incident at Rico’s was confirmed
    by the appellant and the miscarriage events were confirmed by D.S.  In my
    view, the trial judge did not fall into the error of using the contents of
    the complaints as evidence of their truth.</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended several pieces of evidence
    that he used to support the complainant’s credibility.  These were that D.S.
    did not believe that the complainant used drugs, that the complainant never
    returned to work at the appellant’s salon after the assault, and the complainant’s
    description of the appellant’s appearance on the night in question.  I will
    deal with each of these alleged errors in turn.</p>

    evidence about the complainant’s drug use is set out above.  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge misapprehended this evidence because D.S. did
    not say that she did not use drugs, only that she did not use drugs as far
    as he knew.  In my view, the trial judge did not misapprehend this evidence.  D.S.
    was asked whether the complainant used drugs “that [he] knew of”.  His answer, “Not
    that I knew”, was responsive to the question asked.  D.S. had a close relationship
    with the complainant for approximately seven years.  It was open to the trial
    judge to infer that if she had been using drugs during that period, D.S.
    would have known of it.  This would particularly be the case given the picture
    the appellant painted of the complainant as a chronic user and even a trafficker
    of hashish and marijuana. Therefore, the trial judge did not misapprehend
    D.S.’s evidence in supporting the complainant’s credibility.</p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    submission concerning when the complainant returned to work also turns on
    D.S.’s evidence.  As part of his recital of the character changes in the
    complainant, the trial judge mentioned that she did not return to the appellant’s
    salon.  The appellant submits that D.S.’s evidence was that he was “pretty
    sure” she was still working there at the time of the miscarriage.  However,
    as set out above, D.S. in fact significantly qualified his evidence in re-examination,
    where he agreed that he could not say with certainty where she was working
    at the time of the miscarriage.  When all of his evidence is reviewed, it
    becomes clear that D.S. had no real recollection of when the complainant
    worked at various hairdressing salons.  Therefore, I am not satisfied that
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in concluding that the complainant
    did not return to work at the appellant’s salon.</p>

    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the complainant
    testified the appellant “didn’t look okay” on the night in question. The
    appellant argues that in fact, the complainant testified that it was the
    security guard at her building who said the appellant did not “look okay”.
    In my opinion, this does not amount to a misapprehension of the complainant’s
    evidence. The substance of the complainant’s testimony supports the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the appellant did not look okay. The complainant
    also testified that she thought the appellant “was looking strange” and that “something
    was wrong, because the way his eyes were”. Both of these statements were
    also relied on by the trial judge in his description of the complainant’s
    testimony about the appellant’s appearance. Accordingly, I would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge was overly critical of the appellant’s
    testimony while failing to appreciate significant concerns with the complainant’s
    testimony.  These concerns were that D.S. testified that he spent several
    nights at the complainant’s apartment, contrary to the complainant’s evidence;
    that she was inconsistent in her testimony about drug use prior to the assault;
    and that she said she was so traumatized by the assault that she could not
    have a relationship with a man, but later admitted that she had a sexual
    relationship with a man when confronted with hospital records.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these matters do not have the significance the appellant attaches
    to them.  Whether or not D.S. stayed over at the complainant’s apartment
    was not significant. What was significant was his testimony about his conduct
    with her, which confirmed that they had not had intercourse and that she
    did not intend to have intercourse until they were married.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence of drug use was on the whole consistent.  At worst, the complainant
    said she may have used drugs a “[v]ery little[, t]iny” bit before the assault.
    As discussed above, D.S.’s testimony was also consistent with the complainant’s
    evidence that she did not use the drugs prior to the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in my view, the complainant’s evidence about her ability to form relationships
    after the assault was not seriously inconsistent.  The complainant was unable
    to say when she had relationships with men after the assault.  When shown
    the hospital records, she agreed that she had had a sexual relationship with
    a man but she testified that she
    “really wasn’t there”.  This is consistent with her testimony that she could
    not form relationships after the assault. The significance of her change
    in character was that she, in a sense, disappeared; she no longer associated
    with her friends or with D.S. and his family, nor was she able to form new
    relationships.</p>

    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in relying on questionable
    evidence to support the complainant’s credibility.  He particularly relies
    upon the trial judge’s reference to the delay in reporting.  There are many
    reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may not immediately complain and
    no adverse inference should be drawn from the fact of delay alone.  See <i>R.
    v. D. (D.)</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (S.C.C.) at para. 65.  I agree
    with the appellant that the complainant’s delay in complaining to police
    does not bolster her credibility.  However, I am satisfied that the trial
    judge did not use this evidence in that fashion.  His reasons are open to
    the more sensible conclusion that he was simply satisfied with the complainant’s
    explanation for the delay.</p>

line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant points to a passage from the trial judge's reasons which he
    says suggests that the trial judge approached the case as a credibility contest.  The
    impugned part of the reasons is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the face
    of dramatically conflicting evidence of an event witnessed by no one other
    than the two principals, I must make the determination of whether [the complainant]
    consented to the act of sexual intercourse, and, if not, whether [the appellant]
    knew that she did not or was honestly mistaken as to her consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    isolation, this passage might suggest that the trial judge was proceeding
    on the basis of which story he preferred.  However, the passage must be read
    with the balance of the reasons and in particular having regard to the trial
    judge’s express reference to <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d)
    397 (S.C.C.).  After rejecting the appellant’s evidence, the trial judge
    did not simply find him guilty.  He went on to enunciate the method of approaching
    evidence set out in <i>W. (D.)</i>, explicitly noting that even if he rejected
    the appellant’s evidence, he could only convict if the remainder of the evidence
    that he accepted proved the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
    trial judge then explained why he found that the Crown evidence proved the
    appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Sufficiency
      of Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasons were not sufficient and
    did not comply with the standard set in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i> (2002), 162
    C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.).  In my view, the reasons are sufficient.  The trial
    judge expressed in succinct but clear terms why he rejected the appellant’s
    evidence and accepted the complainant’s evidence.  Based on her evidence
    and the evidence of D.S., which was not challenged by the appellant, the
    trial judge was satisfied that the Crown’s case was made out beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  The reasons inform the appellant why he was convicted and permit
    meaningful appellate review.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Fresh Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence a statement made by the complainant
    after the trial.  After the appellant was released on bail pending appeal,
    a victim/witness support worker contacted the complainant to tell her of
    the bail order and the conditions.  The complainant was upset by this news
    and according to the worker, she “expressed great concern for her safety
    and that of her daughter, who [the complainant] said was born as a result
    of the rape in 1988.”  The worker was cross-examined and maintained that
    she was certain about the conversation.  The complainant filed an affidavit
    denying that she said her daughter was born as a result of the rape.  She
    was not cross-examined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the fresh evidence shows that the complainant was
    prepared to lie to get him back in custody.  Further, he points out that
    this lie was not about some peripheral matter, but relates to the very matter
    in issue, namely the sexual assault.  The appellant argues that accordingly,
    the proposed evidence would seriously undermine the complainant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the evidence does not meet the test for admissibility of fresh evidence.
    One of the criteria of that test is that the fresh evidence is such that
    if believed it could, when taken together with the rest of the evidence,
    reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict.  In this case, the fresh
    evidence, if believed, shows the complainant’s continued animosity towards
    the appellant.  But this animosity was palpable at the trial. The complainant
    made it quite clear that she wanted the appellant sent to jail for the rest
    of his life.  It is obvious that the complainant was under a great deal of
    stress at the time she spoke to the worker.  She had just learned of the
    appellant’s release and she had not previously been made aware that the appellant
    was seeking bail.  That she blurted out something of this nature given those
    circumstances would not seriously compromise her credibility.  Accordingly,
    I would reject the application to admit fresh evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of sentencing, the appellant was fifty-one years of age.  He was
    thirty-four years of age at the time of the offence and had no criminal record
    at that time.  Since then, he was convicted of possession of a narcotic,
    refusing to comply with a breath demand and theft under $5,000.  He was in
    a common law relationship at the time of trial.  He had a number of health
    problems including Hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver from excessive
    drinking.  He had been a hairdresser since the age of nineteen but had not
    been working recently due to problems with his knees.  He spent five months
    in pre-trial custody before being released on bail after the preliminary
    inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    detailed in her evidence and repeated in the victim impact statement, the
    offence had a devastating impact on the complainant.  Crown counsel sought
    a sentence in the range of two to four years imprisonment.  The defence sought
    a sentence of one to two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted that the appellant did not express remorse or contrition.  He
    held that a penitentiary term was required because of the need for denunciation
    and general and specific deterrence for “such unlawful and degrading conduct”.  The
    trial judge imposed a sentence of three years and two months after giving
    ten months credit for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the sentence is outside the range and fails to take
    into account the historical nature of the offence, that the appellant had
    not shown himself to be a threat for committing further sexual offences in
    the ensuing years, that the appellant had no prior criminal record at the
    time of the offence, and that he had been a productive member of society.  The
    appellant submits that the trial judge gave no consideration to the objectives
    of rehabilitation and specific deterrence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the sentence was not unfit and the trial judge did not make any
    error in principle.  The length of time between the offence and the trial
    was obvious and was canvassed with counsel during the submissions on sentence.  The
    trial judge specifically referred to the nature of the appellant’s record
    in his reasons for sentence.  In my view, he properly took into account the
    relevant factors.  A sentence of four years imprisonment for an offence of
    this nature was not outside the range.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the submission that the trial judge did not consider rehabilitation and
    specific deterrence, it was open to the trial judge to consider that denunciation
    and general deterrence were the paramount considerations given the nature
    of the offence.  Moreover, the issue of rehabilitation was canvassed by counsel
    during the sentencing submissions and the trial judge referred to specific
    deterrence in his reasons.</p>
