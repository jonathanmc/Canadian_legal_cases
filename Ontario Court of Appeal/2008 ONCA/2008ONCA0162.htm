    appeals the trial judgment.  The appeal raises issues relating to the striking
    of a jury in a civil trial, the legal test for liability in a two-accident
    blended trial, the quantification of damages for future loss of income and
    future maintenance, and the circumstances in which a Sanderson costs order
    is appropriate.</p>
  <h2>B.        <u>FACTS</u></h2>
  <h2>            (1)       <u>The parties and the events</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Benjamin Moore, suffered a broken back in a motorcycle accident
    in 1986.  In another motorcycle accident in 1991, he sustained a serious
    brain injury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 25, 1998, the respondent was involved in a motor vehicle accident
    with a tractor trailer driven by Peter Wienecke.  He sustained soft tissue
    injury to his neck and left knee, a laceration to his left ear, cuts and
    bruises to his left arm, and dislocation of the fourth toe of his left foot.  He
    was treated at St. Michael’s Hospital, which included having his left leg
    placed in a cast, and was released a day later.  On October 5, 1998,
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Moore underwent surgery at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    York
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Central
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital to reduce the toe dislocation.  In January 1999, a second surgery
    was performed to repair cartilage and ligament damage in his left knee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    February 16, 2002, the respondent was involved in a motor vehicle accident
    with a car driven by George Hayik.  Following this accident, the respondent
    complained of increased headaches and soft tissue injuries to his neck and
    upper back.</p>
  <h2>(2)       <u>The trial</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent brought actions against Wienecke and Dunkerron Elevators Inc.,
    the owner of the tractor-trailer involved in the 1998 accident, and Hayik,
    the owner-driver of the car involved in the 2002 accident.  The defendants
    in both actions served jury notices.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    blended trial of the two actions commenced before Mesbur J. on October 31,
    2005.  After hearing 12 days of evidence, the trial judge struck the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 18, 2006, the trial judge released a 53 page (261 paragraph) judgment.
    The trial judge found that Moore was 100 per cent liable for the 1998 accident
    and Hayik was 100 per cent liable for the 2002 accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the second action, the trial judge awarded

    Moore $45,000 for general damages, $349,687 for future loss of income, and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reasons released on May 24, 2006, the trial judge awarded
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore costs of $134,423.69 in the second action.  She also made a Sanderson
    order to the effect that Hayik, the defendant in the second action, pay costs
    of $109,727.81 (awarded against
    <st1:City
w:st="on">

    Moore) to the successful defendants in the first action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant Hayik appeals virtually all aspects of the trial judgment – striking
    the jury, liability, damages for future loss of income and future maintenance,
    and the Sanderson component of the costs order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are other facts relevant to the disposition of the appeal.  In my view, it
    is more helpful to address them in the context of the specific issue or issues
    to which they relate.</p>
  <h2>C.        <u>ISSUES</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant advances four issues on the appeal, which I would frame in terms
    of these questions:</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>future maintenance?</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;'>            (4)       Did the trial

  <h2>D.        <u>ANALYSIS</u></h2>
  <h2>            <u>Preliminary observation</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    blended trial in these proceedings took place over 21 court days between
    October 31 and December 2, 2005.  The trial judge delivered well-organized,
    clearly written and comprehensive reasons for judgment six weeks later, on
    January 18, 2006.  The progress of the trial and the process and contents
    of the judgment are a model of how to conduct a difficult and nuanced civil
    trial.</p>
  <h2>(1)       <u>Striking the jury</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred, near the end of the first
    of the two blended trials and after 12 days of testimony, by striking the
    jury.  The starting point for the appellant’s submission is the proposition
    that a trial by jury in a civil case is a substantive right that should not
    be taken away without just cause or cogent reasons: see <i>King v. Colonial
    Homes Ltd.</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 528.  The appellant submits that this was a
    typical thin skull case well-suited to a jury and that the trial judge was
    provided with a well-known model jury charge from a trial very similar to
    this trial.  Finally, the appellant points out that in her ruling striking
    the jury, the trial judge was particularly complimentary about this jury,
    describing it as “interested, engaged and observant.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    leading case in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario dealing with striking a jury in a civil trial is <i>Cowles v. Balac</i> (2006),
    83 O.R. (3d) 660 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In that case, O’Connor A.C.J.O. discussed the circumstances in which
    an appellate court may overturn a trial judge’s ruling to strike a jury.  In
    my view, an accurate summary of O’Connor A.C.J.O.’s discussion is found at
    paras. 40 and 52:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Appellate review of a trial court’s exercise of
    its discretion to dispense with a jury is limited.  In <i>Kostopoulos v.
    Jesshope</i>, Robins J.A. set out the well accepted standard for appellate
    review as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>I think it manifest from the authorities that
    before an appellate court may properly inter-vene it must be shown that the
    discretion was exercised arbitrarily or capriciously or was based upon a
    wrong or inapplicable principle of law.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>The test is</i> whether there were cogent reasons
    for the exercise of the discretion, <i>King</i>,<i> supra</i>, or, as I would
    word it, <i>was there a reasonable basis for the trial judge’s exercise of
    discretion</i>?  If the circumstances are such that there was no reasonable
    basis for the conclusion reached, then the trial judge will have made a reversible
    error.        [Emphasis added, citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s exercise of her discretion to strike the jury
    was far removed from being arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  The trial
    judge explicitly recognized that the right to a jury trial was an important
    substantive right.  She identified and gave weight to the arguments in favour
    of keeping the jury, including her own favourable impression of the jury’s
    performance during the trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in the end, the trial judge struck the jury for two reasons: first, the complexity
    of dealing with a person (Moore) who had suffered many injuries from five
    motor vehicle accidents (four as a driver and one as a passenger), a fall
    down stairs, a fall off a ladder, a slip and fall accident, and back strain
    from gardening, all over approximately a 20-year period; and, second, the
    fact that Moore had suffered a serious brain injury in a motorcycle accident
    several years before the 1998 and 2002 motor vehicle accidents, which would
    make it very difficult for a jury to assess his credibility, “particularly
    in the context of his reporting of symptoms to his various physicians, but
    against the backdrop of the sequelae of his brain injury as that affects
    his ability to properly report or follow through.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the complexity point, the trial judge summarized her reasoning in this fashion: “Trying
    to come to terms with all these pre-, post-and inter-accident events would
    overwhelm the jury.”  On the implications of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moore’s serious brain injury before the 1998 and 2002 accidents, the trial
    judge relied on the testimony of Dr. Doxey, the vocational psychologist who
    had examined
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore in 1997, before both accidents, and again in 2004, after both accidents.  The
    trial judge said: “Dr. Doxey himself stated that the plaintiff presented
    one of the most complex cases he has ever had to deal with in nearly 30 years
    of clinical practice.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her ruling, the trial judge said that
    “[e]ssentially, each case requires an analysis of the particular facts and
    issues that its particular jury must decide in that particular case.”  In
    my view, the trial judge conducted a careful and proper analysis.  Her decision
    to strike the jury was not the only possibility; it was, however, a reasonable
    decision.</p>
  <h2>(2)       <u>Liability</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge applied the wrong legal test for
    determining causation in a case where there is more than one potential cause
    for the loss.  The appellant submits that the trial judge applied the “material
    contribution” test for causation, a test that was significantly narrowed
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in its recent (admittedly, after the trial
    judgment in this case) decision in <i>Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke</i>, [2007]
    1 S.C.R. 333.  In particular, the appellant relies on McLachlin C.J.’s statement
    of the law at para. 21: “[T]he basic test for causation remains the ‘but
    for’ test.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In my view, although the trial judge did refer to the ‘material
    contribution’ test, her reasons, read as a whole, are consistent with the
    leading cases dealing with causation in negligence cases, including <i>Resurfice
    Corp., supra; Snell v. Farrell</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311; <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>,
    [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458; and <i>Walker Estate v. York Finch General Hospital</i>,
    [2001] 1 S.C.R. 647.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave careful, and separate, attention to the 2002 accident and
    the injuries and losses it caused.  She carefully reviewed the testimony
    of a large number of medical witnesses and made conclusions based on their
    testimony that are consistent with a ‘but for’ analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, on the question of employability, the trial judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although Mr. Moore had been laid off from his job
    at Wirecomm a few weeks before the [2002] accident, the very day of the accident,
    he was on his way to see about the possibility of a new job – even though
    it would likely be in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Milton
    – a far distance from his home.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Moore’s hold on productive employment was tenuous,
    and might, as Dr. Kriry predicted, change if there were further stresses
    in his life.  The 2002 accident created just such a stress.  It is clear
    that, as Dr. Scher testified, supported by Mr. Moore’s family members, this
    was the event that “broke the camel’s back”, and “finished him off” as far
    as his ability to function is concerned.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    on the question of physical injury, pain and psychological effects, the trial
    judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am satisfied that Mr. Moore continues to suffer
    from significant pain in his upper back, and it interferes with his ability
    to function both cognitively and psychologically.  This pain is a direct
    result of the 2002 accident.  While soft tissue injuries like these might
    not generally cause this lingering pain, in Mr. Moore’s case, they have.  Mr.
    Moore was a particularly vulnerable plaintiff because of his pre-existing
    brain injury.  I am also satisfied that as a result, Mr. Moore’s cognitive
    and emotional function have been impaired, and he suffers from more anxiety,
    depression and fatigue than he did before.  This final accident in the long
    history of motor vehicle accidents has been the one to put him over the edge
    into constant pain and virtual unemployability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I am of the view that the trial judge applied the appropriate legal
    principles for determining causation in a multiple accident/multiple injury
    case.</p>
  <h2>(3)       <u>Damages</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant challenges two components of the trial judge’s assessment of damages:
    the $349,687 award for future loss of income and the $31,500 award for future
    maintenance.  The appellant concedes that the test he must meet on this aspect
    of the appeal is to demonstrate that the trial judge made a palpable and
    overriding error in awarding these damages: see <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.</p>
  <h2>(a)       <u>Future loss of income</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding
    error by concluding that the respondent’s residual earning capacity was severely
    diminished as a result of the 1991 accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The trial judge’s conclusion regarding the effect of the 2002
    accident on the respondent’s residual employability was based on ample expert
    evidence, especially from Dr. Scher and Dr. Doxey.  Moreover, the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the respondent’s post-accident employment at Mattamy Homes
    was “benevolent” and, therefore, uncertain was also supported by the evidence.  I
    can find no basis for interfering with her ultimate conclusion that “I would
    put his remaining earning capacity at about 10% of what it was following
    the 1991 accident” and with her calculation of damages for future loss of
    income flowing therefrom.</p>
  <h2>(b)       <u>Future maintenance</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding
    error by awarding the respondent damages of $31,500 for future care and maintenance.  The
    basis for this submission is that the respondent has received assistance <i>gratis</i> from
    family members since his serious motorcycle accident in 1991 and this assistance
    is likely to continue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  I observe that the trial judge’s award in this category was very
    low - $2,000 per year until age 75.  The respondent had sought compensation
    for future maintenance of almost $16,000 per year.  The trial judge was highly
    critical of this component of the respondent’s claim; she said that “the
    claim for future care is excessive in terms of what I believe Mr. Moore can
    actually now do, and what he will need in the future.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the fact that the respondent’s family has helped him with the tasks of daily
    living in the past, and may well continue to do so, is irrelevant.  As expressed
    by Dickson J. in <i>Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2
    S.C.R. 229 at 243, “there is now ample authority for saying that dedicated
    wives or mothers who choose to devote their lives to looking after infirm
    husbands or sons are not expected to do so on a gratuitous basis.”</p>
  <h2>(4)       <u>The Sanderson costs order</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a multiple-defendant case in which the plaintiff succeeds against some defendants
    but not against others, the “normal course” is for the unsuccessful defendant
    to pay the plaintiff’s costs and the plaintiff to pay the successful defendant’s
    costs: see Mark M. Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs</i>, 2d ed., looseleaf (Aurora,
    Ont.: Canada Law Book, 1987) at 2-108.  Sanderson orders – like Bullock orders,
    which are based on the same rationale – are exceptions to that general rule.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her costs reasons, the trial judge accurately explained the rationale for,
    and the contents of, Sanderson and Bullock orders:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Bullock and Sanderson orders are relevant where
    there are multiple defendants, and the plaintiff succeeds against some, but
    not all of them.  The general rule is that the plaintiff is entitled to costs
    against the unsuccessful defendant, and the successful defendant is entitled
    to costs against the plaintiff.  In some circumstances, that can lead to
    an unjust result.  Bullock and Sanderson orders alleviate that injustice.  In
    either case, the unsuccessful defendant is responsible for paying the successful
    defendant’s costs, either directly, or indirectly.  The difference in the
    two types of orders is whether the unsuccessful defendant reimburses the
    plaintiff for the successful defendant’s costs (a Bullock order), or whether
    the unsuccessful defendant pays the successful defendant’s costs directly,
    (a Sanderson order).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then considered whether a Sanderson order was appropriate.  She
    concluded that it was; the core of her reasoning is set out in this passage:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am satisfied that it is fair in all the circumstances
    of this complex case to shift the costs burden to the unsuccessful defendant,
    Mr. Hayik.  The issue of liability in the 1998 accident was by no means a
    foregone conclusion.  As Mr. Neill points out, there was expert evidence
    pointing to the accident having occurred in Mr. Moore’s lane, which would
    have suggested a different liability outcome.  There was also the question
    of Mr. Wienecke’s having had some beer before driving the tractor-trailor.  This
    too made apportionment of liability a live issue.  <i>It was thus reasonable
    to keep the Dunkerron/Wienecke defendants in the action until the conclusion
    of the trial.  Justice in the case as a whole could not have been done without
    both actions being tried together to their conclusion.  It is my view that
    the interests of justice therefore require the unsuccessful defendant to
    be responsible for the successful defendant’s costs</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    recognize that appellate review of a trial judge’s decision to make or not
    make a Sanderson order is subject to the deferential standard associated
    with costs issues in general.  Unless “plainly wrong”, costs awards are not
    to be set aside: see <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</i>, [2004] 1
    S.C.R. 303.  Nevertheless, with respect, in my view, the Sanderson order
    in this case falls into this category of error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    usual test for determining whether a Sanderson order is appropriate has two
    steps: see <i>Times Square Holdings Ltd. v. Shimzu</i>, [2001] B.C.J. No.
    2419 at para. 9 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  First, courts ask a threshold question: whether it was reasonable to
    join the several defendants together in one action.  If the answer to that
    threshold question is Yes, courts must use their discretion to determine
    whether a Sanderson order would be just and fair in the circumstances.  In
    practice, courts deciding whether to issue a Sanderson order do not always
    explicitly follow this two-step procedure.  Sometimes they appear to skip
    a step.  Sometimes they blend the steps together.  This lack of strict adherence
    may be partly due to the fact that courts do not always offer detailed reasons
    regarding costs matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge conflated these two steps.  This is clear from the
    last two sentences in the paragraph from her reasons set out above.  Her
    analysis on the first step, the threshold question, was thorough; however,
    she was almost silent on the second step and did not take into account several
    factors that point strongly against a Sanderson order.</p>
  <h2>(a)       <u>Step 1 - threshold</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was clearly reasonable that the two defendants, Wienecke/Dunkerron and Hayik,
    be tried together.  In saying this, I suggest two things: first,
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore’s independent decisions to sue Wienecke/Dunkerron and Hayik were reasonable;
    and, second, it was reasonable to bring the claims together in a single trial.  The
    following statements by the trial judge, with which I see no reason to disagree,
    support the conclusion that a joint action was reasonable – “The issue of
    liability in the 1998 accident was by no means a foregone conclusion” and “Although
    both accidents were separate events, the question of the extent to which
    either or both contributed to the plaintiff’s injuries creates a sufficient
    factual link between them to support a Bullock or a Sanderson order.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, because of the plausibility of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Moore’s claims against both defendants, as well as the overlapping facts
    relating to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore’s injuries, it was reasonable to join the two claims together.  Accordingly,
    the threshold test for making a Sanderson order was met.</p>
  <h2>(b)       <u>Step 2 – exercise of discretion</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    case law suggests a number of factors that are relevant to the decision whether
    to exercise the court’s discretion and grant a Sanderson order.  These factors
    need not be applied mechanically in every case; after all, the determination
    is discretionary.  Nevertheless, a review of the relevant factors is necessary
    to determine if the trial judge’s exercise of discretion was in error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps
    the foremost consideration is whether the defendants at the trial tried to
    shift responsibility onto each other, as opposed to concentrating on meeting
    the plaintiff’s case.  As expressed somewhat vividly by Eberle J. in <i>Cheskin
    v. Schrage</i>, (1986), 10 O.P.C. (2d) 150 at 154 (H.C.J.): did “each defendant
    [try] to load the lion’s share of the plaintiff’s damages on the other”?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Such
    attempts at shifting did not happen in this blended trial.  Rather, the two
    trials proceeded relatively independently.  Counsel for both defendants spent
    little cross-examination time trying to show that the other of the 1998 and
    2002 accidents was responsible for
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore’s condition.  Rather, most of their efforts were directed at two areas:
    first, establishing that pre-1998 events, especially the 1991 motorcycle
    accident, were the source of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moore’s problem; and, second, undermining the evidence supporting a finding
    that the accident involving their client caused
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore’s injuries.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second factor from the case law is whether the unsuccessful defendant caused
    the successful defendant to be added as a party: see <i>Babcock v. Carr</i> (1981),
    127 D.L.R. (3d) 77 (Ont. H.C.J.) and <i>Eichmanis v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance
    Co.</i> (2007), 278 D.L.R. (4<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>th</span>) 15 at para. 29 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  It is clear in this case that the decision to involve Wienicke/Dunkerron
    was
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore’s decision, not Hayik’s.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    third factor from the case law is whether the two causes of action were independent
    of each other: see <i>Scarborough Golf &amp; Country Club v. Scarborough
    (City)</i> (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 257 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Here, the two causes of action related not to the same incident, but
    rather to accidents that occurred four years apart.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    there is reference in some of the cases to ability to pay: see <i>Cheskin
    v. Schrage, supra</i>, at 154.  In the second action,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore was awarded damages of $426,187 and costs of $134,423.69.  However,
    in the first action, which
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moore lost, the costs award in favour of Dunkerron Elevators Inc. was $109,727.81.  Moreover,
    in her costs endorsement, the trial judge referred to a settlement offer
    (albeit not a Rule 49 offer) by
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore of $125,000 all inclusive with respect to both actions.  It is clear
    from these numbers that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Moore was very successful in the blended trial even though he lost the first
    action completely.  In these circumstances, I see no unfairness in following
    the usual rule of requiring him to pay the costs of the action he lost.</p>
  <h2>E.        <u>DISPOSITION</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal on all issues except the Sanderson costs order.  I
    would allow the appeal on that issue, set aside the Sanderson component of
    the costs order, and substitute an order that the respondent pay the costs
    of Dunkerron Elevators Inc. fixed at $109,727.81 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Success
    on the appeal is divided but, globally, favours the respondent.  I would
    award the respondent costs of the appeal fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements

    Inc.</p>
