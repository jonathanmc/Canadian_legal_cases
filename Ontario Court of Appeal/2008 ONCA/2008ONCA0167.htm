    June 8, 2007, GolfNorth Properties Inc. and two numbered companies purchased
    a golf course from PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. in its capacity as Interim
    Receiver for two bankrupt companies, Heritage Property Holdings Inc. and
    Heritage Properties Development Inc. The sale took place in accordance with
    the terms and conditions of a Sale Approval and Vesting Order issued by Cumming
    J. of the Superior Court of Justice on May 29, 2007. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Vesting Order but prior to the closing of the sale, GolfNorth learned
    that the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation intended to reassess the
    property from farm land to golf course use, and that the reassessment would
    result in a substantial increase in realty taxes (as much as $68,000 per
    year) payable from and after September 2005, when the property began to be
    used commercially as a golf course.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of this information, GolfNorth sought an undertaking from the Receiver
    that the Receiver would pay “all arrears of taxes” to the date of closing
    and a further undertaking that the Receiver would readjust the statement
    of adjustments “if necessary”. The Receiver rejected GolfNorth’s request,
    citing GolfNorth’s acknowledgment in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale that
    there would be “no undertaking to re-adjust given by the Seller on closing” and “no
    holdback from closing proceeds relative to potential readjustment of any
    items on the Statement of Adjustments.” Further communication between the
    parties ensued but this issue was not resolved. The sale closed with the
    Receiver remaining steadfast in its refusal to readjust and GolfNorth maintaining
    that the Vesting Order would protect it from having to pay any additional
    realty taxes arising from the reassessment to the date of closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the closing, GolfNorth and the Receiver moved before Cumming J. for clarification
    of the import and effect of the Vesting Order. In particular, GolfNorth and
    the Receiver wanted to know, as between them, which party would be legally
    responsible for any additional realty taxes that would be owing for the period
    up to June 8, 2007 because of the reassessment. The motion judge resolved
    that issue in favour of the Receiver based on his interpretation of certain
    provisions in the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale and the Vesting Order. In short, he found that the Vesting Order did
    not protect GolfNorth from a “contingent, additional property tax liability
    consequential to a reassessment made subsequent to closing for periods prior
    to closing.”
    Alternatively, if the Vesting Order did provide GolfNorth with such protection,
    the motion judge held that he would have rectified the order in accordance
    with the Receiver’s position having regard to the “contractual intention
    of the parties”.</p>

    appeals from that order and, in its place, seeks an order holding the Receiver
    responsible for any additional realty taxes found to be owing on the reassessment
    for the period up to the date of closing. In support of its position, GolfNorth
    submits that the motion judge misinterpreted the import and effect of the
    Vesting Order and that properly construed, the Vesting Order protected GolfNorth
    from having to pay any additional taxes. GolfNorth also submits that the
    motion judge erred in holding that this was a proper case for rectification. </p>

    submissions are correct and that the motion judge erred as alleged. Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and grant GolfNorth the relief sought. </p>

      way of brief background, prior to March 2007, the golf course property
      was owned by the two Heritage companies. In March 2007, those companies
      were petitioned into bankruptcy by Credit Union Central of Ontario Limited,
      a secured creditor, and PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. was appointed as Interim
      Receiver.</span></p>

      September 1, 2005 to the date of the petition, the former farm property
      was operated by Heritage as a golf course. Nonetheless, the property continued
      to be assessed for municipal tax purposes during that time as farm and
      residential property instead of commercial property. This oversight came
      to the attention of the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton in June 2007 as a result of inquiries initiated by GolfNorth’s general
    counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Shawn Evans. As a result of Mr.&nbsp;Evans’ inquiries,
    Mr. Lawrence Friday, Director of Taxation for the City of Hamilton, made
    his own inquiries and learned that the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation
    had been aware of the change in use of the property from September&nbsp;1,
    2005 and that “the Golf Course Property would be receiving supplementary/omitted
    assessments in August 2007 which would provide for increased assessment value
    of the properties for 2005, 2006 and 2007.”</span></p>

      the meantime, following its appointment in March 2007, the Receiver listed
      the golf course property for sale. On May 9, 2007, the Receiver and GolfNorth
      finalized an Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale under which GolfNorth agreed to purchase the property for $8.1 million.
    Cumming J. issued a Sale Approval and Vesting Order on May&nbsp;29, 2007,
    and the sale was concluded on June 8, 2007. Between those two dates – May
    29 and June 8 –
    GolfNorth raised, for the first time, the issue of the municipal tax reassessment
    and the implications flowing from it. As mentioned, GolfNorth sought an undertaking
    from the Receiver that the Receiver would pay all tax arrears to the date
    of closing and that the Receiver would readjust the statement of adjustments,
    if necessary. The Receiver steadfastly refused GolfNorth’s request. Regardless,
    GolfNorth felt that the Vesting Order would protect it from having to pay
    any additional taxes that would be owing on the reassessment for the period
    up to the date of closing and sought the Receiver’s opinion on the matter.
    The Receiver responded that it could not give “an opinion on the Order and
    what it does or does not protect your client from.” That is how matters stood
    at the time of closing.</span></p>

      31, 2007. Certain aspects of those reasons relate only indirectly to the
      issue at hand, addressing the special lien that the City of Hamilton retains
      over the property for tax arrears by virtue of the <i>Assessment Act</i>,
      R.S.O. 1990, c. A.31, ss. 33 and 34, and the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>,
      S.O. 2001 c. 25, ss. 340, 341 and 349. No issue is taken with the motion
      judge’s analysis of these provisions or with his conclusion that the City
      of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton retains a special lien on the property “in respect of putative outstanding
    property taxes and supplementary or omitted taxes through an as yet inchoate
    reassessment for 2005 to 2007.”  The parties also do not take issue with
    the motion judge’s characterization of the special lien or his determination
    as to the person or persons responsible for the payment of any taxes found
    to be owing on the reassessment.  On those matters, the motion judge observed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The liens arising from taxes payable for the years 2005, 2006 and
      2007 are deemed to be effective on January 1 in each year respectively: <i>Municipal
      Act</i>, s. 307. Once the reassessment process is completed and the additional
      taxes determined, those taxes will be imposed and due to the City with
      a special lien on the subject lands in priority to every claim, privilege,
      lien or encumbrance of every person except the Crown: <i>Municipal Act</i>,
      s. 349(3).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Taxes may be recovered with costs as a debt due to the municipality
      from the taxpayer originally assessed for them and from any subsequent
      owner of the assessed land. If the lien arises prior to the date of sale
      then the purchaser, as a subsequent owner, is liable to the City. If the
      lien arises subsequent to the date of sale then the purchaser is liable
      to the municipality as the taxpayer originally assessed for the property:

      identified the nature of the City’s lien and the person or persons responsible
      to the City for payment of any additional taxes found to be owing for the
      years 2005, 2006 and 2007, the motion judge turned his attention to the
      issue on appeal and identified the provisions he considered to be significant,
      namely, clause 18 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, clause 10 of Schedule “D” to
      the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, and clause 11 of the Vesting Order.
      The motion judge’s analysis of those provisions and his conclusion on this
      issue is found in the following two paragraphs of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, and I so find, paragraph 10 of Schedule “D” supercedes
      paragraph 18 in the Sale Agreement. As such,<i> there is no contractual
      undertaking to readjust for any as yet contingent, additional property
      tax liability consequential to a reassessment made subsequent to closing
      for periods prior to closing</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, paragraph 11 of the Vesting Order is not in conflict with
      Schedule “D”
    paragraph 10 of the Sale Agreement. <i>The Vesting Order does not grant title
    to the purchaser free and clear of the contingent potential tax liability
    to be determined by a reassessment because as of the date of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Sale Order there was no crystallized additional tax liability due to the
    City</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

      determined that the Vesting Order did not afford GolfNorth protection from
      the tax reassessment to the date of closing, the motion judge stated that
      had he found a conflict between “paragraph 11 of the [Vesting] Order and
      paragraph 10 of Schedule ‘D’ of the Sale Agreement”, he would have</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      paragraph 11 of the Vesting Order, and rectifying the Register in respect
      of the subject real property, <i>because of the contractual intention of
      the parties</i>. Such amendment would provide that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      support of his conclusion on the issue of rectification, the motion judge
      referred to the affidavit evidence filed on the motion, in particular,
      GolfNorth’s acknowledgment that it had become “aware immediately prior
      to the closing that the municipal tax reassessment process was underway” and
      GolfNorth’s unsuccessful attempt to have the Receiver agree to “an Undertaking
      to Readjust”. He made further note of the affidavit filed on behalf of
      Heritage in which its principal, Mr. Roland Berger, stated that he had
      advised GolfNorth as early as March or April 2007 that there would be a
      tax reassessment once construction was complete.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
      nothing turns on it, I note that the motion judge made no attempt to resolve
      the apparent conflict between Heritage and GolfNorth as to the date GolfNorth
      initially became aware of the reassessment. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my respectful view, rectification was not available in this case. Regardless
      of when and what GolfNorth may have learned about the reassessment prior
      to closing, the record is clear that at the time of closing, the parties
      had not reached a consensus that GolfNorth would be responsible for any “increased
      realty taxes” found to be owing on the reassessment to the date of closing.
      Rather, the correspondence between GolfNorth and the Receiver in the days
      preceding the closing makes it clear that they were at odds on that issue.
      A fair reading of that correspondence shows that GolfNorth felt it would
      be protected by the Vesting Order, and that the Receiver could offer no
      opinion on the matter. That hardly speaks to a common intention that failed,
      due to inadvertence or mistake, to find its way into the Vesting Order:
      see e.g. <i>Hart v. Boutilier</i> (1916), 56 D.L.R. 620 (S.C.C.); <i>Sylvan
      Lake Golf &amp; Tennis Club Ltd. v. Performance Industries Ltd.</i>, [2002]
      1 S.C.R. 678.  As no such finding was available on this record, rectification
      of the Order was not a possibility.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

      I am respectfully of the view that his finding was unreasonable and not
      supported by the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      fairness to the motion judge, it may be that in granting rectification,
      he considered that the intention of the parties was reflected in clause
      10 of Schedule “D” to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale; but if that is
      so, he failed to reconcile the evidence, outlined in the preceding paragraph,
      which shows that the parties were not <i>ad idem</i> as to which one would
      bear responsibility for any increased realty taxes found to be owing on
      the reassessment to the date of closing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
      equally telling argument against rectification flows from the conundrum
      that would be created if, as the motion judge seems to have found, clause
      10 of Schedule “D” of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale was meant to reflect the intention of the parties. If that were so,
    then clause 11 of the Vesting Order would essentially be rendered nugatory.
    It would be superseded by clause 10 of Schedule “D” and despite its broad
    wording, it would offer no protection to GolfNorth from any claims or encumbrances
    existing at the time of closing that had not, as yet, been asserted. Surely,
    that cannot be so. In my view, much clearer language would be required to
    strip clause 11 of the protection it purported to provide to GolfNorth. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      rectification off the table, the question that remains is whether the motion
      judge was correct in holding that the “Vesting Order does not grant title
      to the purchaser free and clear of the <i>contingent</i> potential tax
      liability to be determined by a reassessment because as of the date of
      the Sale Order there was no crystallized additional tax liability due to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect, I am of the view that the motion judge misconstrued the import
      of the Vesting Order and the nature and extent of the protection it afforded
      to GolfNorth as purchaser. Properly construed, its purpose, evidenced in
      clauses 11 and 12, was to convey the property to GolfNorth free and clear
      of any and all encumbrances or claims, including future claims that existed
      at the time of closing, subject to the specific exceptions identified in
      the Real Property Permitted Encumbrances listed in Schedule “C”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having
      regard to the broad and inclusive language used in clauses 11 and 12, I
      am satisfied that the increased realty taxes at issue fall within those
      provisions. Those taxes are properly characterized as a future claim for
      realty taxes that existed at the time of closing but remained to be quantified.  As
      such, it cannot be said to be “contingent”
    because liability for the increased taxes to the date of closing had crystallized
    prior to the date of closing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      view of that conclusion, I need not finally decide whether clause 11 is
      broad enough to include a contingent claim. However, I do note that clause
      11 does not use the word “contingent” and that it is not a defined term
      in the Vesting Order. The Vesting Order also does not refer to liabilities
      that have
    “crystallized” at the date of closing. Respectfully, the motion judge erred
    by effectively reading in these terms.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      previously indicated, the exception provided in clause 11 for permitted
      encumbrances listed in Schedule “C” does not apply to the taxes at issue.
      It refers to subdivision control by-laws and

    the wording that could have been incorporated into the “Permitted Encumbrances” exception.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      follows, in my view, that the Receiver must bear responsibility for the
      increased realty taxes up to the date of closing, flowing from the reassessment.
      As indicated, those taxes are properly characterized as a future claim
      for taxes that existed at the time of closing. Accordingly, GolfNorth took
