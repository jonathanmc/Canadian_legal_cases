  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Andrea Lazare, appeals from the judgment of Sachs J. following
    an thirteen-day jury trial.  The respondents, Danica Harvey and Brian Bailey,
    were respectively the owner and operator of the motor vehicle that struck
    the appellant, who was a pedestrian.  They admitted liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury assessed the appellant’s non-pecuniary damages at $290,000, loss of
    past income at $30,000, loss of future income at zero and damages under the <i>Family
    Law Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 in the total amount of $43,300.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue on appeal is the jury’s decision to award zero in damages to the
    appellant for loss of future income.  The respondent did not cross-appeal
    the jury’s non-pecuniary damages award and neither party appealed the award
    for loss of past income or for <i>Family Law Act</i> damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not challenge the instructions given by the trial judge, which
    all agree were both thorough and careful.  The appellant only argues that
    the verdict with respect to damages for loss of earning capacity or loss
    of future income is so unreasonable and unjust that no jury, considering
    the evidence as a whole and acting judicially, could have reached it.  The
    respondent argues that the appellant has not discharged the burden of establishing
    an unreasonable verdict because there was evidence that the appellant’s future
    income was not affected by her injury and because the appellant’s expert
    opinion, that may have otherwise supported a loss of future income, was successfully
    challenged on cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I agree with the position advanced by the respondent.  As
    a result, in my view this appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Evidence at trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    brief, the appellant, then twenty-one years of age, was hit by a car during
    the first week of her fourth year of university.  The appellant suffered
    extensive injuries, some of which were significant.  The most significant
    was the injury to the appellant’s lower left leg.  It led to a condition
    called lymphedema, or non-pitting edema, which means that the lymphatic system
    in the appellant’s lower left leg is compromised, causing fluid build-up
    or swelling that causes pain.  The condition is permanent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant’s medical expert, Dr. Tepperman, did not provide testimony
    respecting the degree of the respective risks, he did provide testimony about
    a range<b> </b>of possible complications associated with lymphedema, including
    infection, nerve damage, skin breakdown, elephantitis and even the development
    of tumours.<b>  </b>However, Dr. Tepperman also testified that lymphedema
    can “hopefully be controlled” and most complications avoided with adequate
    care, such as that undertaken by the appellant.  The appellant’s proper care
    of her leg is critical.<b>  </b>The appellant treats her condition by putting
    a Lympha Press on her leg for six to ten hours a night, which forces fluid
    from her lower leg.  At other times, she wears either a Reid Sleeve or a
    pressure gradient stocking to control swelling in her leg.  Once or twice
    a week, the appellant visits a therapist who manually drains fluid from her
    leg. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that lymphedema altered the appellant’s life in many ways.  Swelling
    in her lower leg causes pain, which affects her energy level.  The appellant
    is no longer able to participate in aggressive or competitive sports.  Prolonged
    walking or standing may cause swelling, travelling will require precautions
    including the need for equipment to care for her leg, and a pregnancy will
    carry the risk of thrombosis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant lost a year of studies while recovering from her injuries so that
    her final year of university was delayed by one year.  At the time of trial
    she was employed with Rogers Communications working for the Toronto Blue
    Jays.  The appellant was happy in her employment and pleased to be working
    in the sports industry, in which she had always had an interest.  At the
    time of trial, she had recently received her second promotion.  She earned
    about $28,000 annually, based on her hourly wage of $14.00 and her $3,000
    bonus.  The appellant also testified that she earned further overtime income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s primary argument at trial in support of her claim for a loss
    of future income was that, but for the accident, she would have applied for
    and been accepted at law school.  However, the evidence at trial supported
    a finding that the appellant would not have gained admission to law school.  Accordingly,
    the appellant did not pursue this argument on appeal.  The appellant’s alternative
    argument, and this is the focus on appeal, was that her condition compromised
    her competitive position in the workplace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical
    reports from the appellant’s treating physicians were filed as evidence at
    trial.  The appellant also called Dr. Tepperman, an expert in rehabilitation
    medicine, who based his opinion on a seventy-five minute interview with the
    appellant, a review of the appellant’s written medical records, an admittedly
    limited experience with upper extremity lymphedema in mastectomy patients,
    and his research of medical literature on the topic of lymphedema.  In the
    course of his interview, Dr. Tepperman’s examination of the appellant demonstrated
    normal strength, reflexes and range of motion in her left leg.  However,
    he noted that the appellant experiences numbness, tingling, stiffness and
    a heavy sensation in her lower limb.  He reported:  “If the lymphedema worsens
    as she ages and/or if Ms. Lazare suffers significant complications, she may
    require a more protracted period of absence from work.”  At trial, Dr. Tepperman
    acknowledged that this meant that “if it gets worse she may have to be off
    some more time from work”.  He also told the jury that while the condition
    can be controlled, it often is not.  Even though it was not in his report,
    Dr. Tepperman testified near the end of his examination-in-chief at trial
    that
    “probably within 10 years she will probably not be capable of working”.  Ten
    years from the time of trial, the appellant would be thirty-seven years of
    age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Kumove, the appellant’s vocational assessment expert, based his opinion about
    the appellant’s potential loss of future income on medical reports, including
    information that the appellant had already missed time from work as a result
    of her condition, that her condition was likely to progress and his research
    that, statistically, a person with a disability generally suffers from a
    loss of competitive advantage in his or her career. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the evidence about time missed from work was given by the appellant, who
    testified that pain regularly caused her to leave work early or to miss work
    altogether, the appellant’s concerns about the negative impact of her condition
    on her competitive advantage (which formed the basis of Dr. Tepperman’s opinion)
    had to be weighed in light of the evidence given by the appellant and her
    supervisor, Ms. Spotton.  Both the appellant and Ms. Spotton told the jury
    that the appellant had been promoted on two occasions since she first joined
    the organization a year and a half earlier.  Moreover, Ms. Spotton testified
    that the appellant could expect a further promotion to the position of manager
    within a further eighteen months to two years, if she maintained her current
    level of performance.  This evidence was consistent with the evidence of
    the appellant about her early promotions and belied her claim for loss of
    competitive advantage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a manager, the appellant could earn $50,000 to $70,000, inclusive of commissions
    and bonuses.  After that, the appellant could become a director earning a
    salary, commissions and bonuses of $120,000 and then a vice president, earning
    about $150,000 plus bonuses and commissions.  Ms. Spotton testified that
    the job of director was “for [the appellant] to lose”, and that the appellant
    had been identified as a “top performer” with the Blue Jays.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Spotton also emphasized throughout her testimony that the appellant always
    showed up for work.  Although the appellant is in a job that involves standing
    and even some significant walking, she never complains.  Indeed, Ms. Lazare’s
    job performance is so unaffected by her leg injury that Ms. Spotton observed
    at trial: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She never complains about stuff, so I really, quite
    frankly, didn’t really know anything was wrong with her until I saw her travelling
    with a bag when we flew of on an incentive trip, and in fact I did find out
    that she had been hit by a car or by a truck, and so I understand that, you
    know.  There are some significant problems with her leg, but again, you know,
    she never complains about it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Ms. Spotton testified that the appellant was focussed on her work
    and demonstrated strength of character, a positive attitude, a high willingness
    to learn, a focussed work ethic and would be good at anything she did.  The
    vice president in charge of their division, who also had commented favourably
    about the quality of the appellant’s work, specifically selected the appellant
    for promotion, as the appellant acknowledged in her own testimony.  Finally,
    Ms. Spotton testified that the challenges faced by the appellant because
    of her injury were “not inhibiting her success”. The appellant called no
    evidence from other
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Rogers’ staff to contradict the unqualified evidence of Ms. Spotton.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Submissions and jury charge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of this evidence, in addition to a claim for non-pecuniary damages
    fixed at the upper limit (which was then $315,000), the appellant sought
    $80,000 to $100,000 in loss of past income and $563,850 to $2.8 million in
    loss of future income.  The respondent took the position that non-pecuniary
    damages should be assessed at $100,000, $30,000 for loss of past income and
    zero for loss of future income.  The trial judge suggested a range of $175,000
    to $200,000 for non-pecuniary damages and carefully surveyed the evidence
    regarding the appellant’s loss of income claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her charge regarding loss of future income, the trial judge explained correctly
    and repeatedly that the appellant need only establish that her loss was a
    real and substantial possibility.  She emphasized that the appellant was
    not required to establish this loss on a balance of probabilities, which
    is of course a different and higher standard.  In particular, the trial judge
    gave the following specific instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The onus is not on the plaintiff to prove on the
    balance of probabilities that her future earning capacity will be lost or
    diminished.  The onus is a lower one.  [The appellant] need only satisfy
    you on the evidence that there is a reasonable and substantial risk of loss
    of income in the future to be entitled to damages under this heading.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What you have to decide, then, is whether there
    is a real and substantial risk that [the appellant] will suffer a loss of
    future income, because of the injuries she sustained in the accident.  The
    higher and/or more substantial the risk of [the appellant] suffering such
    a loss, then the higher the award she should receive.  However, in arriving
    at your assessment under this heading you should exclude from your consideration
    any remote, fanciful or speculative possibilities.  I repeat again:  The
    burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy you that there is a real and substantial
    risk that she will suffer a future loss of income by reason of the injuries
    she sustained in the accident.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Put another way, the plaintiff must satisfy you
    that there is a real and substantial possibility that she will suffer such
    a loss. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge canvassed the medical evidence about the extent to which the
    appellant’s condition would affect her income in the future.  She explained
    to the jury that the appellant’s rehabilitation expert, Dr. Tepperman, was
    not one of the appellant’s treating physicians.  She also pointed out that
    the expert had had no contact with the treating physicians, that he was retained
    by the appellant’s lawyer for the purposes of the lawsuit, that he had spent
    a limited time examining the appellant, and that this was the first occasion
    he had given a medical-legal opinion regarding lymphedema.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge reminded the jury that Dr. Tepperman did not give
    the opinion that the appellant would be faced with retirement in ten years
    in his original report.  Rather, at that time, he only opined that the appellant
    would<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>always require sedentary employment, that
    she would lose time from work periodically, particularly if she suffered
    complications, that she may require a more protracted absence from work if
    she suffered more significant complications, and that she could be forced
    into early retirement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge summarized the positions of the parties’ counsel.  The appellant’s
    counsel argued that the appellant would likely have been forced to retire
    at age 37.  As a result, she would lose about $2.5 million if the jury found
    she would have practised law and $2.6 million had she successfully pursued
    her career with the Blue Jays.  The respondents’ lawyer argued that the appellant
    suffered no loss because she would not have gained entry to law school and
    because it was not a real and substantial possibility that she would be forced
    into early retirement by her injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of her instructions on this issue, the trial judge again reminded
    the jury about the lower onus for loss of future income: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Members of the jury, I remind you again that in
    considering the question of whether [the appellant’s] working life will be
    cut short because of her injuries, it is not up to the plaintiffs to satisfy
    you that it is more probable than not that this is so.  Their onus is a lower
    one.  You must be satisfied that there is a real and substantial possibility

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Standard of review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “reasonableness” standard
    of review of a jury verdict was set out in the seminal case of <i>McCannell
    v. McLean, </i>[1937] S.C.R. 341.  In that case, Duff C.J. explained at p.
    343 that, “the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight
    of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy
    the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially
    could have reached it.”  Duff C.J. emphasized that the appellate court’s
    authority to set aside a jury verdict should be exercised with caution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    test, and the principle that the standard for appellate review of a jury
    verdict in a civil case is “very high”, have since been applied in numerous
    decisions of this court.  See for example, <i>Ferenczy v. MCI Medical Clinics </i>(2005),
    198 O.A.C. 254 at para. 5; <i>Kerr v. Loblaws </i>(2007), 224 O.A.C. 56 at
    para. 4; <i>Koukounakis v. Stainrod </i>(1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 299.  Most recently,
    in <i>Bovingdon v. Hergott, </i>2008 ONCA 2, Feldman J.A. noted the high
    standard created by <i>McCannell </i>and commented that, “[c]onsequently,
    it is relatively rare for a jury verdict in a civil case to be overturned
    on appeal.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>McKinley
      v. BC Tel, </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 161 at para. 60, Iacobucci J. noted that
      an appellate court will also set aside a civil jury verdict where “there
      was ‘no evidence’
    supporting a particular verdict”.  Whether under this test or the <i>McCannell </i>test,
    he cautions that an appellate court may not “set aside a verdict on ‘mere
    doubts [it] may entertain’
    or on its ‘reaching on the reading of the evidence a conclusion different
    from that the jury reached’”.  Southin J.A. in <i>Johnson v. Laing </i>(2004),
    242 D.L.R. (4th) 48 at 91 (B.C.C.A.), notes that unreasonable “means lacking
    in reason.”<u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Olmstead
      v. Vancouver-Fraser Park District, </i>[1975] 2 S.C.R. 831, in confirming
      that a jury’s verdict should be treated with considerable respect and accorded
      great weight, De Grandpré J. noted the historical application of the reasonableness
      principle at pp. 837-38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This test of reasonableness has repeatedly been
    stated by our Court. In 1894, in <i>The Saint John Gas Light Company v. Hatfield</i><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>, Gwynne J. said, at p. 169:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>…the well established rule of this Court is,
    that upon such pure matters of fact the court cannot interfere unless it
    be conclusively established that the findings of the jury are so entirely
    wrong, and so unwarranted by the evidence, as to justify the conclusion either
    that the jury did not appreciate their duty or acted wilfully in violation
    of it.</p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center;
'>…<u></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The strength of the rule is evidenced by the judgment
    of Sir Louis Davies C.J., in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I say on this main and controlling issue I
    would as a juryman probably have found against the plaintiff. But that is
    not my province. I have only to determine whether in the conflict of evidence
    we have before us in this case, scientific and practical, we find enough
    to justify reasonable men in reaching the conclusion these jurymen did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Canadian
      Cartridge Company, </i>Davies C.J. further noted at p. 477 that this standard
      was fashioned in part in recognition of the fact that the jury had the
      advantage of “seeing and hearing the witnesses and of judging how far and
      to what extent credit should be given to their statements.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recently,
    in <i>Kerr v. Loblaws</i>,<i> </i>Cronk J.A. dismissed an appeal premised
    in part on the argument that the civil jury verdict was
    “unreasonable”.  In reaching this determination, Cronk J.A. stated at para.
    4: “Finally, because there was evidence to support the jury’s verdict, I
    cannot say that it was unreasonable.”

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the test of reasonableness in the civil context asks whether the jury’s verdict
    is so unwarranted by the evidence as to justify the conclusion that the jury
    did not appreciate and acted in violation of its duty.  In those cases where
    there is some evidence to support the jury’s verdict, high deference will
    be accorded and the verdict will not be set aside even if another conclusion
    is available on the evidence.  I am guided by these principles in assessing
    the jury’s verdict in this case.<i> </i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arguing that the verdict is unreasonable, the appellant relies on <i>M.B.
    v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 477 at para. 47, for the unchallenged
    principle that “an award for loss of earning capacity is intended to compensate
    for the loss of an <u>asset</u>, the capacity to earn.” [Emphasis in original.]  The
    appellant also relies on <i>Brown v. Golaiy </i>(1985), 26 B.C.L.R. (3d)
    353 at para. 8 (S.C.), where the court listed relevant considerations in
    assessing a claim for loss of future income, including the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)         Whether the plaintiff has been rendered
    less capable overall from earning income from all types of employment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)         Whether the plaintiff is less marketable
    or attractive as an employee to potential employers;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)         Whether the plaintiff has lost the ability
    to take advantage of all job opportunities which might otherwise have been
    open to her, had she not been injured; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)         Whether the plaintiff is less valuable
    to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour
    market.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the particular evidence at this trial was capable of supporting the jury’s
    finding that the appellant’s injury - no matter how serious for other aspects
    of her life - did not affect, and had no real and substantial possibility
    of affecting, her level of performance at work and, therefore, did not render
    her less capable, marketable or valuable in the workforce.  While another
    jury may have come to a different verdict, as noted above, that is not the
    standard of review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant simply has not met the high standard required to show
    that no jury could have reached the conclusion that the appellant did not
    face a real and substantial possibility of a loss of future income either
    by reason of a loss of competitive advantage or by reason of forced early
    retirement.  I say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    on the appellant’s own evidence, she had the achieved success in her job.  By
    the time of trial,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Rogers had promoted her twice.  The appellant testified that the next step
    would bring her to the level of a manager earning $50,000 annually, with
    the potential for additional income of $20,000 by way of commission or bonus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    testified that her vice president had specifically selected her for her latest
    promotion.  He was aware of her difficulties with her leg and had enquired
    whether she could handle a new position, which required longer days, more
    intense hours, and occasional seven-day work weeks.  The appellant told her
    vice president that she was prepared to try it and in fact continued in her
    new position at the time of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Ms. Spotton, who was the appellant’s own witness, testified that the appellant
    did not complain about her leg, even though her job involves standing and
    walking.  She performed her employment without complaint or apparent difficulty
    and had very positive prospects for ongoing promotion.  The appellant called
    no evidence from other
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Rogers’ staff to contradict the unqualified evidence of Ms. Spotton.  The
    evidence clearly supported a conclusion that the appellant suffered no loss
    of competitive advantage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant’s treating physicians did not testify.  Medical reports were
    filed at trial regarding the impact of the appellant’s condition.  Dr. Nasser,
    a general and vascular surgeon who saw the appellant on only one occasion,
    reported that the appellant’s lymphedema would progressively worsen “depending
    on her choice of profession, number of her pregnancies, and whether she gets
    infection or injury to the left lower extremity.”  Dr. Nasser indicated that
    the appellant would have to take precautions while travelling, elevate her
    legs on a daily basis, wear support stockings, avoid injury or infection,
    and remain active using her calf muscles to pump the fluid in her legs.  He
    stressed the importance of regular walking exercises.  Dr. Nasser opined
    that the appellant’s condition would be “a factor if she wants to do aggressive
    or competitive sports and it will definitely change her options with the
    kind of activities/sports and their respective intensity<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>”</span>.    This report contains nothing to support
    Dr. Tepperman’s opinion about the appellant’s ability to earn future income.  Furthermore,
    Dr. Nasser’s report was from 2002.  No updated report was filed at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Ogilvie-Harris, an orthopaedic surgeon provided reports.  According to his
    July 2003 report, the appellant complained of ongoing pain and tingling in
    her left leg and ankle.  At the time, the appellant was working for Parks
    and Recreation doing physical work on the grass crew.  The appellant reported
    that tennis aggravated her symptoms, but she was able to go to the gym five
    days a week.  Dr. Ogilvie-Harris noted that the appellant had to protect
    her leg.  He recommended sedentary employment in the future and, apparently
    for this reason, gave his opinion that the appellant’s competitiveness in
    the labour market would be limited in the long term.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Ogilvie-Harris again reported in March 2004.  At that time, he noted that
    the appellant
    “was working in an office in a sedentary capacity” and that “she is able
    to carry out this job”.  While Dr. Ogilvie-Harris observed that recent swelling
    in the appellant’s leg required treatment, he only spoke about the condition
    as limiting the appellant’s physical activities and heavy housework responsibilities.  As
    far as her employment was concerned, he only repeated his comment that she
    will need sedentary or light work.  In addition, he observed that if she
    became pregnant she might have more swelling and “may require time off work
    to try and control” that swelling.  He made no further mention of possible
    loss of competitive advantage or forced early retirement.  Although there
    is a reference to a November 2004 report, this was not included in the appeal
    book and I assume that it contained no contrary information.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pilowsky, a psychologist, provided reports in February and August 2002.  He
    noted that the appellant suffered psychologically from the accident and her
    subsequent inability to return to school the next year.  Dr. Pilowsky expressed
    no opinion relevant to the appellant’s future abilities in the workplace
    relating to her lymphedema.  The emphasis of his report appeared to be on
    the appellant’s ability to do well on her return to university because he
    was concerned about cognitive impairment but, by the time of trial, the appellant
    had in fact successfully completed her university degree and obtained employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    these medical reports, all of which were dated, and which the jury had with
    it during deliberations, provided little foundation for Dr. Tepperman’s opinion
    about the appellant’s future employment prospects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Tepperman’s opinion was also substantially challenged on cross-examination.  Dr.
    Tepperman, a physiatrist and rehabilitation expert, acknowledged that he
    had only limited exposure to lower-limb lymphedema and lymphedema acquired
    as a result of trauma.  Much of his knowledge about the appellant’s prognosis
    was based on his review of medical literature.  He acknowledged that he was
    retained by the appellant for litigation purposes only and did not contact
    her treating doctors nor offer any treatment for the appellant.  He also
    acknowledged that he only saw the appellant on one occasion when he confirmed
    the appellant’s numbness and tingling, but also reported normal strength,
    reflexes, pulse and range of motion in her leg.  He recorded the appellant’s
    report of increased swelling in 2004 and gave his opinion that swelling could
    lead to nerve compression, increased pain and resulting fatigue.  He expressed
    concern about an increased risk of thrombosis during pregnancy.  Dr. Tepperman
    did not give an opinion about the incidence of the possible complications
    of lymphedema, except to say regarding lymphangiosarcoma that he had little
    experience with such disorders personally.  Most importantly, in his report,
    Dr. Tepperman noted that “the lymphedema does not represent a contraindication
    to sedentary, to light work that does not necessitate prolonged standing
    or walking”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as I noted earlier, although Dr. Tepperman testified that the appellant could
    work in sedentary employment, he also testified that she probably would not
    be able to work in ten years time.  The respondent did not object to the
    admissibility of this substantive change in Dr. Tepperman’s opinion.  When
    asked why he said nothing about a ten-year restriction on employment in his
    written report, Dr. Tepperman said that he could not provide an answer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly
    Dr. Tepperman’s opinion and his limited degree of expertise in the area of
    lymphedema could reasonably have been seen by the jury to have been substantially
    undermined at trial.  In this circumstance, it cannot be said that the jury
    acted unreasonably in rejecting his spontaneous opinion about early retirement
    for the appellant, and in accepting his written opinion that the appellant
    could perform sedentary work.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the jury did not act unreasonably in rejecting the evidence of Dr. Kumove.  Trials
    are not about general statistics but about the particular litigant.  Dr.
    Kumove’s statistics about disabled employees did not apply to Ms. Lazare’s
    very successful employment and employment prospects, particularly when considered
    in the context of her clear intelligence, enthusiasm and considerable abilities,
    including her obvious success in performing her relatively sedentary employment
    with Rogers unaffected by her leg injury.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Result</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant has failed to establish that the verdict is unreasonable
    and unjust.  Since there was ample evidence to support the jury’s verdict
    regarding loss of future income, it is anything but unreasonable or unjust.  Even
    if a different trier of fact may have awarded Ms. Lazare some damages for
    future loss of income, it cannot be said that no trier of fact would have
    done so on the basis of the evidence presented at trial.  The jury in this
    case was provided with careful and proper instructions on how to arrive at
    its verdict.  There is nothing in the evidence or in the verdict that suggests
    that the jury failed to comply with these instructions, appreciate its duty
    or act wilfully.  The jury’s careful assessment of its verdict is reflected
    in the high award for non-pecuniary damages, an award that amply and generously
    compensated the appellant for the long term effects of her injuries and their
    impact on her personal, athletic, social and sexual life.  The jury also
    was also clearly alive to the issue of loss of income because it awarded
    Ms. Lazare damages for her year at university following the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    in my view, the appellant is not entitled to a new trial for the purpose
    of calling evidence that she did not call at the first trial.  Absent good
    reason, litigants are not entitled to two kicks at the can. The appeal must
    be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find some support for this conclusion in the decision of the experienced
    trial judge who determined on a Rule 52.08(1) motion that the jury’s verdicts
    were not conflicting.  While I recognize the distinction described in the
    reasons of Laskin J.A. between conflicting verdicts under Rule 52.08(1)(c)
    and unreasonable verdicts, I am also cognizant that, as in <i>Burlie v. Chesson </i>(2001),
    146 O.A.C. 106, there is much “overlap” between the arguments made on that
    motion and on this appeal.  Clearly, there was much overlap in this case
    because the appellant argued before the trial judge that it was inconsistent
    for the jury to award non-pecuniary damages in an amount approaching the
    maximum allowable under Canadian law, on the one hand, and to deny the appellant
    any award for future loss of income, on the other hand.  The trial judge
    rejected this submission and dismissed the motion.  Although unfortunately
    the trial judge’s reasons for her dismissal could not be located despite
    the diligent efforts of all, the jury in this case was in the best position
    to make findings of fact and the trial judge was in the best position to
    assess the verdict.  In my view, the trial judge’s assessment on the motion
    would have incorporated a consideration of its reasonableness in light of
    the jury’s findings regarding the other heads of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    while I disagree with Laskin J.A. that this verdict is unreasonable, in my
    view the only available remedy in the face of an unreasonable verdict would
    be a new trial.  In this case, the jury’s verdict was clearly based on its
    rejection of the appellant’s expert evidence and its acceptance of the evidence
    about the appellant’s promising career.  Since credibility was the central
    issue, in my view it is not open to this court to substitute its own opinion
    about the appellant’s loss of future income.  Furthermore, since the appellant
    sought $563,850 to $2.8 million in loss of future income at trial and the
    respondent sought an award of zero, it is not reasonable for this court to
    arrive at an appropriate figure.  It would not be “just” within the meaning
    of s. 119 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, to substitute our own assessment
    of credibility and damages.  Indeed, it would be unjust.  Thus, if I had
    been persuaded that the verdict for future loss of income was unreasonable,
    I would have ordered a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding, and on behalf of the panel, it is appropriate to express our
    admiration for the positive attitude and approach demonstrated by the appellant
    in the face of her adversity.  As well, we thank both counsel for their very
    able presentations of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel

    Ms. Lazare $290,000 in general damages, more than the range of $175,000 to
    $250,000 recommended by the trial judge, and only $25,000 less than the $315,000
    maximum allowable under Canadian law.  The respondents have accepted this
    award.  They have paid the money to Ms. Lazare.  By its very high award,
    the jury obviously accepted the gravity of Ms. Lazare’s injuries and the
    extent of her pain and suffering.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet,
    unfathomably, the jury awarded Ms. Lazare nothing for her future loss of
    income.  Perhaps it was unduly influenced by Ms. Lazare’s own courage, determination,
    and refusal to complain in the face of her adversity; despite her lymphedema,
    she got a job with Rogers Communications working for the Toronto Blue Jays,
    was singled out as a top performer, was quickly promoted into the corporate
    sales department, and, at the time of trial, was earning around $25,000.  Or,
    perhaps the jury was influenced by the testimony of Ms. Lazare’s supervisor,
    who after supervising her for but three months claimed she was targeted to
    be a manager and could succeed in anything she undertook.  If the jury was
    so influenced, then its appraisal of Ms. Lazare’s future was idealistic,
    but hardly realistic or reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the expert evidence, all called by Ms. Lazare, and her own evidence, give
    a very different appraisal.  Lymphedema means that a person’s lymphatic system
    has been compromised.  In Ms. Lazare’s case, fluids that would normally be
    processed through the body accumulate in her left leg causing intense pain
    and swelling.  The pain and swelling severely limits her ability to walk,
    stand, or even sit for extended periods.  It saps her energy.  She often
    cannot work a full day.  She certainly cannot put in the extended hours ordinarily
    required for higher paying positions.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    as the years pass, Ms. Lazare’s lymphedema will only get worse.  By the time
    of trial, despite extensive medical treatments, her condition had already
    deteriorated.  This has happened even though she tries to control the swelling
    by immobilizing her leg in a “lymph press” for at least six hours every night,
    by wearing a “Reid sleeve” or compression stockings during the day, and by
    taking weekly treatments to drain the fluids from her leg.  None of this
    evidence was contradicted.  In the face of the compelling evidence supporting
    Ms. Lazare’s claim, an award of zero for future income loss was both unjust
    and unreasonable.  </p>

    standard of appellate review of a civil jury verdict is well established.  Where,
    as in this case, the trial judge’s charge is fair and accurate, the jury’s
    verdict will be set aside only where it is “so plainly unreasonable and unjust
    as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
    acting judicially could have reached it”: see <i>McCannell v. McLean</i>,
    [1937] S.C.R. 341 at 343.  Although this standard means that appellate courts
    should treat jury verdicts deferentially, it does not mean that they should
    treat them “with awe”: see <i>Olmstead v. Vancouver Fraser Park District</i>,
    [1975] 2 S.C.R. 831 at 839.  Juries are not infallible.  They make mistakes.  When
    they do, an appellate court should not hesitate to intervene.</p>

    Lazare contends that the jury’s award for future income loss is unreasonable
    and requires appellate intervention.  The respondents and my colleague contend
    that the jury’s award of zero is reasonable for three reasons: (1) they say
    there was evidence at trial, principally that of Ms. Spotton (Ms. Lazare’s
    supervisor) and Ms.&nbsp;Lazare herself, showing that she would not suffer
    a loss of earning capacity because of her injury; (2) they say the medical
    and other evidence does not support Ms. Lazare’s claim; and (3) they say
    the trial judge’s ruling at the end of the trial – dismissing the appellants’ motion
    under rule 52.08(1)(c) for an order that the jury’s awards were “conflicting” –
    supports the verdict.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept any of these three contentions. First, neither Ms. Spotton’s
    optimistic opinion about what Ms. Lazare can accomplish nor Ms. Lazare’s
    own evidence about the professional success she has achieved so far lend
    any credible support to the respondents’ claim that her income will not be
    compromised in the future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    contrary to the position taken by my colleague and the respondents, in my
    view the medical evidence – which as I have said was entirely uncontradicted – overwhelmingly
    supports Ms. Lazare’s future loss of income claim. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    third, the trial judge’s ruling that the jury awards were not conflicting
    does not answer the question we must answer: whether the award of zero for
    future income loss was unjust and unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    reasons that I will elaborate on, in my opinion the jury’s award was unreasonable
    and should not stand. In discussing why I say this is so, I will also address
    the arguments put forward by my colleague and the respondents.</p>
  <h3>(2)       The jury’s award of zero for future income loss was unjust and
    unreasonable</h3>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    establish her claim for loss of future income, Ms. Lazare did not need to
    make out her case on a balance of probabilities.  Instead, she merely had
    to show a real and substantial possibility that she would suffer a loss of
    income in the future because of her injury: see <i>Schrump v. Koot</i> (1997),
    18 O.R. (2d) 337 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Graham v. Rourke</i> (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 622 (

  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Typically,
    an award for future loss of income is intended to compensate for the loss
    of earning capacity – in other words, to compensate for the loss of an asset,
    the capacity to earn: see <i>M.B. v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R.
    477 at para. 47.  The trial judge so instructed the jury.  In her words,
    “[w]hat you are required to do is arrive at a lump sum figure that will fairly
    and reasonably compensate Andrea for her future loss of earning capacity.  It
    is up to you to assess that amount on the basis of the evidence.”  What then
    did the evidence show?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents and my colleague Lang J.A. point to the evidence of Ms. Spotton,
    Ms. Lazare’s supervisor, to support the verdict.  Ms. Spotton was obviously
    a huge fan of Ms. Lazare’s.  She testified that Ms. Lazare could succeed
    in anything she wanted to do and that she had exceeded the organization’s
    expectations.  In Ms. Spotton’s view, if Ms. Lazare maintained her current
    level of performance she would be promoted to a manager.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Spotton’s testimony does provide some support for the conclusion that Ms.
    Lazare will not suffer a future income loss because of her injury.  However,
    to draw that conclusion from her evidence is neither fair nor reasonable.  It
    is not so because of the significant limitations of her testimony and because
    of the overwhelming evidence against that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Ms. Spotton gave her rosy opinion of Ms. Lazare’s future, she had supervised
    her for only three months.  Ms. Lazare was one of thirty to thirty-five people
    Ms. Spotton was supervising.  Moreover, unlike Ms. Lazare’s previous supervisor,
    Ms. Spotton was unaware that Ms. Lazare frequently left work early for medical
    appointments or because she could not tolerate the pain.  She was not even
    aware of Ms. Lazare’s lymphedema until they went on a business trip together.  And
    her opinion that Ms. Lazare would “be good” at anything she undertook, including
    obtaining a managerial position with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Rogers, was qualified by a major caveat: that Ms. Lazare could maintain her
    current level of performance indefinitely.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    all the evidence called at trial demonstrated that despite Ms. Lazare’s determination,
    perseverance, and best efforts, she will not be able to maintain her high
    performance as her condition progressively deteriorates.  This evidence comes
    from three sources: the medical experts, Ms. Lazare herself, and a vocational
    assessment and rehabilitation expert.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury heard expert medical testimony from Dr. Tepperman (a specialist in physical
    medicine and rehabilitation) and received written medical reports from several
    others including Dr. Pilowski (a psychologist), Dr. Ogilvie-Harris (an orthopaedic
    surgeon), Dr. Nasser (a general and vascular surgeon), and Dr. Richards (a
    plastic surgeon).  Their evidence showed the following.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    Ms. Lazare’s lymphedema and other injuries amount to a serious physical impairment.  For
    the rest of her life she will have a limited ability to kneel, squat, run,
    jump, and go up or down stairs.  If she walks or even stands for extended
    periods she will frequently have to rest to elevate her leg.  And she will
    always have to endure pain in her leg.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    lymphedema is degenerative and will almost surely get worse.  The degeneration
    will become more pronounced if she has a job that requires a lot of walking
    or standing, if she gets pregnant, or even if she gets a minor skin infection
    from a mosquito bite on her leg.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    because of her physical limitations, Ms. Lazare will require sedentary or,
    at least less demanding employment that allows her to be seated much of the
    time.  Overall, the tenor of the medical evidence is that although up to
    the time of trial Ms. Lazare had coped reasonably well with her condition,
    she faces a difficult road ahead. Simply put, she will not be able to take
    on a job that is physically demanding, or that demands long hours of work,
    or that requires prolonged standing or walking, or that needs a high level
    of energy.  Instead, for the rest of her life she will be restricted to “light” employment
    and to compensation commensurate with that kind of employment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lang
    J.A. does not think that the medical evidence supports Ms. Lazare’s claim
    for two reasons. First, she says that Dr.&nbsp;Tepperman knew little about
    Ms. Lazare and her condition, and in any case, counsel for the respondents’ cross-examination
    of him undermined his opinion. Second, she says that the other medical evidence
    offers only a
    “limited foundation” for Dr. Tepperman’s opinion about Ms. Lazare’s future
    employment prospects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree with my colleague’s view of the medical evidence. The trial
    judge ruled that Dr.&nbsp;Tepperman could give expert opinion evidence on
    lymphedema, on Ms. Lazare’s prognosis, and on how her condition might affect
    her future employment. Although Dr. Tepperman agreed that he has not had “a
    great deal of exposure” to lymphedema, this is because the condition itself
    is very rare.  The trial judge found that he had enough experience to be
    considered an expert in the field.  The respondents do not challenge that
    finding in this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    might be expected from a careful practitioner, before giving his opinion,
    Dr. Tepperman reviewed the other medical reports on Ms. Lazare, met with
    her, and took her medical history.  In his evidence Dr. Tepperman discussed
    in detail the many day to day problems and possible complications associated
    with lymphedema. He emphasized that the condition is permanent, and “not
    reversible by any means”. And while he held out the hope that it might be
    controlled with stockings and “pneumatic pressure devices”, he said the condition “often
    is not well controlled, and it usually tends to progress with time, and it
    is a very serious disorder”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Tepperman then turned to the effect of Ms. Lazare’s condition on her ability
    to work in the future. He made two points. First, Ms. Lazare’s condition
    will limit the kind of jobs she can take:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Part
    of your expertise, Doctor, is to estimate how this might affect somebody’s
    employment, their ability to maintain employment and continue working.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Can you help us in this case of how this might affect
    Andrea Lazare’s employment?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I’ll
    try. Basically, because of the condition itself, the swelling, she wouldn’t
    be able to manage any kind of job that requires any length of time standing
    or walking or certainly climbing, running, jumping, things of that sort.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All right. So it would have to be a sedentary job
    where she is off her feet most of the time.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That would help reduce the swelling or keep the
    swelling from increasing to a certain degree, but there is another issue,
    and that’s the issue of pain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    because her condition is progressive, Ms. Lazare will have difficulty maintaining
    employment and likely will not be able to work more than ten years:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        In spite of the fact that the swelling
    alone would not prevent her from managing a sedentary job, the degree of
    pain resulting from the condition, the secondary effect on the nerves, could
    become disabling because of the problems with concentration, with emotional
    responses to pain, and could lead to difficulty maintaining employment, even
    with the swelling itself not being the cause directly.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    how long – if the condition is a progressive one, and we have heard from
    a vascular surgeon that it is a progressive condition, what might she be
    facing in terms of her employment for the future?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Well,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Right.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    I would estimate probably within 10 years she will probably not be capable
    of working, and much of this may depend not just on the degree of swelling,
    but also on her ability to tolerate consistently being in pain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    J.A. says that on cross-examination Dr. Tepperman’s opinion was “substantially
    challenged”. She points out that in his report Dr. Tepperman did not say
    Ms. Lazare would only be able to work another ten years. She says that he
    could provide no answer for this omission. But he did provide an explanation.
    He was not avoiding the question but was only asked to answer it at trial.  More
    important, this omission does not affect Dr. Tepperman’s overall opinion:
    Ms. Lazare’s condition will worsen and the worsening of her condition will
    adversely affect her ability to work in the future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    other medical evidence was consistent with Dr. Tepperman’s opinion.  For
    example, Dr. Nasser said that Ms. Lazare’s lymphodema is a “condition that
    will slowly but progressively get worse”.  Dr. Ogilvie-Harris said that Ms.
    Lazare’s injuries represent a “permanent and serious impairment of important
    bodily functions … [and] limit her competitiveness in the labour market on
    a long-term basis.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    colleague and I differ on the strength of the medical evidence.  In my view,
    all of it points in one direction – that Ms. Lazare’s condition is permanent,
    that it is serious, and that it will get worse.  None of it suggests that
    Ms. Lazare’s future employment will be unaffected by her progressive and
    disabling condition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    Lazare’s testimony about her present condition gives credence to the medical
    evidence.  She already has difficulty with her energy level.  At times, she
    is anxious, irritable, forgetful, and unable to concentrate.  When she sits
    at a desk, her left leg must be elevated.  She is in constant pain.  She
    often has to leave work early or call in sick because the pain and swelling
    in her leg are not tolerable.  She not only has to wear a “Reid sleeve” or
    compression stockings during the day and use the “lymph press” at night,
    she must go to a therapist once a week to have the fluids manually drained
    from her leg. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully,
    Lang J.A. does not adequately take into account that Ms. Lazare’s lymphodema
    is degenerative, and that her current condition will worsen over time.  Instead,
    she seeks to support the jury’s failure to award Ms. Lazare any future income
    loss by pointing to the success Ms. Lazare has already achieved at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Rogers. However, Ms. Lazare’s present or past professional achievements are
    not the focus of this appeal. The focus must surely be on the future, and
    that future almost certainly will not bring the same measure of success Ms.
    Lazare would have achieved without her injury.</p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For,
    as I have said, with the passage of time, Ms. Lazare’s current condition
    will only deteriorate. Yet as she tries to move up the corporate hierarchy
    at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Rogers or elsewhere, any job she might apply for will inevitably be more
    demanding, call for longer hours, more energy, more walking, and more standing.  Common
    sense tells us as much.  Without her lymphedema, Ms. Lazare’s intelligence,
    enthusiasm, dedication, and the high energy she exhibited before the accident
    would undoubtedly have made her an ideal candidate for a senior management
    position.  Sadly, her lymphedema has seriously compromised her competitive
    marketability in the workplace.  To now say there is no real and substantial
    possibility she will suffer a loss of income in the future defies reason.  </p>

    evidence of Mr. Kumove, an expert in vocational assessment and rehabilitation,
    also supports my opinion.  He testified that the disabled – and Ms. Lazare
    is functionally disabled – face a competitive disadvantage in the workplace.  Statistics
    show that disabled persons earn significantly less money than non-disabled
    persons, receive fewer salary increases, are less often employed full-time,
    and are less likely to be promoted.  </p>

    J.A. says that Mr. Kumove’s evidence has little weight because “trials are
    not about general statistics but about the particular litigant.”  Yet, in
    addition to the obvious points that Mr. Kumove’s statistics were uncontradicted
    and that statistics can assist a trier of fact to evaluate a “particular
    litigant”, Mr. Kumove also gave expert opinion evidence about Ms.&nbsp;Lazare
    specifically.  Mr. Kumove recognized that she was having some success in
    the workforce but is still struggling:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Well, when I look at Andrea’s situation
    now, I see a person who has a significant disability who is making a good
    effort to stay employed and is having a reasonable degree of success. Actually,
    relative to the seriousness of her problems she is doing quite well, but
    she is struggling. She is struggling in terms of concentration. She is struggling
    in terms of pain. She is struggling in terms of her ability to maintain attendance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Kumove also gave expert opinion evidence about Ms. Lazare and her future
    employment prospects. He said, “she faces some very formidable barriers to
    advancing to higher levels of management.”  He elaborated on the inevitable
    competitive disadvantage she will face in the following words:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Because of the limitations she faces due
    to the disability, I mean, even at this point, Andrea leaves early, sometimes
    has to call in sick from work, has to moderate her hours in terms of she
    has to work as many hours she can. She doesn’t work a regular number of hours
    during the week, and as you rise to higher managerial levels in the business
    the expectation for you being there all the time gets more and more important
    and I don’t see how Andrea could be expected to just always be there for
    as long as it takes to get the job finished as a manager, as a director,
    as a vice president. It is a sales position. The most important person is
    the customer or the client. Corporate sales, that involves long meetings,
    involves socializing with the client.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think that at every step along the way the fact
    that Andrea she can’t sit for as long, she can’t stand for as long, she faces
    problems, although I’m sure she tries her best, she faces problems with concentration,
    that I believe that that will definitely hold her back in how far she will
    go, how many hours she will work, and could very well affect her sustainability
    on a long-term basis in a job.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Kumove concluded that if Ms. Lazare’s condition got any worse, “I think that
    very quickly she will reach the point where she is no longer able to stay
    in the competitive labour market.”  As I have already said, Dr. Ogilvie-Harris
    gave the same opinion.  And, of course, all the medical evidence overwhelmingly
    suggests that her condition will worsen.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence of the experts and Ms. Lazare lead to but one conclusion: there
    is a real and substantial possibility that Ms. Lazare will suffer a future
    income loss.  No other reasonable and just conclusion is available on this
    record.  I would therefore set aside the jury’s award of zero for future
    income loss.</p>
  <h3>(3)       The trial judge’s ruling under rule 52.08(1)(c) does not preclude
    this court from reassessing Ms. Lazare’s</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the jury gave its verdict, Ms. Lazare’s counsel brought a motion before the
    trial judge under rule 52.08(1)(c) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> contending
    that the jury’s award of general damages and future loss of income were conflicting.  Rule
    52.08(1)(c) states: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) Where the jury,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)       answers some but not all of the questions
    directed to it or <i>gives conflicting answers, so that judgment cannot be
    granted on its findings,</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>the trial judge may direct that the action be retried
    with another jury at the same or any subsequent sitting, but where there
    is no evidence on which a judgment for the plaintiff could be based or where
    for any other reason the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, the judge
    shall dismiss the action. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reserved briefly on the motion and then dismissed it.  The respondents
    rely on the trial judge’s ruling in support of their argument that Ms. Lazare’s
    appeal be dismissed.  Lang J.A., too, relies on it.  In my view, for two
    separate reasons, the trial judge’s ruling provides no support for a dismissal
    of this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge’s endorsement containing the reasons for her ruling has been
    lost and, despite everyone’s diligent efforts, has not been found.  We cannot
    review the basis for the ruling without the reasons for it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and more important, the appellate standard of review of a civil jury verdict
    differs from the standard applied by a trial judge under rule 52.08(1)(c).  Although
    in some cases the two may overlap, review on a standard of
    “unjust and unreasonable” is broader than review for “conflicting answers”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    difference finds support not only in the plain meaning of the different words
    used, but in recent case law from this court.  Two cases in particular show
    the difference: the decision of Osborne A.C.J.O. in <i>Lang v. McKenna</i> (2000),
    135 O.A.C. 304 and the decision of Charron J.A. in <i>Burlie v. Chesson</i> (2001),
    146 O.A.C. 106.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Lang</i>,
    at para. 24, Osborne A.C.J.O. emphasised that even if there was some evidence
    to support the jury’s answers and those answers were not “conflicting”, only
    an appellate court can decide whether a jury’s answer was reasonable:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If there is some evidence to support the jury’s
    verdict (as distinct from no evidence), it is still open to the unsuccessful
    party to contend on appeal that the jury’s verdict was not supported by the
    evidence.  However, as I have said, the unreasonable or perverse verdict
    issue is an appellate court issue, not an issue to be dealt with by the trial
    judge under rule 52.08(1)(c).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Burlie</i>,
    a jury concluded that the defendant did not contribute to any portion of
    the plaintiff’s injuries but then assessed general damages at $25,000.  The
    trial judge dismissed the plaintiff’s motion under rule 52.08(1)(c), holding
    that the jury’s answers were not conflicting because it had been instructed
    to assess damages even if it concluded that the defendant was not at fault.  On
    appeal, at para. 31, Charron J.A. said that the question whether a jury’s
    answers are conflicting differs from the question whether the answers themselves
    are reasonable:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge ultimately ruled that the answers
    were not conflicting and she dismissed the motion.  Although the question
    for determination on this appeal, the reasonableness of the verdict, is different
    from that raised on the rule 52.08 motion, there is much overlap between
    the arguments made on that motion and on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    she accepted that the jury’s answers did not conflict, Charron J.A. nonetheless
    considered whether the jury’s finding that the defendant was not at fault
    was reasonable – she held that it was.  By addressing the issue of reasonableness,
    Charron&nbsp;J.A. acknowledged that appellate review of a jury verdict not
    only differs from but is broader than a trial judge’s ruling under rule 52.08(1)(c).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus
    the trial judge’s rule 52.08(1)(c) ruling does not preclude this court from
    finding that the jury’s award of nothing for future income loss was unjust
    and unreasonable.</p>
  <h3>(4)       A reasonable award for Ms. Lazare’s future loss of income</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have concluded that the jury’s award of zero for Ms. Lazare’s future income
    loss is unjust and unreasonable.  I now have two choices: order a new trial
    on this issue or try to assess the loss myself.  I choose the latter option.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    an appeal from an award for damages for personal injury, s. 119 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-46 permits this court “if it considers
    it just” to “substitute its own assessment of the damages”.  My colleague
    says it would not be “just” for this court to assess damages because “credibility
    was the central issue” at trial. However, credibility was never the central
    issue at trial.  Indeed, it was not an issue at all, largely because the
    defendants chose to call no evidence. Neither at trial nor in this court
    did counsel for Ms. Lazare or the respondents suggest that this case turned
    on the credibility of the witnesses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this is the type of case where an appellate court should exercise
    its power under s. 119.  My view finds support in the judgment of Borins
    J.A. in <i>Padfield v. Martin</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 577 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  There at para. 56 he referred to the type of case where the court should
    substitute its own assessment of damages:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where the fairness of the trial is not in issue,
    and the jury appears simply to have arrived at an inappropriate assessment
    on the evidence, the interest in avoiding the delay and expense of a new
    trial would seem to weigh in favour of the appeal court substituting its
    own assessment. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case is the type of case Borins J.A. referred to.  The trial was fair; the
    trial judge’s charge to the jury was balanced and accurate; the accident
    occurred over six years ago; a new trial would cause delay and expense.  These
    considerations argue for having this court assess damages, even though the
    evidence on which to do so is not entirely satisfactory.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Lang J.A. points out, at trial Ms. Lazare rested her loss of future income
    claim on either of two bases: her injuries prevented her from becoming a
    lawyer; or her injuries will impede either her ability to work to normal
    retirement age (statistically 62) or her opportunity to obtain a high paying,
    high ranking job.  On appeal, Ms. Lazare abandoned her claim for future loss
    of income based on becoming a lawyer.  She likes her job at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Rogers, she was an active athlete before the accident, and she has always
    been interested in the business side of sports.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not find the expert evidence on future income loss led at trial very helpful.  Thus
    my award is but a guesstimate.  During oral argument, Ms. Lazare’s counsel
    suggested a figure of $480,000, which is a present value calculation that
    assumes an annual loss of earnings of $25,000 from age 35 until retirement
    at age 62 and uses appropriate multipliers.  The respondents did not suggest
    a different figure.  I accept this amount as a fair estimate of Ms. Lazare’s
    future loss of income and would award that amount to her.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C.        Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury’s failure to award Ms. Lazare any money for future income loss was unjust
    and unreasonable.  I would set aside the jury’s award and substitute a figure
    of $480,000.  The appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal in
    the agreed upon amount of $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
