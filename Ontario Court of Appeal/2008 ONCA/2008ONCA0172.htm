  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Debbie Rizzi, appeals from the judgment of Little J. following
    a seventeen-day jury trial.  The jury assessed damages against the respondents,
    George Mavros and Thomas Partalas, who were Ms. Rizzi’s landlords, on the
    basis that their improper storage of construction materials in the storage/laundry
    room of the apartment building led to<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> the appellant’s accident and consequent injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was awarded damages of $236,494.91, including pre-judgment interest.  The
    award included $41,000 for general or non-pecuniary damages, $17,400 for
    special damages, $660,500 for loss of past and future income and $160,000
    for future care costs.  The jury found the appellant seventy-five per cent
    contributorily negligent in attempting to move the materials and her award
    was reduced accordingly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant challenges the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the law
    regarding non-pecuniary damages, contributory negligence and the apportionment
    of fault.  Alternatively, the appellant argues that the jury’s finding on
    each of these issues is unreasonable.  The appellant also appeals the costs
    order.  The respondents argue that the trial judge correctly instructed the
    jury regarding the relevant law, the jury awards were supported by the evidence
    and the trial judge made no error in exercising his discretion regarding
    costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view and for the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge
    erred in instructing the jury to assess the appellant’s non-pecuniary damages
    on a scale using the upper limit or cap as a maximum.  However, I would find
    no error in the charge regarding contributory negligence or apportionment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    erroneous instruction regarding the cap would ordinarily require a new trial.  However,
    in this case, the jury award indicates the jury accepted the appellant’s
    credibility.  Since this makes possible an assessment of the extent of her
    pain and suffering, I would not order a new trial.  Rather, I would substitute
    a damages assessment of $80,000 for non-pecuniary damages.  I would reduce
    the challenged costs award by $5,500. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>FACTS  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was a thirty-two-year old dental hygienist who alleged that a leg
    injury caused neuropathic pain that evolved first into complex regional pain
    syndrome and later into fibromyalgia.  The appellant alleged that the fibromyalgia
    eventually prevented her from continuing any employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    injury occurred on April 2, 1995.  The appellant was attempting to store
    paint cans in her locker located in the storage room of the respondent’s
    apartment building.  When the appellant first entered the storage room, she
    observed the metal sheets, each the approximate size of an apartment door,
    as well as several boxes of construction materials that were lying on the
    floor between the two rows of lockers.  Although there was no urgency, the
    appellant decided she could store the paint cans by moving the sheets away
    from the lockers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that she had some initial concern about cutting her fingers
    on the sharp, jagged edges of the sheets, but despite this concern, she decided
    that she could move them safely.  Indeed, she succeeded in moving the first
    sheet easily, but had trouble with the remaining sheets because they were
    stacked tightly together.  She tried to separate them by pulling the sheets
    towards her, but she was unable to control their weight.  They forced her
    backwards until the heels of her feet came into contact with a surface.  She
    mistakenly assumed this surface to be the second row of lockers.  She leaned
    back for support.  Since the surface was actually a box of construction materials,
    the appellant lost her balance and fell backwards.  The metal sheets landed
    on her legs.  She was able to remove her left leg without injury, but as
    she tried to extricate her right leg, the sharp-edged sheets scraped her
    shin, causing immediate pain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was taken to hospital, where she was treated for her injuries and
    instructed to take two days of rest.  She subsequently consulted her family
    doctor.  The appellant could not bear weight on her leg for about two weeks.  She
    developed pain in her leg and an area of extreme sensitivity to touch, a
    condition known as allodynia. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    two weeks, the appellant returned to work, but she found it necessary to
    bear much of her weight on her left leg, which led to low back pain.  The
    appellant started to suffer from fatigue because she was unable to sleep
    properly.  She pursued treatment, including consultations with physiatrists,
    an orthopaedic surgeon, physiotherapists, chiropractors, a shiatsu specialist,
    an acupuncturist and a naturopath.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  A
    year after the accident, Dr. Teasell, a physiatrist, diagnosed neuropathic
    pain in the appellant’s leg, which resulted from damage to the appellant’s
    peripheral nerves.  This diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist,
    but no treatment was available.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that she eventually developed generalized pain throughout
    her entire body resulting in continued sleeplessness, fatigue and ultimately
    depression.  By the end of 1997, the appellant had stopped working and has
    not resumed employment since, except for her unsuccessful efforts to do so
    on a part-time basis from 2000 to 2003.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2003, Dr. Teasell diagnosed post-traumatic fibromyalgia, a diagnosis confirmed
    by other specialists.  Dr. Chaiton, a rheumatologist, also diagnosed the
    appellant with complex regional pain syndrome.  The medical evidence called
    by the appellant indicated that she was “quite significantly impaired” and
    that her condition would likely get worse with age. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ expert physiatrist and rheumatologist, Dr. Gyenes, testified
    that, in her opinion, the appellant did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis
    of either complex regional pain syndrome or fibromyalgia.  She pointed to
    inconsistencies in the appellant’s presentation, including the unexplained
    absence of muscle atrophy in her right leg.  It was Dr. Gyenes’ view that
    profound muscle atrophy would normally be evident in light of the appellant’s
    clinical history and the severity of her reported symptoms.  Dr. Gyenes also
    questioned the extent of the appellant’s reported allodynia because the appellant
    was able to wear trousers and apply a depilatory cream to her leg.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was the appellant’s position at trial that she had led a full and satisfying
    life before the accident, including active participation in sports.  She
    attributed all her post-accident difficulties to the injury to her shin.  However,
    evidence presented at trial indicated that the appellant suffered a pre-existing
    wrist injury.  A week before the accident, she reported to her physiotherapist
    that she was experiencing “more pain” in her right arm and wrist and that
    the right wrist had become hypersensitive to touch.  The physiotherapist
    made a treatment note querying whether the appellant was suffering from complex
    regional pain disorder.  However, the evidence at trial indicated the appellant
    had sufficient use of her wrist around the time of the accident to paint
    her apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    treatment for the leg injury was suspended some months after the incident,
    the appellant reported ongoing wrist pain that had spread to her right arm,
    shoulder and neck.  Physiotherapy for her upper body complaints continued
    for a further year.  After that, the appellant related her ongoing complaints
    exclusively to the shin injury.  </p>
  <h3>JURY VERDICT </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant urged the jury to award pecuniary damages in the amount
    of $1,484,862, plus an unspecified amount for non-pecuniary damages.  The
    respondents argued that any ongoing injury was related to the wrist injury
    and damages for the leg injury should be assessed at $10,000 to $15,000.  The
    jury assessed non-pecuniary damages at $41,000 and pecuniary damages at $837,900.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury answered the questions put to them as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Did the defendants take such care as
    in all the circumstances of the case was reasonable to see that the plaintiff
    was reasonably safe?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Answer:          No</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         If the answer to Question 1 is “No”
    list clearly the particulars of the defendants’ failure to care.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Answer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - Failed to store the sheets where
    the tenants could not access them</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - Failed to give tenants warning that
    the locker room will be closed for a certain length of time</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - Failed to restrict the access of
    the locker area.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         If your answer to Question 1 is “No”
    did the plaintiff use reasonable care on her own part for her own safety?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Answer:          No</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         If your answer to Question 3 is “No”
    list clearly the particulars of her contributory negligence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Answer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - She was negligent by trying to move
    the panels</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - She should have been aware of her
    own physical limitations – (received 20 treatments for physio for wrist) – <u>prior</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - She could of asked for help</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            - There was no urgency</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.         If both plaintiff and defendants are
    at fault, how do you apportion the degree of fault between the parties?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Answer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Plaintiff          75%</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Defendant       <u>25%</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Total               100%</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the jury specifically found the incident caused or materially contributed
    to the appellant’s condition of fibromyalgia/diffuse pain. </p>
  <h3>ISSUES </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises the following issues on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Did the trial judge correctly charge
    the jury regarding the assessment of <i>non-pecuniary damages</i> and, if
    so, was the jury’s assessment so inordinately low as to be unreasonable?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Did the trial judge correctly charge
    the jury regarding <i>contributory negligence</i> and, if so, was the jury’s
    finding of contributory negligence unreasonable?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Did the trial judge correctly charge
    the jury regarding the <i>apportionment</i><b> </b>of fault and, if so, was
    the jury’s apportionment unreasonable?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         Did the trial judge fail to consider
    relevant factors or reach an unreasonable conclusion with respect to the <i>costs</i> award?</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    examining each of these issues in turn, it is helpful to consider the standard
    of review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellants argue that the charge to the jury contained material
    misdirection or non-direction on the issues of non-pecuniary damages, contributory
    negligence and allocation of fault.  Since the challenged directions involve
    points of law, the standard of review is one of correctness, bearing in mind
    that any misdirection or non-direction must be material to the jury’s decision.  Jury
    charges are not to be parsed to a standard of perfection; rather, the question
    is whether, at the end of the charge, the jury would have properly understood
    the law:  <i>Pereira v. Hamilton Township Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance
    Co., </i>[2006] O.J. No. 1508 at para. 51 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    there is no error of law, the standard of review dictates that a jury verdict
    will only be set aside as against the weight of the evidence where it is
    so plainly unreasonable and unjust that no jury, reviewing the evidence as
    a whole and acting judicially could have reached it: <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen, </i>[2002]
    2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 30. </p>
  <h3>1.         NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the contentious issue of the cap, the trial judge instructed the jury:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She is only coming once.  It has got to be decided.  But
    you would also say when you look at that, the maximum awards in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for a young person who is made a quadriplegic for pain and suffering is just
    less than $300,000.00.  So your range would be somewhere between zero and
    $300,000.00 for her pain on that item only.  That is the maximum.  <i>You
    would have to scale it.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has provided direction on the approach to a jury
    charge about the cap.  In <i>ter Neuzen v. Korn</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674,
    Sopinka J., speaking for the majority, noted that the trial judge should
    not charge the jury on the cap where he or she is of the opinion that the
    injuries “will not likely produce an award approaching the rough upper limit.”  (para.
    113)  However, the trial judge should instruct the jury about the cap, after
    considering counsels’ submissions and the type of injury sustained, if he
    or she is of the opinion that damages may be assessed in a range exceeding
    that amount.  In such circumstances, the instructions “may include an explanation
    of the reason for the cap.” (para. 112)</p>

    Comments on Conduct of a Civil Jury Trial&rdquo; in Civil Jury Charges: Draft
    [unpublished] at 24, distils the principles set out in <i>ter Neuzen</i> for a trial judge preparing a civil jury charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>i)         If the trial judge is of the view that damages are of the
      type that may be assessed in the range of, or exceeding, the upper limit
      the jury should be advised of it and instructed that their assessment for
      non pecuniary damages should not exceed that amount.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>ii)        If the charge is to instruct on the upper limit, it should
      include an explanation of why there is such a limit. He [Sopinka J.] suggests
      the jury be told the imposition of an upper limit may seem somewhat arbitrary,
      but it has been established by the courts to deal with those cases in which
      there will be full compensation for lost income, future care and future
      income loss the award for non pecuniary damages has been limited to include
      compensation for the misfortune suffered, loss of enjoyment of life and
      for the pain and suffering involved.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-GB>iii)       If the judge is of the view the injuries will not likely
      approach that upper limit, it is best that the judge not charge the jury
      on that matter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the first question is whether the damages in this case could have been assessed
    at or near the cap.  This is somewhat difficult to answer contextually because
    this court was not provided with either a transcript of any pre-charge conference
    or with trial counsels’ submissions to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    we do know that, although the appellant’s counsel did not suggest any particular
    amount or range for non-pecuniary damages, he argued that the appellant’s
    injuries included fibromyalgia that prevented her from working and precluded
    her from engaging in many of her normal physical and social activities.  Further,
    in his objection to the charge about using the cap as a scale, the appellant’s
    counsel argued that the jury could decide that the appellant’s damages exceeded
    the cap.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the trial judge did not accept that damages could be awarded at or near the
    cap, the proper position would have been to refrain from charging the jury
    regarding that limit.  However, in light of the evidence and the position
    of the appellant’s trial counsel, I conclude that the trial judge was of
    the view that non-pecuniary damages could be awarded at or near the cap and,
    for this reason, decided to instruct the jury on that issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    providing this instruction, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in directing the jury to use the cap as a <i>scale</i> from which to measure
    damages.  In support of this objection, he relies on the decision of this
    court in <i>Koukounakis v. Stainrod</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 299.  In that
    case, the appellants challenged a jury assessment of non-pecuniary damages
    arguing that it was so high as to be unreasonable.  In explaining the reasons
    why non-pecuniary damages cannot be assessed on a scale using the cap as
    a maximum, Doherty J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The judicially imposed upper limit on general non-pecuniary
    damages offers some assistance in determining the appropriateness of a particular
    award. <i>The appropriateness of an award, however, cannot be determined
    by comparing the level of disability or pain and suffering suffered by a
    particular plaintiff to that of a person entitled to the maximum award: </i>Howes
    v. Crosby, supra, at p. 460. The upper limit serves to cap the potential
    award for general non-pecuniary damages. It is in large measure an arbitrary
    figure fixed in response to policy concerns, and on the assumption that awards
    made under other heads of damage will largely achieve the compensation goal:

      in concluding that the cap would have no relevance in the non-pecuniary
      damages assessment for most jury trials, emphasized that the cap “is not
      to be used as a scale against which all non-pecuniary claims for other
      injuries are to be measured.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    that it is appropriate to instruct a jury on the cap, and recognizing that
    such an instruction runs the risk of a direct comparison between the damages
    in the particular case with those that merit an award at the cap, a trial
    judge must explain to the jury that such a comparison is not appropriate.  In
    particular, the trial judge must explain that the cap is not to be seen as
    the upper end of a range of damages awards, but rather that the cap was established
    for the policy reasons discussed in <i>Andrews v. Grand
    &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229 at pp. 260-61<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>.  In that case, Dickson J. explained that a jury
    will not attempt to set a value on the loss of a plaintiff’s function, because
    that function cannot be restored.  Nor, for the same reason, will the award
    be assessed on the basis of the value of lost happiness.  Rather, an award
    will be determined that provides the plaintiff with the ability to make more
    general arrangements, beyond those relating directly to the injuries, so
    that his or her life will be more endurable.  Those arrangements will aim
    to alleviate the plaintiff’s misfortune by allowing him or her to live as
    tolerably as possible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    quantifying non-pecuniary damages, the jury should understand that the rough
    upper limit reflects the reality that no amount of money can compensate for
    the plaintiff’s loss of quality of life or his or her pain and suffering.  A
    cap on non-pecuniary damages was imposed for policy reasons relating to the
    heavy financial burden that otherwise would result from excessive awards.  In
    these circumstances, it would be wrong to use the cap to compare a particular
    plaintiff’s injuries to that of a person entitled to the cap.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    a jury told about the cap generally must also be told that its assessment
    of pecuniary damages is paramount, because it is those damages that give
    the plaintiff the funds to compensate for lost income and to provide for
    future care.  The assessment of the plaintiff’s non-pecuniary damages differs
    because it is a philosophical and policy exercise that, although necessarily
    arbitrary, must be in an amount that is reasonable and fair both to the plaintiff
    and to society as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the jury was not instructed on the policy reasons for the cap.  Moreover,
    it was told to use the cap as a scale and to compare the appellant’s injuries
    to those of a young quadriplegic.  This instruction was in error, as was
    the trial judge’s refusal to re-instruct the jury after the appellant’s objection
    to this aspect of the charge. </p>

    the question of contributory negligence, the trial judge charged the jury
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, you have to decide that she would be negligent
    in failing to take reasonable care for her own safety.  This time the onus
    rests on the Defendants.  Negligence here means doing something that a reasonably
    prudent person would not do, or the failure to do something that a reasonably
    prudent person would do; and you have to look at the circumstances of this
    case.  The standard of care upon which you base that is the conduct of an
    average person.  It is not an extraordinary conscientious person, it is not
    an excessively skilled person, but a reasonable person exercising average
    ordinary prudence.  You must decide if – whether a reasonably prudent person
    would have exercised or taken care of her own safety in the circumstance – in
    that matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s counsel did not object to this part of the charge at trial.  The
    absence of an objection suggests that the issue was not seen as central to
    the jury’s deliberations.  However, on appeal, the appellant argues the trial
    judge ought to have instructed the jury to consider whether the appellant <i>subjectively</i> foresaw
    the consequences of her action, including the mechanism by which the accident
    would occur and the risk of the injury that she would suffer.  The appellant
    argues that this was important because, while the appellant recognized the
    risk of cutting her fingers on the sheets, she did not foresee either the
    possibility of the sheets knocking her over or the injury to her shin. </p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  At para. 26 of that decision, Charron J. quotes <i>Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda)
    Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd</i>., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210 at para. 76
    regarding the foreseeability element for contributory negligence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The test …
    was summarized by Denning L.J. in <i>Jones v. Livox Quarries Ld.</i>, [1952]
    2 Q.B. 608 (C.A.), at p. 615: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Although contributory negligence does not depend
    on a duty of care, it does depend on foreseeability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as actionable
    negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to others, so <i><u>contributory
    negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to oneself.</u></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;A
    person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have
    foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man, he might be
    hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into account the possibility
    of others being careless.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    flaw in the appellant’s argument is that the reference to foreseeability
    of harm to oneself is immediately qualified by reference to the standard
    of a “reasonable, prudent” individual.  Considered together, it is clear
    that the court endorses an objective and not a subjective analysis of foreseeability. </p>

    32, where the court notes that “the injured party will be guilty of contributory
    negligence if it ought to have foreseen that it may harm itself by failing
    to act reasonably and prudently”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    a party is negligent (in this case, contributorily negligent) if she objectively
    ought to have foreseen that she might injure herself.  The objective test
    is implicit in the trial judge’s charge, which included a number of references
    to the reasonable person and to reasonable care.  A reasonably prudent person,
    by definition, considers whether a course of action might result in harm. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Since
    the appellant specifically acknowledged that she subjectively appreciated
    there was a risk of cutting her fingers on the metal sheets while moving
    them, it was not necessary for the respondents to establish that she also
    foresaw either the mechanism by which the accident would occur or the nature
    of the injury that could result.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this ground

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In any action for damages that is founded upon

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), which discussed the distinct issue of the difference between active and
    passive faults.  At paragraph 29 of his reasons, in distinguishing between
    fault and causation, Juriansz J.A. refers to <i>Cempel v. Harrison Hot Springs
    Hotel Ltd</i>. (1997), <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman";'><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>43 B.C.L.R.
    (3d) 219</span></span> (B.C.C.A.) at para. 19, where Lambert J.A. emphasized
    that the <i>Negligence Act </i>“does not say that the apportionment should
    be on the basis of degree to which each person’s fault caused the damage”.  Lambert
    J.A. concluded “we are not assessing degrees of causation, we are assessing
    degrees of fault.  In this context, &quot;fault&quot; means blameworthiness.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    apportionment relates to fault or blameworthiness, it would have been preferable
    if the trial judge had avoided “but for” terminology, which evokes causation
    principles for those familiar with tort principles.  However, a jury is not
    familiar with tort principles.  Moreover, the challenged charge must be considered
    in its context and not subject to abundant parsing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge specifically instructed the jury to “apportion the degree
    of fault.”  He did not direct the jury about causation in respect of apportionment.  Indeed,
    causation was a matter separately addressed in another part of the charge
    using the different language of material contribution.  In this context,
    the jury would have taken the “but for” reference to refer to the negligence
    of the parties and not to the causation of the injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    after the “but for” terminology, the trial judge immediately told the jury
    to attribute “it” out of 100, referring back to his instruction about the
    parties’ relative degrees of fault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the question put to the jury was both correctly phrased and specific:  “If
    both plaintiff and defendants are at fault, how do you apportion the degree
    of fault between the parties?”  Importantly, the jury had this precise question
    with it in written form in the jury room when it assessed the parties’ respective
    degrees of fault and determined that the moral blameworthiness of the appellant
    was greater than that of the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I am not persuaded that the jury’s apportionment of seventy-five per cent
    of blame to the appellant indicates that it was misled by the trial judge’s
    charge.  The appellant has submitted a number of cases where contributory
    negligence is assessed at twenty-five per cent.  However, each of these cases<b> </b>involves
    circumstances in which the defendant was the “prime cause” of all the damage
    or
    “wholly responsible” for the negligent act and the injured plaintiff only
    “contributed” to the damages he or she suffered.  This is consistent with <i>Snushall
    v. Fulsang</i> at para. 35, in which Juriansz J.A. concluded that, “contributory
    negligence, solely for failing to wear a seatbelt, should not exceed 25 per
    cent.”  See also <i>Heeney v. Best </i>(1979), 28 O.R. (2d) 71 (

    high, seventy-five per cent is not outside the range available on the evidence.  The
    same apportionment was allotted in <i>Hunt (Litigation Guardian of) v. Sutton
    Group Incentive Realty Inc.</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 425 (S.C.J.), on the
    basis that the plaintiff was largely the author of her or his own misfortune
    for drinking and driving, and in <i>Kennedy v. Waterloo County Board of Education </i>(1999),

    in this case, the jury made specific findings about the negligence of both
    the appellant and the respondents.  The jury determined that the respondents
    were negligent in failing to restrict access to the room in which the sheets
    were stored and in failing to warn the tenants that they would not have access
    to that room.  However, the jury found that the appellant was negligent in
    trying to move the sheets when aware of her own limitations and in a situation
    where there was no urgency and where she could have asked for help.  These
    findings support the jury’s determination that the appellant was the author
    or her own misfortune and that her blameworthiness was greater than that
    of the respondents’.  </p>

    asks this court to substitute its own assessment of damages as permitted
    by the <i>Courts of Justice Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43, s.&nbsp;119,
    which provides that “[o]n an appeal from an award for damages for personal
    injury, the court may, if it considers it just, substitute its own assessment
    of the damages.”  In arguing that it is in the interests of justice for this
    court to substitute its own assessment of damages, the appellant emphasizes
    the amount of time that has passed since the date of the accident.  In oral
    argument, the respondent took the position that a new trial is necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Padfield

    ), Borins J.A. observed that an appellate court may refuse to substitute
    its own assessment and instead order a new trial where there has been an
    error of law.  He noted that an appellate court would likely substitute its
    own assessment of damages where the fairness of the trial is not an issue
    and the jury simply reached an inappropriate assessment.  However, a new
    trial is likely where errors in the conduct of the trial may have affected
    the outcome.  Often, he said, it would not be just for an appellate court
    to substitute its own assessment if the error constitutes a substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice that otherwise warrants a new trial.  Finally,
    Borins J.A. concluded that “an appeal court ultimately maintains the wide
    discretion under ss. 119 and 134 to grant whatever relief is sought by the
    successful party.”</p>

    my view, the error in this case, while an error of law, is not one that precludes

      will be stale, and the cost is prohibitive. Instead, this court should
      perform the apportionment task that the jury ought to have been instructed

      the incident occurred more than twelve years ago, memories will be stale
      and a new trial may well not be feasible.  In addition to the difficulties
      inherent in assembling the lay witnesses, the medical witnesses or their
      records may no longer be available and their recollections of the appellant
      and her injuries will have faded.  In addition, the costs of a new trial

    the error in this case, while one of law, does not affect the fairness of
    the trial or its outcome.  Rather, the error goes solely to the amount of
    the appellant’s non-pecuniary damages.  In addition, the jury’s award of
    pecuniary damages, which is not tainted by any error, provides substantial
    guidance because it is apparent that the jury believed the appellant’s evidence
    about the extent of her injuries.  As well, it is apparent that the jury
    rejected the evidence of the respondents that attempted to undermine the
    appellant’s testimony about her symptoms and condition.  In all the circumstances

    v. Open Window Bakery Ltd., </i>[2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at para. 27.  In this
    case, I see no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge’s costs
    award with one exception regarding a disbursement for an expert report.  In
    my view, the $5,500 disbursement for the PriceWaterhouseCooper report must
    be disallowed because the report was not supplied to the appellant as contemplated

    cannot accept the appellant’s other challenges to the award.  The appellant
    argues that the award effectively allowed costs on a substantial indemnity
    scale contrary to the decision of this court in <i>Boucher v. Public Accountants
    Council for the Province of Ontario </i>(2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291.  While
    there was not a significant difference between the substantial and partial
    indemnity rates put forward by counsel in this case, the situation is not

    of costs.  <b><u></u></b></p>

    do I see any basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge’s careful
    conclusion on the other issues raised by the appellant.  In particular, I
    see no error in the trial judge’s decision that the trial was not unnecessarily
    prolonged by the defence or that the <i>voir dire</i> regarding the causal
    link between the leg injury and fibromyalgia was necessary.  Clearly the
    question about the connection between the injury and the appellant’s complaints
    was the primary point of controversy at trial and it was entirely within
    the discretion of the trial judge to include costs for the <i>voir dire</i> and
    the defence expert witnesses in his award to the respondents.  </p>

      court’s most recent affirmation of this principle is found in the judgment
      of my colleague Juriansz J.A. in <i>Snushall v. Fulsang</i> (2005), 78
      O.R. (3d) 412.  There, at para. 29, he quotes with approval the following
      paragraph from the reasons of Lambert&nbsp;J.A. writing for the majority
      of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Cempel</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I think that such an approach
      to apportionment [a comparative causation approach] is wrong in law.  The <i>Negligence
      Act</i> requires that the apportionment must be made on the basis of “the
      degree to which each person was at fault”.  It does not say that the apportionment
      should be on the basis of the degree to which each person’s fault caused
      the damage.  So we are not assessing degrees of causation, we are assessing
      degrees of fault. In this context, “fault” means blameworthiness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      Lang J.A. and I agree on the principle.  What divides us is whether the
      trial judge accurately instructed the jury on it.  For ease of reference,
      I repeat his brief charge on apportionment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Then you get down to Question
      Number Five and you say, if both the plaintiff and the defendants are at
      fault, how do you apportion the degree of fault between the parties?  That
      can go from zero to 100 in each case, and you would decide.  <i>You would
      say that this incident would not have occurred but for</i>, and you would
      apportion it.  The total has to come to 100.  So you would total it right
      in there and it would total 100 and you would attribute it. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Once you have done that, that
      is all for “who is responsible”.  You forget about that now.  [Emphasis
      added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      explaining to the jury how to apportion fault, the trial judge posed the
      question: “[H]ow do you apportion the degree of fault between the parties?”  One
      sentence later, he answered it: “You would say that this incident would
      not have occurred but for, and you apportion it.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      finding no reversible error in the charge, my colleague says that the “but
      for”
    reference would not invite the jurors to apportion on the basis of causation
    because they are not familiar with tort principles; that the trial judge
    properly asked them to apportion the degrees of “fault”; and that the jury’s
    apportionment of seventy-five per cent of the blame to Ms. Rizzi does not
    indicate it was misled as the evidence shows Ms. Rizzi was “the author of
    her own misfortune”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      take a different view for there reasons.  First, “but for” is the classic
      and familiar language of causation, recognized as such not just by lawyers
      but by lay people too.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      although the trial judge used the word “fault”, he did not tell the jurors
      what the word meant.  He did not tell them to assess comparative blameworthiness,
      or explain what that term means.  Instead, on the trial judge’s instructions,
      the jury’s sole focus would have been on apportioning the degrees of causation.  The
      trial judge buttressed that focus with the concluding sentence of his charge
      on apportionment: “Once you have done that, that is all for who is ‘responsible’.”  Directing
      the jurors to allocate responsibility invited them to consider who “caused” the
      accident.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And
      finally, instructing the jury to answer whether the incident would have
      occurred but for each party’s fault improperly invites the jury to allocate
      the major share of fault to the party who had the “last chance” to avoid
      the accident – in this case to Ms.&nbsp;Rizzi because her actions occurred
      later in time.  However, we have abolished the
    “last clear chance” doctrine: see <i>Treaty Group Inc. v. Drake International
    Inc</i>. (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 366 at para. 28 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  We should not resurrect it under the rubric of apportioning fault.  Fruman
    J.A. made this very point in <i>Heller </i>at para.&nbsp;25:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The doctrine of last clear chance
      can appear in many guises, often couched in the language of causation,
      or confused with remoteness.  But it always fails to recognize that “each
      component of liability is only a facet of the whole, and judgment must
      be on the entirety, not piecemeal on refractions from each facet”: <i>Abbott </i>v<i>.
      Kasza<b> </b></i><a name=reflex-caselaw-33007642></a>(1976),<b><i> </i></b>71
      D.L.R. (3d) 581 at 589 (Alta. S.C. App. Div.).  In this case, for example,
      Martens argues that Heller’s injuries were entirely caused by his failure
      to wear a seat belt, and therefore his damages should be reduced by 100%.  This
      approach ignores Martens’ failure to stop at a stop sign and instead penalizes
      Heller, who, by wearing a seat belt, might have had the last chance to
      avoid injury.  Courts should not resurrect the last clear chance doctrine,
      abolished by legislative choice, by masquerading it as an apportionment
      theory.</span><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here,
      because of the trial judge’s instruction, I think there was a real risk
      the jury approached the apportionment of fault by asking who had the last
      chance to avoid the accident.  How else can the jury’s allocating seventy-five
      per cent of the fault to Ms. Rizzi be explained when the landlord created
      the hazard in the first place, and was best positioned to warn its tenants
      of the danger or eliminate the danger altogether?  Even suggesting, as
      my colleague does, that Ms. Rizzi “was the author of her own misfortune”,
      respectfully, is simply another way of saying that Ms. Rizzi caused her
      own injuries because she had the last chance to avoid them by waiting until
      the landlord removed the metal sheets before returning the paint supplies
      to her locker: see <i>Cempel</i> at paras. 18, 20.</span></p>

      awarded by the jury.  In my view, fault should be apportioned seventy-five
      per cent to the landlord and twenty-five per cent to Ms. Rizzi.  The landlord
      should bear the greater share of fault because, as I have said, it created
      the danger and then failed to take steps either to eliminate or at least
      warn its tenants of it.  Indeed, though Ms. Rizzi was negligent, it was
      understandable that she would want to use her locker when she did.  Accordingly,

      J.A. would increase the jury’s award for general non-pecuniary damages
      from $41,000 to $80,000.  On her assessment and leaving the jury’s apportionment
      intact, Ms. Rizzi would receive an additional $9,750 (plus prejudgment
