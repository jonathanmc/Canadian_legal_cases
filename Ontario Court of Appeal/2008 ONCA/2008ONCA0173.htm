line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal concerns the allocation of the burden of proof on a prosecution under
    s. 55(1) of the <i>Immigration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2.  That provision
    made it an offence for a person who had been deported to return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    “without the written consent of the Minister”, unless an appeal from the
    deportation order has been allowed.  The appellant submits that the burden
    was on the Crown to prove that he did not have the written consent of the
    Minister and since it failed to do so, he should have been acquitted.  In
    the alternative, the appellant appeals against the sentence of seven months
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    provision is now repealed and replaced by s. 52(1) of the <i>Immigration
    and Refugee Protection Act</i>, S.C. 2001, c. 27, which is similar but not
    identical to s. 55(1).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This appeal is somewhat complicated by the fact
    that the information charged the appellant with the offence under s. 52(1),
    even though the parties agree that if any offence was committed it was under
    the <i>Immigration Act</i> when the appellant admittedly returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1996.  However, the appellant concedes that he was not prejudiced by the
    error and that if this court is of the view that he was properly convicted
    the information should be amended in accordance with ss. 683(1)(g) and 601(3)(a)
    of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the burden was on the Crown to prove that the appellant did not
    have the Minister’s consent to return to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  I am also satisfied that the Crown failed to adduce sufficient evidence
    to make out that element of the offence and, accordingly, the conviction
    was unreasonable.</p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and enter an acquittal.  In
    light of that disposition, I need not deal with the question whether this
    would be an appropriate case to amend the information as requested by the
    Crown.</p>

    appellant was tried on two offences.  In addition to the illegal entry charge
    that is the subject of this appeal, the appellant was charged with an offence
    contrary to the <i>Citizenship Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    evidence led by the prosecution was as follows.  Someone using the name of “John
    Haughton” received landed status in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1986.  Using that name, the appellant was convicted of several criminal
    offences and was deported on July 6, 1995 as a result of
    “criminality”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 21, 1996 the appellant received landed status in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    using his true name, Andrew Maurice Williams.  He became a Canadian citizen
    on September 22, 2004.  The appellant established through cross-examination
    of the only Crown witness, a member of the R.C.M.P. immigration and passport
    section, that records relating to the appellant in the Canadian High Commission
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    had been destroyed.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown filed a number of documents pursuant to the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5<i>.  </i>Among the documents listed in the notice of
    intention to introduce records under the Act is listed “Certificate – No
    Consent to Return”.  However, Crown counsel did not attempt to file that
    document.  He did, however, file one document that is of interest to the
    ground of appeal raised in this case: a copy of a “Immigrant Visa and Record
    of Landing”.  It appears that most of this document was prepared in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston,
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  The word “no” is typed beside the question:  “Have you ever been convicted
    of a crime or an offence, refused admission to

    the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the trial judge dismissed an application
    for a directed verdict on the illegal entry charge but allowed the application
    in respect of the <i>Citizenship Act</i> charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1992 using John Haughton’s papers.  He admitted that the criminal record
    under Haughton’s name contains convictions for offences for which he had
    been convicted in 1994.  He also admitted that he was deported under the
    name of Haughton on July 6, 1995.  Using his real name, he returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    on April 21, 1996 having been sponsored by his wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that before returning in 1996 he dealt with a woman at
    the Canadian High Commission in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  He told the woman that he had already been to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    illegally and was deported, and filled out some papers that showed he had
    been in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    under a different name.  The woman then gave him the visa and a piece of
    paper “that permit me to come back”.  The appellant said that these documents
    were in his apartment in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Stoney Creek but he had not been able to get them since he had been in custody
    for two years.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination, the appellant was asked about the word “no” typed beside
    the question:  “Have you ever been convicted of a crime or an offence, refused
    admission to
    <st1:country-region

    , required to leave
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ?” in the Immigrant Visa and Record of Landing.  The appellant claimed not
    to be able to make out the word “no”.  During cross-examination Crown counsel
    also produced to the appellant his application for Canadian citizenship.  In
    answer to a series of questions, including the question whether he had ever
    been under a deportation order, the appellant had checked the box:  “Do not
    apply to me.”  The appellant was not asked for an explanation for this falsehood.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant was asked what efforts he had made to retrieve the document
    giving him permission to return to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He testified that he was living alone when he was arrested and there was
    nobody to contact to get his document.  He said everything in the apartment
    was lost.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge began his reasons by stating that there was “no evidence given
    that an officer allowed [the appellant] to return to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    as proof of the fact stated”.  After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge
    rejected the appellant’s testimony that he had received permission to return
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He took into account that the appellant had made no effort to get the
    document he claimed to have received in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    and that he lied in the Immigrant Visa and Record of Landing and lied in
    the citizenship application.  The trial judge stated that he believed the
    appellant “neither sought, nor was given permission by any official to return
    to this country”.  The trial judge stated that the Crown had proved the case
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then,
    the trial judge turned to the appellant’s argument that the burden was on
    the Crown to prove that he did not have permission to return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The trial judge rejected that position in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, there
    need not be any legislative provision in order for the Crown to make out
    its case.  The burden is always on the Crown to prove the allegations beyond
    a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There comes
    a time, however, when the burden of adducing evidence compels the production
    of an excuse, proviso, or other reasonable description when it is alleged
    that a certain individual did a thing without the requisite permission.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    as I have noted, the Crown has proven its case; and I find the accused guilty
    as charged.</p>

    for the appellant submits that “without the written consent of the Minister” is
    an element of the offence.  Section 55(1) of the <i>Immigration Act</i> did
    not expressly shift the burden of proof of that element to the accused and,
    consistent with <i>Charter</i> values, it should not be interpreted as doing
    so.  She also points out that s. 794(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>which
    puts the burden of proof for an “exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or
    qualification” on the defendant, only applies in summary conviction proceedings.  In
    this case, the Crown proceeded by indictment.  She also notes that in upholding
    the constitutionality of provisions such as s. 794(2), the courts have tended
    to give it a restricted interpretation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    counsel submits that placing the burden on the appellant with respect to
    consent to enter Canada is consistent with the common law principle recognized
    by the English Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Edwards</i>, [1975] 1 Q.B. 27.  He
    submits that this principle is not limited to summary conviction offences
    and should apply in the circumstances of this case.  Although s. 794(2) and <i>Edwards</i> appear
    to have been interpreted as placing a persuasive burden on the accused,<a href="#_ftn2"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Mr. Rahman only argues that there should be an
    evidentiary burden on the accused.  As such, he submits, there would be no
    violation of the <i>Charter</i>.  I point out that Mr. Rahman did not base
    his argument on the theory that requiring the Crown to prove lack of consent
    would place a difficult or impossible burden on the prosecution.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    a document to prove lack of consent but, for some reason, did not tender
    it: see also <i>R. v. Suraleigh</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 807  (C.J.).</p>

    were referred to two decisions that have considered the interpretation of
    the unlawful entry offence.  In <i>R. v. Singh </i>(1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d)
    156 (Man. Co. Ct.), Jewers Co. Ct. J. considered former s. 57(1) of the <i>Immigration
    Act</i>, 1976, which was worded in virtually identical terms to s. 55(1).  The
    Crown had proceeded by way of summary conviction and Jewers Co. Ct. J. held
    that the burden was on the accused to prove that he had the consent of the
    Minister by reason of former s. 730(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (now s.
    794(2)).  My reading of <i>Singh</i> suggests that Jewers Co. Ct. J. was
    of the view that there is a persuasive burden on the accused to prove consent.</p>

      J.A. was aware of the earlier decision in <i>Singh</i>, but he limited

      my view, the holding in <i>Zeplin</i> is preferable because it is generally
      consistent with the approach taken by this court in interpreting a similar
      offence in the <i>Criminal Code.  </i>Section 121(1)(c) makes it an offence
      for a government official to accept from a person having dealings with
      the government any kind of benefit for himself or a member of his family
    “unless he has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of government
    that employs him”.  In <i>R. v. Greenwood</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 435
    at 445-446 and again in <i>R. v. Fisher</i> (1994), </span>88 C.C.C. (3d)
    103, this court held that the absence of consent of the accused’s superior
    is an element of the offence.  In <i>Fisher</i>, the court went on to hold
    a portion of s. 121(1)(c), which placed the onus on the accused to prove
    consent on a balance of probabilities, unjustifiably violated the presumption
    of innocence contrary to s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>

    it is my view that lack of written consent of the Minister should be considered

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    , for example as a visitor, is not a criminal offence.  What makes it an

    it is an element of the offence, the Crown has the burden of proving beyond

    is neither a persuasive burden nor evidentiary burden on the accused: see

    will also briefly consider the application of the common law rule in <i>Edwards.  </i>As
    indicated, the Crown submits that the common law principle referred to in <i>Edwards</i> and
    codified for summary conviction offences in s. 794(2) applies.  The Crown
    submits that it is a common law principle that in certain circumstances an
    accused has the burden of proving, or at least the evidentiary burden of
    leading some evidence, that he has a status in law that would permit him
    to do an otherwise prohibited act.  The common law principle was expressed
    in <i>Edwards </i>in the following terms at pp. 39-40:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      our judgment this line of authority establishes that over the centuries
      the common law, as a result of experience and the need to ensure that justice
      is done both to the community and to defendants, has evolved an exception
      to the fundamental rule of our criminal law that the prosecution must prove
      every element of the offence charged. This exception, like so much else
      in the common law, was hammered out on the anvil of pleading. It is limited
      to offences arising under enactments which prohibit the doing of an act
      save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified classes or with
      specified qualifications or with the licence or permission of specified
      authorities. Whenever the prosecution seeks to rely on this exception,
      the court must construe the enactment under which the charge is laid. If
      the true construction is that the enactment prohibits the doing of acts,
      subject to provisos, exemptions and the like, then the prosecution can
      rely upon the exception.</span></p>

      exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification” as opposed to an element of
      the offence or a defence?  Some assistance is provided by the decision
      of this court in <i>R. v. H. (P.)</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 223 at para.
      14.  The offence of occupying a vehicle known to be taken without the owner’s
      consent under s. 335(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is subject to s. 335(1.1),
      which provides that the offence does not apply to an individual who attempts
      to leave the vehicle on becoming aware that it was taken without the owner’s
      consent.  In <i>H. (P.)</i>, Finlayson J.A. explained the relatively narrow
      reach of s.&nbsp;794(2) in a prosecution for the offence under s. 335(1):</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='

      application to the defence set out in s. 335(1.1). <i>It applies in narrow

      written consent of the Minister does not comfortably fit within the concept
      of
    “a status in law [that] has been conferred upon the accused who otherwise
    would be culpable”.  As I understand the scheme of the <i>Immigration Act</i>,
    the Minister’s written consent constituted permission for the act of entry
    or, in the words of the provision, to “come into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”.  It does not confer any status, such as refugee, visitor or landed status,
    on the former deportee.  Nor, in my view, would it be accurate to characterize
    the s. 55(1) offence as a regulatory offence, and Crown counsel did not suggest
    otherwise.  The section creates a criminal offence, exemplified in this case
    by the significant prison sentence imposed on this appellant.</span></p>

      L.J. in <i>R. v. Edwards, supra</i>, said, referring to the experience

      the exception with which he was concerned and justice, he clearly did not
      consider the exception put the accused “in a most unfair position”, rather
      that it was a just position and I think it is fair to say that our Legislature
      and Parliament, has so regarded it over these many years. As my brother
      Dubin commented during the argument: “How could it be unfair to ask a person

      the written consent upon entering Canada, whether the person must hand
      it in at the border to the immigration officer but keeps a copy, whether
      it is attached to the visa or passport and so on.  In any event, consider

      the consent of the government employee’s superior to the s. 121(1)(c) offence,
      the Minister’s consent is not a licensing scheme.  The words of Arbour
      J.A. in <i>Fisher</i> at p. 113 are helpful in understanding the difference:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      is not analogous to a registration certificate, or to a licence or permit.
      In fact, the only thing that might suggest otherwise is the requirement
      that the consent be in writing. <i>Typically, a licensing scheme is one
      that regulates and monitors a field of activity for a fee. There is no
      suggestion, in s. 121, of governments administering a licensing scheme
      to permit their employees to obtain benefits and rewards from government
      contractors.</i> What is contemplated by the requirement that government
      employees obtain the consent of their superiors before accepting benefits
      is the removal of any secrecy and the judgment of a person in authority
      to the effect that the proposed gift will not compromise the integrity
      of the government. <i>What the employee obtains from his or her superior
      is not a permit or a licence, but a consent. There are other activities
      governed by the </i>Criminal Code<i> which may be criminal absent a person’s
      consent, but not so if consent is obtained.</i> Assault and theft readily
      come to mind. I would not be prepared to hold that the consent contemplated
      by s. 121(1)(<i>c</i>) becomes a form of licensing merely because it has
      to be in writing….  I, therefore, conclude that the reverse onus provision
      contained in s. 121(1)(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code</i> infringes s. 11(d)
