      of contracts for the supply of electrical power.  The sole issue on appeal
      is whether these contracts continue to include a perpetual right to renew
      a supply of 5000 horsepower of electricity at a preferential rate, as originally
      provided in the initial 1928 contract.  The arbitrator, Earl Cherniak,
      Q.C., held that the perpetual right to renew had been extinguished.  On
      appeal to the Superior Court of Justice, Perell J. held that the perpetual
      right to renew remained extant and overturned the arbitrator’s decision.  For
      the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and restore the arbitrator’s
      award, although for reasons that differ somewhat from those expressed by
      the arbitrator.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         The COMPANY [GLP] AGREES:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(A)      To continue to reserve and to supply and
    deliver to the Corporation [PUC] the four thousand (4000) horsepower hereinbefore

      provided that written notice was given by PUC to GLP six months before
      the end of each term (the “perpetual renewal provision”).  The terms of
      renewal were set out in paragraph 12 of the 1928 Agreement as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This contract shall be and remain in full force

    further period of ten (10) years and on the expiration of the said renewal
    then for further renewals of ten (10) years each up to and including a third
    renewal so as to make the term of this contract with renewals, optional to
    the Corporation [PUC], a period of forty (40) years, and <i>in so far as
    this contract refers to and deals with the blocks of power referred to in

    right beyond the said forty (40) year period for such further renewal periods

      that amended and extended the 1989 Agreement for a further potential ten-year
      term (two potential renewals of five years each), dependent on the parties’ agreement
      on rates.  The 1998 Agreement expressly provided that only those provisions
      of the 1928 Agreement that had been incorporated by reference into the
      1989 Agreement continued to exist.  As with the 1989 Agreement, the 1998

      2003, the 1989 Agreement as amended by the 1998 Agreement came to an end

      that notwithstanding the termination of that agreement, the 1928 Agreement
      continued to exist and continued the obligation to supply the 5000 hp block
      at the rates specified in the 1928 Agreement in perpetuity, subject to
      the required notice of renewal every ten years.  GLP, on the other hand,
      argued that the 5000 hp block component of the 1928 Agreement, including
      the perpetual renewal provision, expired in accordance with its terms in
      1987; that the 1989 Agreement as amended by the 1998 Agreement did not
      provide for any further renewals; and that the parties’ entire relationship
      ended in 2003.  </span></p>

      dispute was heard by an arbitrator, pursuant to the parties’ contractual
      agreement to submit disputes to arbitration.  In reasons dated February
      25, 2005, the arbitrator found in favour of GLP.  He found that although
      the 1989 Agreement was ambiguous as to whether PUC had a separate and perpetual
      right to renew the 5000 hp block, the 1998 Agreement resolved that ambiguity
      and made it clear that no such right to renew continued to exist. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>On
      the interpretation of the 1989 Agreement, the arbitrator found at para.
      51 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question to be addressed is whether the 1989
    agreement, and by extension the 1998 agreement, entirely apart from the question
    of waiver, was intended by the parties to renew the 5,000 horsepower block
    as provided for in the 1928 agreement, or to acknowledge the continued independent
    existence of the 1928 agreement as it applied to the 5,000 horsepower block.  If
    I was only interpreting the 1989 agreement, I would find ambiguity, because
    of the conflict between clause 1.0 which reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.0       <u>Term of Agreement</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.1        This Agreement shall commence on the
    first day of January, 1989, hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Commencement
    Date&quot; and, subject to paragraph 1.2 hereof, shall continue in force
    until December 31, 1998, unless earlier terminated in accordance with clauses
    5.5 [supply of power after termination deemed not to renew] or 5.7 [right
    to discontinue supply to safeguard life or property or for construction,
    etc.] or by mutual agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.2        In the event that power is supplied
    by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Great Lakes [GLP] to the Commission [PUC] after the expiration of the Term
    of this Agreement as defined above, the provisions of this Agreement shall
    continue in full force and effect until this Agreement is terminated by either
    party by giving written notice of such termination to the other party.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>and those clauses of the 1989 agreement which refer
    to the 1928 agreement as if still extant, including the second preamble,
    cl. 2.1 (a), cl. 5.2 and clauses 7.3 and 7.4. On the one hand, the 1928 agreement
    had not been renewed in accordance with its terms prior to the 1989 agreement,
    and the 1989 agreement provides for termination at the end of December 31,
    1998, with no renewal clause, together with the right to remove all its apparatus
    equipment and works at the end of the term, making it impossible to continue
    to supply power. On the other hand, the preamble and cl. 2.[1] (a), read
    with cl. 7.4, seem to acknowledge the continued existence of the 1928 agreement,
    at least with respect to the 5,000 horsepower block, and to allow for the
    existence of the 1989 agreement notwithstanding cl. 10 of the 1928 agreement,
    though the 1928 agreement expired by its terms in 1968, except for the 5,000
    horsepower block. There was no evidence of any objective surrounding circumstances
    or commercial context in the 1989 time frame that would shed light on the
    parties' intentions to clear up this ambiguity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
      arbitrator then considered whether the 1998 Agreement resolved the ambiguity
      in the 1989 Agreement.  Based on his interpretation of the 1998 Agreement,
      the arbitrator concluded at para. 54 of his reasons that the terms of the
      1928 Agreement that were incorporated by reference into the 1989 Agreement
      did not include the perpetual renewal provision: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Reading the preamble to the 1998 agreement makes
    it clear that the 1928 agreement had been
    “amended and extended” by the 1989 agreement, and when the parties recited
    that they desired “to further amend and extend the terms of the 1989 agreement”,
    they were incorporating into that extension and amendment the entire relationship
    between them, including what remained of the 1928 agreement.  That conclusion
    is reinforced by cl. 5, referring to “those terms of the 1928 agreement incorporated
    by reference therein” and by clauses 2.1(a) and 5.2 of the 1989 agreement,
    which had the effect of providing for the 5,000 horsepower block at the prices
    agreed to in 1928.  The circumstances make it clear that the terms of the
    1928 agreement that were incorporated in the 1989 agreement did not include
    the right of renewal.  In the economic climate that faced them in 1998, the
    parties were providing for the short term, with the hope, but not necessarily
    the expectation, that the relationship could continue beyond the 5 year fixed
    term they agreed to.  In 1989, they had provided for a 10 year term, but
    no right of renewal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Moreover,
      the arbitrator based his conclusion on the commercial sense of the situation,
      noting at para. 58 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The interpretation advocated by the PUC ... would
    leave, notwithstanding the termination of the relationship, the requirement
    for delivery by GLP of a very small fraction of the power requirements of
    Sault Ste. Marie, while at the same time making it impossible for GLP to
    exercise its contractual right to remove its equipment, works and apparatus
    from the city on termination. The continuation of the 5,000 horsepower block
    first agreed in 1928 made commercial sense as a benefit given to the PUC
    while GLP was the exclusive supplier of power to Sault Ste. Marie. It made

      appealed the arbitrator’s award to the Superior Court of Justice.  In reasons
      dated June 21, 2006, the appeal judge allowed PUC’s appeal and held that
      the perpetual renewal right remained extant.  As a result, he granted a
      declaration requiring GLP to sell the 5000 hp block to PUC in accordance
      with the rates specified in the 1928 Agreement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      the principles of contract interpretation, the appeal judge found that
      there was no ambiguity in the 1989 Agreement.  Rather, he held that the
      1989 Agreement included both a right to the 5000 hp block, as well as the
      perpetual right to renew that right.  The appeal judge provided the following
      reasons for his conclusion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[74]     The recital of the [1989 Agreement] contains
    the words &quot;is now under original contract bearing date February 8, 1928,&quot; which
    is the identical language found in the [1969 Agreement] and the [1979 Agreement].
    The recital, standing alone and supported by the contractual provisions that
    I will describe momentarily bring me to the conclusion that the parties intended
    that the [1928 Agreement] in so far as it dealt with the 5,000 units of energy
    continued to exist, notwithstanding that there is no evidence that PUC gave
    the formal written notice of renewal as required by the [1928 Agreement].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[75]     As a conceptual matter, I do not think
    it matters whether the un-renewed [1928 Agreement] was dead and revived by
    the [1989 Agreement] or whether the un-renewed [1928 Agreement] was incorporated
    by reference into the [1989 Agreement], the continued existence of the [1928
    Agreement] is in effect a promise or commitment made by the parties in the
    [1989 Agreement]. Conceptually, the [1928 Agreement] could exist as a separate
    contract or as an embedded contract within the [1989 Agreement]. The fundamental
    point is that the parties promised each other that GLP &quot;is now under
    the [1928 Agreement].&quot;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>The appeal judge noted that this conclusion was confirmed
      by the recitals and by clauses 2.1(a), 5.2(a), 7.3, and 7.4 of the 1989
      Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Having
      found the 1989 Agreement to be unambiguous, the appeal judge further concluded
      at para. 88 of his reasons that: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To the extent that the Arbitrator’s conclusion
    is an interpretation of the [1998 Agreement], I disagree with it.  In my
    opinion, properly interpreted, the [1998 Agreement] gave the parties the
    unilateral means to terminate the [1998 Agreement], but it did not give the
    parties the unilateral means to terminate their “relationship”.  In my opinion,
    the termination of the
    “relationship” would depend upon PUC releasing GLP from its obligation to
    supply the 5,000-unit block of energy, pursuant to the [1928 Agreement].</p>

      sole issue on appeal is whether the appeal judge erred in interpreting
      the agreements between the parties as leaving the perpetual renewal provision
      extant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>For
      the reasons set out below, we are of the view that the appeal judge erred
      in failing to give adequate weight to the fact that the 1928 Agreement
      lapsed in respect of the 5000 hp block in 1987, when PUC failed to deliver
      a timely notice of renewal.  Further, the appeal judge made several errors
      in his interpretation of the 1989 Agreement and 1998 Agreement in supporting
      his conclusion that the 1928 Agreement continued to exist with respect
      to the perpetual renewal provision.  As a result, his conclusion that that
      provision remained extant cannot stand.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>In
      construing the 1989 Agreement and 1998 Agreement as he did, the appeal
      judge failed to give adequate weight to the fact that the provision in
      the 1928 Agreement regarding the 5000 hp block lapsed entirely in 1987
      due to PUC’s failure to give the required renewal notice.  Thus, the perpetual
      renewal provision was no longer in effect when the parties entered into
      the 1989 Agreement.  Accordingly, the appeal judge’s reliance on the wording
      of the 1969 and 1979 agreements in construing the 1989 Agreement was misplaced,
      as the perpetual renewal provision was still in effect for those agreements.  As
      a result, in comparing the language of the 1969 and 1979 agreements to
      that of the 1989 Agreement and 1998 Agreement, the appeal judge was effectively
      comparing apples and oranges.  The intervening lapse of the 1928 Agreement
      in 1987 means that the 1969 and 1979 agreements cannot be equated with
      the later agreements for comparison purposes.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
      error becomes especially apparent in light of the unique and highly unusual
      nature of the perpetual renewal provision.  That provision enabled PUC
      to take advantage of favourable rates in perpetuity.  As such, it represented
      a significant benefit to PUC and an equally significant detriment to GLP.  In
      the circumstances, given the lapse of the perpetual renewal provision with
      respect to the 5000 hp block in 1987, we are of the view that if the parties
      intended to resurrect it, clear language was required.  No such language
      exists in either the 1989 Agreement or the 1998 Agreement. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>First,
      the appeal judge erred in his interpretation of clause 7.4 of the 1989
      Agreement, which amended paragraph 10 of the 1928 Agreement.  Paragraph
      10 provided that “this agreement shall constitute the sole and only contract
      dealing with the supply of electrical energy between the parties”.  However,
      clause 7.4 of the 1989 Agreement amended paragraph 10 of the 1928 Agreement
      as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Paragraph 10 of the original contract bearing date
    February 8, 1928, hereinbefore mentioned, is hereby amended to allow the
    existence of this present separate contract for the supply of additional
    power. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the
    mentioned Paragraph 10 of earlier contract shall in no way act to jeopardize
    or mitigate any of the provisions of this present contract.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The
      appeal judge relied heavily on this clause to conclude that all of the
      terms of the 1928 Agreement were incorporated into the later agreements,
      including the perpetual renewal provision, unless specifically altered
      by the later agreements.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>In
      our view, clause 7.4 of the 1989 Agreement cannot operate in the manner
      suggested by the appeal judge, given the unusual nature of the perpetual
      renewal provision and the fact that, to the knowledge of the parties, it
      had lapsed prior to the 1989 Agreement.  Rather, clause 7.4 can be explained
      by the fact that other provisions of the 1928 Agreement remained extant,
      and to the extent that those provisions were not altered, the parties intended
      that they be carried forward on the same terms.  For example, the definition
      provision in paragraph 2(e) of the 1928 Agreement would have been carried
      forward into the 1989 Agreement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Second,
      the appeal judge erred in his reliance on clause 7.3 of the 1989 Agreement
      in support of his conclusion.  Clause 7.3 maintained the existing rights
      of the parties under existing agreements.  Specifically, it provided:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is further understood and agreed that nothing
    herein contained, save and except for the sale, delivery and use of power,
    shall affect, abridge, alter or curtail any of the existing rights of the
    parties hereto under any existing agreement dealing in any way with the relations
    of the parties hereto or any rights, benefits, or privileges of either of
    the parties hereto under said agreements, particularly in regard to property
    rights under said agreements.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>In
      our view, because clause 7.3 refers to “existing rights” under an “existing
      agreement”, it does not support the appeal judge’s conclusion.  The 1928
      Agreement was no longer an “existing agreement” except insofar as some
      of its provisions, like the definition provision in paragraph 2(e), had
      been carried forward in the later agreements.  The perpetual renewal provision
      was not such a provision, hence it was not an “existing right”; rather,
      it was a right that had been extinguished.</span></p>

      we are of the view that the appeal judge erred in his reliance on clauses
      2.1(a) and 5.2(a) of the 1989 Agreement in support of his conclusion.  Clause
      2.1(a) provided:</span></p>

      our view, clauses 2.1(a) and 5.2(a) merely relate to the continued supply
      of the 5000 hp block and not to the perpetual renewal provision.  We note
      that in the 1928 Agreement, the perpetual renewal provision was clearly
      separated from the supply provision.  Accordingly, if the parties had intended
      to resurrect the perpetuity aspect of the 1928 Agreement, it should have
      been specifically referred to.  </span></p>

      at a critical point in his analysis, the appeal judge appears to have relied
      on a recital to the 1989 Agreement that references the 1928 Agreement as
      evidence of a mutual promise between the parties that the 1928 Agreement
      was alive.  This elevation of a recital to a mutual promise or operative
      provision was material to the interpretation reached by the appeal judge.  With
      respect, that approach was in error: see <i>Re McKellar</i>, [1972] 3 O.R.

      we note that PUC did not give the required notice of its intention to renew
      in 1997, as would have been required by the terms of the perpetual renewal
      provision in the 1928 Agreement.  This fact also belies the appeal judge’s
      interpretation that the perpetual renewal provision of the 1928 Agreement
      had been revived. </span></p>

      as a matter of practical concern, on the construction given to them by
      the appeal judge, the 1989 Agreement and 1998 Agreement are silent as to
      the timing of the notice required for any future renewal and/or the manner
      in which the right of renewal is to be exercised.  The absence of such
      important terms, particularly in a clause of this far-reaching nature,
      is in our view neither reasonable nor commercially sound.  This also supports
      our view that the parties did not intend to resurrect the perpetual renewal
