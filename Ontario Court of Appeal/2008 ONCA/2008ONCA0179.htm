  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was an experienced police officer.  K. was a young aboriginal woman pursuing her
    dream of becoming a police officer.  She
    met the appellant in 1989 during a high school co-op placement with the local
    police department where he worked.  The
    appellant took her under his wing.  She
    went on many “ride-alongs” with him.  He
    even let her drive his personal sports car.  He became her friend and mentor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1992, K. was at college.  While home one weekend, K. invited the
    appellant to her house.  He came
    over.  That night, the appellant raped
    her vaginally and anally.  He also
    demanded oral sex from her.  He made
    degrading comments to her and told her she “owed this” to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the event, the appellant was thirty nine
    years old and the victim was twenty-one years old.  The appellant had separated from his wife two
    weeks earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K. was devastated by the rape.  She disclosed what happened to a police
    officer a year later but did not formally report the matter until 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two-day judge-alone trial was straightforward.  The appellant said the sex was consensual; the
    complainant said that it was not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge unequivocally rejected the appellant’s
    evidence.  He accepted the complainant’s
    evidence.  The appellant was sentenced to
    four years’ imprisonment.  He appeals
    against conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    applying a stricter standard to the defence evidence, misapprehending the
    evidence, and misdirecting himself on the burden of proof.  He also submits that the trial judge erred in
    imposing a sentence of four years’ imprisonment.</p>
  <h3><u>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept that the trial judge applied a
    stricter standard to the evidence of the defence than to that of the
    Crown.  This was a straightforward case
    in which the sole issue was credibility.  The trial judge was entitled to accept the evidence of the complainant
    and reject that of the appellant.  Absent
    palpable and overriding error, deference must be shown to the findings of fact
    made at trial.  In the assessment of credibility,
    trial judges occupy a “singular perch”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s version of
    events and gave detailed reasons for doing so.  He did not simply choose between the two competing accounts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We acknowledge that the trial judge’s reasons for
    accepting the complainant’s evidence are extremely brief.  However, two points are to be made in that
    regard.  First, although he explains in
    only one paragraph why he accepts her evidence, that determination comes after
    a lengthy recitation of her evidence.  Second, there were no material inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence that required reconciliation.  In fact, only one matter could be described as an inconsistency and that
    was whether the complainant invited the appellant to her home in-person or over
    the phone.  (It was accepted by both
    parties that she had issued the invitation.)  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel, in closing submissions, did not
    suggest there were any material inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    testimony.  He described the complainant’s
    inability to recall whether, some thirteen years earlier, she saw the appellant
    and made the invitation or whether she had phoned him and invited him over, as
    a matter about which the complainant was “uncertain”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge did not hold the appellant to
    a higher standard because he was an experienced police officer.  His references to the fact that the appellant
    was a police officer at the time of the events were, in part, to explain why he
    disbelieved certain aspects of the appellant’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see nothing in the second ground of appeal.  This was a short trial and the judge
    extensively reviewed the evidence in the first thirty pages of his reasons,
    without error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the third issue, as the Crown acknowledged, the
    trial judge did misstate the third limb of the <i>W.D</i>. test: <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  However, we are satisfied on a reading of the
    reasons as a whole that the trial judge properly followed the dictates of <i>W.(D.).  </i>His misstatement did not result in a subtle shift in the onus of
    proof.  This was a very experienced trial
    judge, who is presumed to know the law.  He extensively reviewed all the evidence presented to him.  He did not believe the appellant’s
    evidence.  The defence evidence as a
    whole, including that of Dan Blake (a general contractor and friend of the
    appellant who gave evidence on behalf of the defence) did not raise a
    reasonable doubt in his mind.  He
    accepted the evidence of the complainant.  Based on the whole of the evidence, he was convinced beyond a reasonable
    doubt of the appellant’s guilt.  While
    his articulation of the third limb was over-brief and resulted in a
    misstatement, we are satisfied that it was nothing more than that.  As the Supreme Court of Canada recently made
    clear in <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i>, 2008 SCC 2,
    what is critical is whether the correct burden and standard of proof were
    applied.  We are satisfied that the trial
    judge made no error in respect of either.     </p>
  <h3><u>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    treating the appellant’s “fabricated” evidence as an aggravating factor.  We agree.  In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated (at p. 23):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Also a further
    aggravating factor in my view is that the offender lied and fabricated his
    evidence as I found it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that this error is mitigated by the
    trial judge’s later statement that denial of guilt is not an aggravating
    factor.  We do not accept this
    submission.  The two statements relate to
    different matters.  The latter is the
    express recognition that an accused person is entitled to maintain his
    innocence.  The former relates to the
    manner in which the defence is presented.  Neither can be treated as aggravating factors for the purposes of
    sentencing for the reasons given by this court in <i>R. v. Kozy</i> (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 500 at 506:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Just as an accused
    should never apprehend that a penalty will flow from a plea of not guilty,
    there should also be no perceived impingement upon the manner of presenting the
    defence.  This is so whether it be counsel’s
    viciousness in attacking a complainant or lies told by the accused.  The latter may lead to its own penalty on a
    trial and conviction for perjury, but within the trial for the offence of
    sexual assault both rank as tactics for the defence, however ill-conceived, and
    they are embraced within the right to full answer and defence … .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent from the reasons that the trial judge
    increased the sentence because of the appellant’s untruthful evidence at
    trial.  As that was a clear error, it
    falls to this court to establish a fit sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the Crown’s submission that, in the
    circumstances, the appropriate range of sentence was three to five years.  Without in any way diminishing the
    devastating impact the assault had on the complainant, we find that, in the
    circumstances, a sentence at the low end of the range is fit.  The conviction was for a single count of
    sexual assault.  There was no violence
    apart from that which is inherent in such an offence.  The offence had occurred many years prior to
    trial and the appellant, a man in his early fifties, had no prior criminal
    record.  In addition, there was much
    evidence on his otherwise unblemished character and positive role as a father,
    especially to his two youngest children.</p>
  <h3><u>DISPOSITION</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is
    dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is
    granted, that appeal is allowed and the sentence is varied to three years’
    imprisonment, all other aspects of the sentence to remain the same.</p>
