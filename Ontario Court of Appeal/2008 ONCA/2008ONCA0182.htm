line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises important issues regarding the law of contempt and
    its application to a journalist who, subpoenaed to testify at a civil trial,
    refuses to answer questions that would reveal a confidential source. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Kenneth Peters was a municipal affairs reporter with <i>The</i> <i>Hamilton Spectator</i>.  He wrote a series of three articles, published in
    April 1995, detailing various complaints and investigations by municipal
    authorities concerning health and safety practices at the plaintiff’s lodging
    home for senior citizens.  The appellant obtained documents from a confidential
    source who provided the key information for the three articles.  The articles
    prompted the plaintiff to sue the defendant municipalities and municipal
    officials for various causes of action, including defamation, negligence, and
    abuse of public office for releasing confidential documents to the media. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff subpoenaed the appellant to testify at the trial of the
    action and the subpoena directed the appellant to bring all documents and
    records relating to the three newspaper articles.  The identity of the
    appellant’s confidential source had obvious relevance to the plaintiff’s claim
    that the defendant municipalities had leaked the documents to the media.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Motion to
    Quash the Subpoena</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that it would
    require the disclosure of journalist work product, in violation of the
    appellant’s common law and s. 2(b) <i>Charter</i> rights.  The trial judge
    ruled that the protection of news sources was “a very important principle and
    deserving of court recognition and, on a case by case basis, worthy of
    protection.”  He suggested that the appellant’s concerns might be resolved if
    the question was limited to whether any of the appellant’s sources were employees
    of the defendants.  The appellant declined to accept that suggestion.  In the
    end, the trial judge dismissed the motion to quash the subpoena on the grounds
    that the appellant’s evidence as to the source of the documents was relevant
    and necessary to dispose of the case, and that the plaintiff had exhausted all
    reasonable means to obtain the information elsewhere. In the trial judge’s
    view, the fair trial rights of the plaintiff therefore outweighed the
    appellant’s claim of media privilege. No appeal is taken from that order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge directed that the examination of the appellant should
    proceed in three stages that he would closely monitor:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the appellant would be questioned as to whether he gave an
    undertaking to obtain the subject information and as to what documents he
    received;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the court would permit examination pertaining to
    “evidence of communication of the defendants’ employees with the <i>Spectator </i>…
    excluding evidence that pertains to [the appellant’s] source”;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge reserved the third stage, stating that its
    character would depend “on the determination of the first and second stages.”</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Appellant’s
    Evidence at Trial</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified immediately after the trial judge dismissed the
    motion to quash the subpoena.  The appellant disclosed that when A, his
    confidential source, gave him the documents, another individual B was present.  The
    appellant had given an undertaking of confidentiality to A but not to B.  The
    appellant was asked to identify B. He refused to do so, explaining that
    identifying B would inevitably lead to identifying A. The trial judge initially
    suggested that plaintiff’s counsel avoid the question of B’s identity but
    counsel persisted in asking the appellant to identify B.  The trial judge found
    that it could well be “that naming B will cause an inquiry to B and B may name
    A.”  He ruled, however, that the appellant should answer on the ground that no
    undertaking of confidentiality had been given to B nor had the appellant
    undertaken to A that he would not reveal B’s identity.  The appellant refused
    to answer the question: “With all due respect, Your Honour, I can’t do that.” </p>

    immediately asked the appellant’s counsel: “Is there any reason why Mr. Peters
    should not be held in contempt of this Court?”  The trial judge again rejected
    the appellant’s submission that he should not be required to identify B as doing
    so could have the effect of identifying A: “I do not do this lightly.  To my
    mind the question should be answered—it is contempt—and I have directed him to
    answer it.”  The show cause hearing was scheduled for the next week.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One day before the show cause hearing, the <i>Spectator</i> published an
    article in which a city council member was quoted as stating that he knew A’s
    identity.  The show cause hearing was adjourned and eventually Henry Merling, a
    former city alderman, came forward and testified that he was the appellant’s
    confidential source and that he now released the appellant from his
    undertaking.  Mr. Merling also identified B as David Wilson.  However, when Mr.
    Wilson testified, he denied being present during or aware of the exchange of
    the confidential documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge directed that the appellant complete his evidence the
    next sitting day and that the show cause hearing immediately follow.  The trial
    judge stated that it would be “very relevant” if the appellant sought to purge
    his contempt when he testified. The trial judge acknowledged that “it appears
    at this point that there is not an issue going forward,” that the appellant and
    the court were not “at loggerheads”, and that “developments since [the
    appellant’s refusal to answer] have a major bearing on where we are going with
    this.”  He also stated, however, that the proceedings were for criminal
    contempt in the face of the court.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Show
    Cause Hearing</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next sitting day, Merling’s evidence was completed and the trial
    judge ruled that in the absence of any evidence that Merling was not the
    source, no further evidence was required from the appellant and his subpoena
    was terminated.  The show cause hearing then commenced.  The trial judge stated
    that he accepted that the appellant was “an honourable man, doing his job as a
    journalist as he honestly believes it should be done” and that he had been “at
    all times respectful, indeed polite to the Court and counsel.”  However, the
    trial judge expressed his concern over the appellant’s refusal to answer what
    had been ruled to be a proper question, thereby presenting “defiance to the
    authority of the Superior Court and an obstruction to the administration of
    justice.”  The trial judge added: “No one in Canada is above the law. Mr.
    Peters’ conduct cannot be passed off.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the nature of appellant’s conduct and the fact that the
    required information had been obtained, the trial judge indicated that the
    matter would now proceed as a civil rather than criminal contempt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant’s counsel indicated that he had prepared his case on the basis
    that the appellant would be given a further opportunity to testify before the
    show cause hearing and on the basis that the hearing was to be for criminal
    rather than civil contempt.  The matter was adjourned for one day to allow
    counsel to prepare his submissions in light of the changed circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the show cause hearing, the appellant explained that Merling gave him
    the documents on the basis that “they did not come from him.”  The appellant
    regarded the documents as “explosive” and discussed the confidentiality
    undertaking with his editor who concluded that given the nature of the
    documents, the confidentiality undertaking was appropriate.  The appellant
    testified that when he was asked to disclose B’s identity, he was convinced
    that doing so would have the effect of disclosing A’s identity as well. He
    further explained that to answer the question would effectively end his career
    as a journalist.  He testified that after being cited for contempt, he
    approached Merling, who initially insisted that confidentiality be maintained
    but eventually agreed that the appellant could reveal that his source was a
    city employee.  The next day, Merling came forward and identified himself as
    the appellant’s source. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s editor, Dana Robbins, testified as to the undertaking of
    confidentiality given in this case and the importance of confidential sources to
    the practice of news gathering in general.  He stated that if confidential
    sources knew “they ran a very real risk of being ‘outed’ at some point down the
    road … many of our sources would dry up” and that this would undermine “the
    service we do every day in trying to keep the public informed.”  Vincent
    Carlin, a veteran journalist and associate professor of journalism at Ryerson,
    was qualified as an expert witness.  Carlin explained the importance of
    confidential sources as “the lifeblood” of the media’s watchdog function and
    that if journalists did not maintain confidentiality and protect their sources,
    the sources would “dry up.”  Carlin testified that in his opinion, after the
    court had directed the appellant to answer the question about B’s identity, the
    appellant and his editor had observed the standards of responsible journalism
    and taken appropriate steps to see whether there was some other way to deal
    with the problem.  He stated that a “chilling message” would be sent by
    punishing a journalist who had followed “the normal guidelines of his craft”, who
    had done “his best to avoid the confrontation”, and who was involved in a case where
    the required information had come out in some other way.</p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither party to the action sought a finding of contempt or made

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge ruled that “respect for the <i>Charter</i> values of
    freedom of expression and of the press” had led him to “[m]ake all reasonable
    efforts to avoid a direct confrontation” with the appellant, namely by offering
    to allow the appellant to identify his unnamed source as a city employee or to
    identify a witness to the transaction who was not a confidential source.  The
    appellant had chosen not to answer and that amounted to contempt of court.  The
    fact that there had been no ruling requiring the appellant to disclose his
    confidential source and the fact that the appellant had gone to the source to
    discuss the undertaking were mitigating factors.  The trial judge found that
    the “culture of the newsroom” was that journalists had “to break the law and
    endure the punishment.” He described this culture as “oppressive” and found
    that it had caused the appellant great turmoil by presenting him with a choice
    between a career-ending decision and possibly being sentenced to a lengthy term
    of imprisonment.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The
    plaintiff was being denied the opportunity to attempt to prove a vital element

    the appellant and invited submissions on the appropriateness of an order that
    the appellant pay the parties costs for matters flowing from his refusal to
    answer. </p>

    confidentiality to his or her source.  In exchange for giving the information,
    the confidential source gains the right to insist that the journalist maintain
    confidentiality. However, a right of confidentiality, by itself, is not sufficient
    to protect against compelled disclosure should the confidential information be
    required in a court of law or other legal proceeding.</p>

    between solicitor and client—the public interest in protecting the integrity of
    the relationship is so strong that the common law provides for a blanket or
    class privilege that shields all confidential information from disclosure.  However,
    for most relationships—doctor-patient, priest-penitent,
    journalist-informant—the interest in confidentiality must be balanced against
    the interest in the proper administration of justice, and claims to privilege
    are resolved on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    confidentiality.  The media has a vital role in gathering and disseminating
    information in a free and democratic society and, as the Supreme Court of
    Canada held in <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. New Brunswick (Attorney

    the media from gathering that information, and from disseminating it to the

    that journalist-informant confidentiality is important for effective news
    gathering.  In <i>Canadian Broadcast Corporation v. Lessard</i>, [1991] 3

    recognized that the “[p]rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic
    conditions for press freedom” and that if sources are not protected from
    disclosure, they “may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the
    public on matters of public interest.”  The result, according to the court,
    would be that “the vital public watchdog role of the press may be undermined

    journalist-informant confidentiality and the proper application of the law of

    constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of expression and freedom of the
    media.  I fail to see any reason to ignore this vital component of the
    appellant’s case that informs the procedural rights to which he is entitled.  In
    my view, there can be no doubt that when applying the four-part Wigmore test to
    journalist-informant confidentiality and assessing the weight to be given to
    protecting confidentiality, courts must take into account relevant <i>Charter</i> values, even though the <i>Charter</i> does not directly apply: see <i>R.W.D.S.U.,

    ground that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that disclosing
    the identity of the source would have a “chilling effect” on journalists’
    sources and the gathering of news.  As I have noted, there was some evidence to
    this effect provided at the show cause hearing by the appellant’s editor and

    empirical evidence.  They instead employ their judgment as to the likely impact
    rules will have on human behaviour, particularly where the issue is encouraging
    the free flow of information.  The “chilling effect” of the common law of
    defamation has been recognized by this court and other courts around the common
    law world without empirical evidence: see <i>Cusson v. Quan </i>(2007), 87 O.R.
    (3d) 241 (C.A.) at para. 83.  The entire law of solicitor-client privilege is
    built upon the empirically unproven yet surely sound judgment that a client not
    given an iron-clad guarantee of confidentiality will tend to be unwilling to
    disclose all the relevant facts to his or her lawyer and will therefore be unable
    to secure proper legal advice: <i>R. v. McClure, supra</i> at para. 33.  The
    rule that jury deliberations must remain secret is based upon the empirically
    unproven yet surely sound judgment that confidentiality promotes among jurors
    candour, full and frank debate, and the free exchange of all views without fear
    of exposure to public ridicule: see <i>R. v. Pan; R. v. Sawyer,</i> [2001] 2
    S.C.R. 344 at para. 50.  Informer privilege rests upon the empirically unproven
    yet surely sound judgment that its protection “encourages cooperation with the
    criminal justice system for future potential informers”: <i>Named Person v.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact is that
    information which should be placed in the public domain is frequently made

    identity will not be disclosed makes a significant contribution to the ability
    of the press to perform their role in society of making information available
    to the public.  It is for this reason that it is well established now that the

    the question of whether a journalist could be compelled to testify before the
    Alberta Labour Relations Board.  While the journalist raised the issue of
    confidential sources, it is clear from Sopinka J.’s judgment, at p. 1579, that
    the primary focus of the questions related to <i>information</i> <i>the
    journalist gave to company officials</i>. Sopinka J. held that the appeal could
    be resolved without dealing with the broad constitutional question of the
    protection of confidential sources under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  It was
    in that context that Sopinka J. stated that evidence would be required to
    demonstrate “that compelling journalists to testify before bodies such as the

    should resort to citations for contempt in the face of the court only as a last

    at pp.&nbsp;35-6, the Canadian Judicial Council admonishes judges to use the
    power to cite for contempt in the face of the court only as a last resort.  The <i>Guidelines</i> do not address journalist-informant confidentiality, but they
    do specifically address, at p. 37, the difficult issue of the witness who
    refuses to testify or to answer proper questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Probably
    the most difficult question of contempt that is likely to arise in the course
    of a trial is the witness who refuses to be sworn or to testify.  Often they
    are persons who subjectively may have a very good reason not to give evidence.  There
    is no doubt, in view of <i><span style='font-family:"TimesNewRoman\,Italic"'>Vaillancourt</span></i> [<i><span style='font-family:"TimesNewRoman\,Italic"'>R</span></i>. v. <i><span
style='font-family:"TimesNewRoman\,Italic"'>Vaillancourt</span></i>, [1981] 1
    S.C.R. 69], that the refusal of a witness to give evidence is a criminal
    contempt.  A judge dealing with such a problem must be firm, particularly if
    the evidence is important to one party or another and the reluctant witness
    must be made to understand that he or she must answer all proper questions.  If
    the witness refuses or pretends not to know the answer, he or she may be taken
    into custody or otherwise be given an opportunity to consider his or her
    position.  <i>This can be done one or more times without making a finding of
    contempt, but eventually it may be necessary to allege contempt and to conduct
    a hearing if the party seeking the evidence will not withdraw.  Sentencing
    should be put off, if possible, to the end of the trial (if it is not too long
    a trial), and the contemnor may be released or kept in custody as circumstances
    may require. </i>[Emphasis added]</p>

    where journalist-informant confidentiality is at stake.  As Saunders J. put it
    in <i>Crown Trust Co. v. Rosenberg</i>, [1983] O.J. No. 511 (H.C.J.) at para. 6,
    the court should take steps to respect journalist-informant confidentiality “as
    much as possible.” A rigid or categorical approach is to be avoided.  A court
    should instead prefer to “proceed carefully and in a step-by-step fashion … in
    the interest of preserving the confidentiality of the sources if it is at all
    possible to do so”: <i>id. </i>at para. 7.</p>

    Precipitous resort to the contempt power may be in the end counter-productive.  By
    raising the stakes and presenting the journalist with an immediate
    all-or-nothing choice, there is a risk that the court’s actions will foreclose
    the exploration of alternative means of securing the information.  This does
    not assist the litigant who seeks the information and runs the risk of making a
    martyr of the defiant journalist, all to the detriment of the integrity of the

    restricting freedom of expression and freedom of the press. <i>Re Vancouver Sun</i>,
    [2004] 2 S.C.R. 332 at para. 31, holds that the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test is
    “equally applicable to all discretionary actions by a trial judge to limit freedom
    of expression by the press during judicial proceedings.”  <i>Toronto Star
    Newspapers Ltd. v. Ontario</i> (2005), 197 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 7,
    similarly holds that the test “applies to all discretionary court orders that
    limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press in relation to legal
    proceedings.”</p>

    should not apply to the matter of journalist-informant confidentiality.  I note
    that several trial courts have reached the same conclusion.  In <i>Fullowka v.
    Royal Oak Mines Inc.</i>, 2001 NWTSC 4 at para. 48, after reviewing the
    pertinent case law, Vertes J. identified “three broad propositions: first, the
    media occupies a special position before the courts; second, the exercise of a
    discretion, whether it is based on a common law or statutory power, must be
    exercised in accordance with <i>Charter</i> values; and third, there must be a
    balancing of interests done within a contextual framework.”  Similarly, in <i><span

lang=EN style='color:black'>, </span><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>[1998]

    accused sought the production of a journalist’s notes, Romilly J. held at para.
    60 </span>“<span lang=EN style='color:black'>that where members of the media
    are called to give evidence, it is incumbent upon courts to balance the necessity
    of having the evidence before the court against the special position and role
    of the media as recognized by s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>” in accordance with <i>Dagenais</i>. Romilly J. identified, at para. 66, the need to consider, <i>inter
    alia</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>whether the evidence is available

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>whether

line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge struck the right note in his initial ruling on the
    motion to quash the subpoena. At that point, he recognized the need to proceed
    incrementally.  Unfortunately, he appears to have lost sight of that important
    principle as the matter proceeded to the point at which he directed the
    appellant to identify B, the alleged witness to the handover of the documents
    by the appellant’s confidential source.  In my respectful view, the trial
    judge’s use of the contempt power in the case at bar failed to comply with the
    principles that arise under both the common law of contempt and under the <i>Dagenais</i>/<i>Mentuck</i> test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I have already stated, before citing the appellant for
    contempt, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to make an express ruling on
    the claim for privilege under the Wigmore test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, and assuming that the trial judge would have rejected the claim
    of privilege, before invoking the full force of the law of contempt and putting
    the integrity of the court on the line, the trial judge should have given the appellant
    and the parties an opportunity to explore other avenues that could produce the
    desired information.  At a minimum, the appellant should have been afforded the
    opportunity to consider his position in light of the fact that he had been
    ordered to disclose the confidential information.  The appellant also should
    have been given the opportunity to consult with the confidential source to
    determine whether, in light of the court’s order, the source still insisted
    that the confidentiality be maintained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have noted, the confidential source came forward and disclosed his
    identity. That almost certainly would have occurred even if the appellant only
    faced an order to answer and the threat of contempt proceedings if he did not.  Had
    the trial judge taken a more restrained approach, the desired information would
    have been obtained and the entire issue of contempt could have been avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me, therefore, that the preferable course would have been to
    postpone the contempt hearing until the conclusion of the trial.  This would
    maintain the force of the order that the witness answer, but leave the ultimate
    sanction of contempt to be dealt with at the end of the case when the impact,
    if any, of the witness’s refusal was clear.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>2.         Did the trial judge err by
    finding the appellant in contempt after the confidential source had been
    revealed?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can see no justification for continuing with the contempt proceedings
    once the required evidence had been provided to the court.  The appellant had
    remained polite and cooperative at all times.  He had declined to answer out of
    a <i>bona fide</i> conviction that his promise of confidentiality and the
    ethics of his profession required him to take that position.  The information
    having been provided to the court, the demands of the judicial system had been
    met.  The problem posed by the appellant’s refusal to answer was not defiance
    of the court’s authority but how best to find a way to get the evidence the
    court needed to decide the case.  The trial judge partially recognized this by
    converting a criminal proceeding for contempt in the face of the court into a
    proceeding for civil contempt.  Civil contempt is coercive rather than punitive
    in nature.  It is essentially a matter as between the parties and is aimed at
    enforcing the court’s orders for the benefit of the party in whose favour the
    order was made.  Here, neither party initiated proceedings for contempt.  As
    the evidence had been provided, there was no reason to enforce the order
    requiring the appellant to identify B and it is difficult to see why it was
    necessary to continue with any contempt proceedings, whether civil or criminal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>3.         Did the trial judge undermine
    the appellant’s procedural rights on the show cause hearing?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By changing the rules for the show cause hearing at the last moment, and
    refusing to allow the appellant to testify any further at the trial proper, the
    trial judge deprived the appellant of the opportunity to purge his contempt.  This
    was compounded by the last-minute change from criminal to civil contempt, a
    move undoubtedly prompted by the trial judge’s appreciation of mitigating
    factors favouring the appellant, yet a move that caught the appellant by
    surprise and compounded his difficulties in responding to the citation for
    contempt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was inappropriate in the circumstances of this case for
    the trial judge to initiate contempt proceedings on his own, whether civil or
    criminal.  This was not a situation of open defiance of a court order requiring
    an immediate sanction to uphold the court’s integrity.  Moreover, as the
    Canadian Judicial Council suggests in its <i>Guidelines</i>, <i>supra </i>at
    21, “[i]n most cases, it will be the wise course for the judge to leave the
    initiation of proceedings to the parties or to the Attorney General.”</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span

    assuming that it was open to the court to make a costs award against him, the penalty
    imposed by the trial judge, measured by the costs to the parties to the
    litigation, was excessive in the circumstances.  As I have already mentioned,
    the trial judge proceeded on the basis of civil, not criminal contempt and recognized
    that the appellant was respectful and his conduct was motivated by a genuine
    belief in the need to protect his source.  The parties did not initiate
    contempt proceedings nor did they take any position on whether the appellant
    should be found in contempt.  The evidence they needed had been provided and no
    sanction was required to ensure compliance with the court’s order.  In these
    circumstances, there was no justification for the imposition of a substantial
    penalty and the appellant should not have been ordered to pay over $30,000 in
    costs.</p>
