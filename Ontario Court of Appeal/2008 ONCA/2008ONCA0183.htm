  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent (plaintiff), J.S.M. Corporation (Ontario) Ltd. (“J.S.M.”),
    owned a large commercial property in Windsor, Ontario known as Gateway Plaza.  In August 1986, it agreed to lease 29,000 square feet of the Gateway Plaza to the Brick Furniture Warehouse Ltd. (“Brick Ltd.”).  The lease was for a
    ten-year term with two five-year renewals available at the option of Brick Ltd. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brick Ltd. was one of a number of corporate entities that together made
    up the Brick enterprise.  That enterprise operated a number of very successful
    retail stores across Canada.  The stores sold home furnishings and electronic
    products.  The corporate entities that made up the Brick enterprise were
    controlled by the same group of persons headed by Mr. William Comrie, the principal
    owner and driving force behind the Brick enterprise.  The companies did not
    operate at arms length from each other.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 1996, the Brick enterprise (operating through a corporate
    entity known as Brick Corp. #3) exercised the first of the two five-year
    options available under the lease.  After the option was exercised, the lease
    was in effect until September 2001.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In February 2000, the Brick enterprise notified J.S.M. that it would cease
    to operate its store at the Gateway Plaza.  The Brick enterprise planned to
    open a new larger store in another location in Windsor.  The Brick store in the
    Gateway Plaza closed at the end of March 2000, some eighteen months before
    the expiry of the lease.  The lease required that the tenant operate a store
    throughout the term of the lease. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. commenced an action against Brick Ltd. and Brick Warehouse (Windsor) Ltd. (“Brick Windsor”), the latter having taken an assignment of the tenant’s
    interest in the lease.  Both companies had direct obligations to J.S.M. under
    the lease and a related assignment.  Their liability to J.S.M. was not
    challenged.  The trial judge found those companies liable for the unpaid rent under
    the lease and the assignment agreement (para. 52).  This finding was, however,
    of no real value to J.S.M. because neither company had ever had any assets
    other than the lease.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. also claimed against Brick Warehouse Corporation (Brick Corp.),
    which had taken an assignment of a sublease to the premises.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">*</a></span> 
    Brick Corp. did have substantial assets.  Brick Corp. took the position that it
    had no obligation to J.S.M.  From the corporate perspective, this litigation was
    all about Brick Corp.’s liability for the rent owing to J.S.M. under the lease.
     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. also sued Mr. Comrie and other directors and officers of the
    Brick enterprise personally.  Those claims were dismissed at trial and a
    cross-appeal from that dismissal was abandoned prior to oral argument.  I need
    say no more about those claims.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, J.S.M. claimed that Brick Corp. was liable:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For breach of a contract entered into with J.S.M. in June 1987;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the oppression remedy provision remedies of the Alberta<i> Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.A. 2000, c. B-9 and the <i>Canada Business
    Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44; and</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In tort for inducing a breach of the lease and for intentional
    interference with J.S.M.’s economic relations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that there was a contractual relationship among
    J.S.M., Brick Windsor and Brick Corp., but that the terms of the contract did
    not give J.S.M. any right to recover the unpaid rent from Brick Corp.  He
    dismissed the contract claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave J.S.M. “complainant” status under the oppression
    remedy provisions.  He went on to hold that the corporate affairs of Brick
    Windsor and Brick Corp. had been carried out in a manner that was oppressive to
    the interests of J.S.M.  The trial judge further concluded that the appropriate
    remedy for the oppressive conduct was an order requiring Brick Corp. to pay
    damages to J.S.M. equal to the rent owing under the unexpired portion of the
    lease (April 1, 2000-September 2001).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found Brick Corp. liable under the oppression remedy provisions,
    the trial judge did not address Brick Corp.’s potential liability in tort.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. had also sought leave under s. 240(1) of the Alberta<i> Business
    Corporations Act</i> to commence a derivative action on behalf of Brick Windsor
    against Brick Corp.  The trial judge granted leave.  The derivative action is,
    however, of no consequence unless J.S.M. cannot recover directly against Brick
    Corp.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellants submit that J.S.M. could not as a matter of
    law qualify as a complainant for the purposes of the oppression remedy.  The
    appellants further argue that even if J.S.M. could so qualify, the trial judge
    erred in granting J.S.M. that status in the circumstances of this case.  The
    appellants argue that the lease and subsequent agreements between J.S.M. and
    the Brick enterprise are the result of arms length negotiations between two
    sophisticated commercial parties.  The appellants contend that J.S.M.’s only
    reasonable expectation could be that its rights and remedies were those that
    arose from the agreements.  On the appellants’ interpretation of those agreements,
    J.S.M. had agreed to look to Brick Ltd. and Brick Windsor should there be any
    breach of the lease or the sublease.  The appellants contend that the fact that
    neither entity had any assets, particularly given J.S.M.’s failure to conduct
    any due diligence inquiries before entering into the agreements, cannot alter
    the substance of the agreements or give J.S.M. a reasonable expectation to look
    to a non-party to the agreement for recovery of any unpaid rent. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that in granting an oppression remedy, the trial
    judge effectively rewrote the contracts describing the relationship between
    J.S.M. and the various corporate entities within the Brick enterprise.  The
    appellants contend that in so doing, the trial judge gave J.S.M. access to
    Brick Corp.’s wallet.  The appellants submit that J.S.M. had not bargained for
    that access and in all likelihood could not have obtained that access through arms
    length bargaining with the Brick enterprise.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent contends that the trial judge properly
    invoked the oppression remedy to grant relief against Brick Corp. in the form
    of damages equal to the unpaid rent under the lease.  In the alternative,
    counsel submits that J.S.M. was entitled to recover the unpaid rent under the
    contract to which it and Brick Corp. were both parties.  Finally, and in the
    further alternative, counsel submits that J.S.M. was entitled to recover
    against Brick Corp. in tort either on the basis that it induced Brick Windsor
    to breach the lease agreement with J.S.M., or on the basis that it wrongfully interfered
    with J.S.M.’s economic relations with Brick Windsor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  I think that J.S.M. was entitled to recover
    the unpaid rent under the agreement it had with Brick Corp.  While it is
    unnecessary to decide J.S.M.’s entitlement to recover under the oppression
    remedy provisions, I will address that issue at the end of these reasons.  I
    will not consider the tort claims.</p>

  <h4>THE RELEVANT TRANSACTIONS </h4>
  <p class=MsoHeader style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>          (i)  The Head Lease</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. entered into the lease with Brick Ltd. in August 1986.  Under the
    terms of the lease, Brick Ltd. agreed to operate a retail sales business on the
    leased premises and further agreed that it would not vacate the premises during
    the term of the lease.  The lease had a ten-year term with two five-year
    renewal options available to the tenant.  The lease did not contain any early
    termination provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the subsequent transactions, para. 7.03.2 of the lease, which
    addresses assignments and sub-leases, is important.  It reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The Tenant
    will not, and will not permit, a sub-tenant to assign this Lease in whole or in
    part, or sublet all or part of the Leased Premises, and will not permit the
    occupation or use of all or part thereof by others without the prior written
    consent of the Landlord in each case, which consent will not be unreasonably
    withheld</u> …  The consent by the Landlord to an assignment or subletting will
    not constitute a waiver of its consent to a subsequent assignment or
    subletting.  This prohibition against assignment or subletting includes a
    prohibition against an assignment or subletting by operation of law.  If this Lease
    is assigned, or if all or part of the Leased Premises is sublet or occupied by
    anybody other than the Tenant, in any case without the consent of the landlord
    when required, the Landlord may collect the rent from the assignee, sub-tenant
    or occupant and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved. 
    Despite an assignment, the Tenant will remain fully liable under this Lease.  <u>The
    [T]enant may sublet the premises to its parent, subsidiary or affiliated
    company with notice but without consent</u> …  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this term, Brick Ltd. could not assign the lease without the
    written consent of J.S.M.  Also, Brick Ltd. could not permit a sub-tenant to
    assign the lease without the written consent of J.S.M.  The same prohibition
    applied with respect to subletting the leased premises except that Brick Ltd. could
    sublet to another Brick company without J.S.M.’s consent provided J.S.M. was
    notified.  Finally, under this term, Brick Ltd. could not allow the leased
    premises to be occupied or used by anyone else without the written consent of
    J.S.M.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brick Ltd. had no assets other than the lease.  Mr. Comrie testified that
    when the Brick enterprise was renting property for a retail store, it would use
    a shell corporation to act as the tenant.  If the store’s business flourished,
    the Brick enterprise and the landlord would both profit.  If the store failed, the
    Brick enterprise and the landlord would both suffer – the Brick enterprise
    because its business failed, and the landlord because it had no effective
    recourse against the shell corporation for non-payment of rent.  The trial
    judge observed that this approach “makes good business sense and is consistent
    with freedom of contract in commercial relationships” (at para. 61).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. took no steps to inquire into Brick Ltd.’s financial means or its
    ability to meet its obligations under the lease.  J.S.M. did not request the covenant
    of any individual or corporate entity other than Brick Ltd. on the lease. 
    Under the terms of the lease, J.S.M. could reasonably expect to look only to
    Brick Ltd. for recovery should the terms of the lease be breached.</p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Brick store opened in the Gateway Plaza in November 1986.  By all

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In early January 1987, the Ontario solicitors for the Brick enterprise
    were instructed to prepare an assignment and a sublease.  By assignment
    effective April 1, 1987, Brick Ltd. assigned its interest as a tenant in the
    head lease to Brick Windsor.  As required under the head lease, Brick Ltd. notified
    J.S.M. of this assignment and obtained its written consent to the assignment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the agreement made among Brick Ltd., Brick Windsor
    and J.S.M., Brick Windsor, the assignee of the lease, agreed directly with
    J.S.M. to perform all of the tenant’s obligations under the lease.  Brick Windsor had no assets when it entered into this agreement.  J.S.M. did not make any
    inquiries as to Brick Windsor’s assets or its financial viability.  In the same
    agreement, Brick Ltd., the original tenant and now the assignor of the lease,
    agreed to remain bound under the terms of the lease to J.S.M.    Pursuant to
    this agreement, J.S.M. could reasonably expect that in the event of a breach of
    its lease, it could look to Brick Ltd. and/or Brick Windsor for recovery.</p>

    the tenant’s role under its assignment, sublet the leased premises to yet
    another Brick company, the Brick Warehouse Ltd. (“Brick Warehouse”).  Under the
    terms of the sublease, Brick Windsor agreed to sublease the premises “for the
    term of the lease including renewal periods”.  Brick Warehouse, as sub-tenant,
    undertook to pay to Brick Windsor all amounts and charges payable under the
    head lease.  Brick Warehouse also agreed to abide by all of the sub-landlord’s
    covenants, obligations and agreements under the head lease.  No term in the
    sublease provided for early termination of the sublease.  Like the head lease,
    the sublease was for ten years with two five year renewal options exercisable
    at the sub-tenant’s option.</p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. was not a party to the sublease.  As required under the head
    lease, however, J.S.M. was notified of the sublease.  Its consent was not
    required because Brick Warehouse and Brick Windsor were affiliated companies.  Like
    the head lease, the sublease provided to J.S.M. did not contain any early
    termination provisions and required the sub-tenant to operate a retail sales
    business on the rented premises for the duration of the lease.  Additionally,
    the sublease provided for payment of the same rent as the head lease.  Finally,
    in its notification letter, the Brick enterprise did not indicate that the
    terms of the lease differed from those of the head lease in any material
    respect.</p>

    J.S.M.’s consent to the assignment.  Counsel advised that the assignment and
    transfer of the business conducted on the leased premises to Brick Corp. were
    part of a “going public” strategy by the Brick enterprise.  There was no

    indicated that the sublease entered into between Brick Windsor and Brick
    Warehouse and now assigned to Brick Corp. should have contained an early
    termination clause.  A new sublease agreement was drawn in March 1988 bearing
    the date April 1, 1987.  The preamble of the new sublease indicated that certain
    terms had been omitted by inadvertence from the sublease as initially drawn.  Para. 10 of the new sublease provided that the sub-tenant (and now Brick Corp. as the
    assignee of the sub-tenant) had the sole right, on ninety days notice to the
    sub-landlord (Brick Windsor), to terminate the remaining term of the sublease. 
    If the sublease was terminated pursuant to this term, Brick Corp. could vacate

    new sublease (para. 37).  He further held that J.S.M. had no knowledge of this
    new sublease until after this litigation commenced.  Both findings are fully

    in the “Consent and Acknowledgement” executed in June 1987 is the sublease as
    it existed in June 1987 and not the new sublease created in March 1988.  I
    agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that J.S.M.’s contractual rights under
    the “Consent and Acknowledgement” could not be affected by a new sublease
    entered into several months later without notice to J.S.M.  The terms of the
    new sublease, in particular the early termination provision, are irrelevant to J.S.M.’s
    contractual rights under the “Consent and Acknowledgement” executed in June
    1987  </p>

    successor of Brick Corp., exercised the first of the two five-year renewal
    options available under the sublease.  Brick Windsor, the sub-landlord,
    notified J.S.M. that the option had been exercised.  Under the renewal, the
    sublease and the head lease remained in force until 2001.  J.S.M. was not
    informed by the Brick enterprise that a new sublease containing an early
    termination date had been entered into some eight years earlier by Brick
    Windsor.  J.S.M. understood that the renewal was on the same terms as the

    termination provision in the new sublease, advised the sub-landlord, Brick Windsor,
    that it would terminate the lease as of February 2000.  In early February,
    Brick Windsor notified J.S.M. that its sub-tenant, Brick Corp. #3, would be
    vacating the premise at the end of February.  Brick Windsor also advised J.S.M.
    that it would be unable to pay the rent beyond that date.  In late February, it
    was agreed that the sub-tenant would remain in place until the end of March
    2000.  The Brick store was closed by the end of March 2000.  In June 2000,
    J.S.M. terminated its lease with Brick Windsor for non-payment of rent and

line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge carefully analyzed the contract claim of J.S.M. (paras.

    the “Consent and Acknowledgement” does give rise to a contractual claim by J.S.M.
    against Brick Corp. for the unpaid rent. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “Consent and Acknowledgement” reflected a bargain struck
    among the three signators to that agreement.  Pursuant to the bargain, J.S.M. gave
    certain consents to corporate entities within the Brick enterprise, including Brick
    Corp., and those entities, in exchange for those consents, promised to assume certain
    obligations under the sublease.  The obligations were those found in the
    original sublease.  Those obligations continued in effect throughout the
    initial ten-year term of the sublease and for the five-year renewal period after
    the renewal option was exercised in 1996 (para. 63);</p>
  <p><span

    of the consents given by J.S.M. to the assignment of the sublease and Brick
    Corp.’s purchase of the business being operated on the leased premises (para.
    50);  </p>
  <p><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.M. relied on Brick Corp.’s promise to assume all obligations

    a contractual relationship between J.S.M. and Brick Corp.  The trial judge
    concluded, however, that Brick Corp.’s promise to abide by the terms of the
    sublease, found in para. 5 of the “Consent and Acknowledgement”, was made
    exclusively to Brick Windsor and could not be enforced by J.S.M.  The trial
    judge made this finding despite his further finding that J.S.M. relied on Brick
    Corp.’s promise to abide by the terms of the sublease in advancing
    consideration to the Brick Corp. in the form of the two consents given by

    sublease was made only to its immediate landlord, Brick Windsor, the trial
    judge relied exclusively on the language of clause 5 of the “Consent and

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Clause 5 in the
    Consent and Acknowledgement dated June 1, 1987, <u>imposes an obligation upon
    Brick Corp. to Brick Windsor, and not directly to J.S.M., to meet the subtenant
    Brick Warehouse’s obligations to pay rent to Brick Windsor under the sublease.</u> 
    However, implicit in J.S.M. agreeing to the Consent and Acknowledgement, as
    would be known and understood by the Brick parties, is the promise that Brick
    Corp. will meet the rent obligations under the sublease.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>There was no
    privity between J.S.M. and Brick Corp. in respect of the first five covenants. 
    I agree there is no covenant from Brick Corp. to pay rent directly to J.S.M.</u> 
    However, there were representations and undertakings by Brick Corp. in Clause 5
    of the Consent and Acknowledgement (that the rent under the sublease will be
    paid).  These representations remain relevant to the issues at hand, <u>notwithstanding
    that the contractual obligation in Clause 5 was simply from Brick Corp. to
    Brick Windsor.</u> [Emphasis added.]  </p>

    language of that document as “mutual covenants”.  </p>

    Corp. in the form of the two consents given by J.S.M.  The appellants submitted
    that the consents could not constitute valid consideration because J.S.M.’s
    consent was not required under the terms of the head lease.  My reading of
    para. 7.03.2 of the head lease (<i>supra</i>, para. 19), like that of the trial
    judge’s, is to the contrary.  I think that provision does envision J.S.M.’s
    consent to the assignment of the sublease to Brick Corp. and to Brick Corp.’s
    operation of the business on the leased premises.  </p>

    those consents to Brick Corp. still constituted valuable consideration.  At a
    minimum, J.S.M.’s consents brought certainty to what would otherwise have been Brick
    Corp.’s uncertain entitlement to the assignment and to occupation of the leased
    premises.  The consents given by J.S.M. put those entitlements beyond any doubt. 
    For that reason alone the consents had value to Brick Corp. and constituted
    consideration flowing from J.S.M. to Brick Corp. under the terms of the
    “Consent and Acknowledgement”.</p>

    compliance with the obligations under the sublease.  Those obligations include
    payment of the rent and occupation of the premises throughout the term of the
    lease and the renewal of the lease.  The obligation of continued compliance
    with the sublease described in para. 1 must be directed at Brick Corp., the
    assignee of the sub-tenant and the operator of the business on the leased premises. 
    Paragraph 1 places an obligation on Brick Corp. to comply with the sublease in exchange
    for J.S.M.’s consent to the assignment of the sublease.  Paragraph 5 of the
    “Consent and Acknowledgement”, which contains Brick Corp.’s express promise to Brick
    Windsor to comply with the obligations of the sublease, is a further indication
    that compliance with the sublease described in para. 1 refers to compliance by
    Brick Corp.  In my view, para. 1 of the “Consent and Acknowledgement” connects
    the consideration advanced by J.S.M. to Brick Corp. (the consent) to Brick
    Corp.’s promise to comply with the sublease.  This connection makes Brick

    corporate entities were all fingers of the same hand.  Those in control of the
    Brick enterprise presented these corporate entities to J.S.M. as
    interchangeable parts for the purposes of the lease and related subleases and
    assignments.  None of the corporate machinations engineered by the Brick
    enterprise were held out to J.S.M. as having any effect on J.S.M.’s rights
    under its lease.  J.S.M. had every reason to regard its dealings with respect to
    the lease as being with the Brick enterprise as a whole and not with any discrete
    corporate entity that the Brick enterprise might choose to use for any given
    transaction.  J.S.M. read the “Consent and Acknowledgement” prepared by the
    Brick enterprise lawyers in that light.  </p>

    was relying on the Brick enterprise’s representation that the obligations under
    the lease would be fulfilled.  The Brick enterprise appreciated that J.S.M. was
    dealing with the Brick enterprise and not individual corporate entities.  The
    Brick enterprise also knew that J.S.M. was the ultimate beneficiary of any of

    that sublease, Brick Corp. was obligated to pay the rent throughout the full term
    of the sublease and the first renewal period.  J.S.M. gave consideration for
    Brick Corp.’s promise and was entitled to take action against Brick Corp. under
    the agreement when Brick Corp. broke its promise to J.S.M., abandoned the
    leased premises, and stopped paying rent.  Brick Corp.’s liability under the
    contract with J.S.M. is the amount of the unpaid rent.  </p>

  <h4>THE OPPRESSION REMEDY</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found that Brick Corp. is liable in contract, it is unnecessary
    for me to consider J.S.M.’s oppression claim or the tort claim.  I will,
    however, address the appellants’ submission that relief under the oppression
    remedy is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It cannot be gainsaid that the oppression remedy gives the court a broad
    discretion.  That discretion is directed both at those who can qualify as
    “complainants” for the purpose of bringing an oppression application and the
    nature of the remedy that can be granted if the requisite oppression is
    established.  See James Farley, Roger J. Chouinard &amp; Nicholas Daube,
    Expectations of Fairness:  The State of Oppression Remedy in Canada Today (2007) 33 Advocates’ Q. 261. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The oppression remedy is not, however, a means by which commercial
    agreements negotiated at arms length by sophisticated parties can be rewritten
    to accord with a court’s after-the-fact assessment of what is “just and
    equitable” in the circumstances.  It is not the function of the court to
    rewrite contracts or to relieve a party to a contract of the consequences of an
    improvident agreement.  See <i>Jedfro Investments (U.S.A.) Ltd. v. Jacyk</i>, [2007]
    S.C.J. No. 55 at para. 34.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S.M. and the Brick enterprise entered into a business arrangement in 1986
    when they negotiated the head lease.  There is no suggestion of any
    relationship between them other than commercial landlord and commercial tenant. 
    Nor is it contended that there was any imbalance of power between the two such
    that it might be said that the terms of the lease were not the product of
    legitimate arms length negotiation.  Subsequent agreements between J.S.M. and
    the various Brick companies were negotiated in the same way.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasonable expectations of parties to commercial agreements
    negotiated at arms length must be those reasonable expectations that find expression
    in the agreements negotiated by the parties.  For example, when J.S.M. initially
    negotiated the head lease, it did not negotiate any provision in that lease that
    would allow it to look to any party other than the tenant, Brick Ltd., for
    payment of the rent upon a breach of the lease.  Having negotiated a detailed
    lease which did not bind any other entity, J.S.M. could not be heard to argue that
    it reasonably expected that some other corporate entity would be liable if Brick
    Ltd. breached the original lease.  The fact that Brick Ltd. had no assets
    certainly suggests that J.S.M. may have acted improvidently in agreeing to look
    only to Brick Ltd. for recovery.  A bad bargain cannot, however, alter J.S.M.’s
    reasonable expectations or render the breach of the lease oppressive conduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, if, contrary to my holding on the contract claim, the
    “Consent and Acknowledgement” did not give J.S.M. recourse against Brick Corp.
    for unpaid rent, then J.S.M. could not argue that it reasonably expected to
    have rights it had not negotiated in its agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If, again, contrary to my holding above, J.S.M. had negotiated to
    recover unpaid rent as against only Brick Windsor and Brick Ltd., the two shell
    companies, J.S.M.’s subsequent inability to make any real recovery when the
    lease was breached would have nothing to do with the Brick enterprise’s
    subsequent unilateral and devious rewriting of the sublease.  If J.S.M. did not
    have a contractual claim against Brick Corp., it would not have been the terms
    of the new sublease that frustrated J.S.M.’s ability to make any real
    recovery.  J.S.M.’s inability to reach a corporate entity with assets, had I
    come to a different conclusion on the contractual claim, would have been the
    product of J.S.M.’s own failure to adequately protect its position in its
    negotiations with the Brick enterprise, and not the product of any oppressive
    conduct on the part of any corporate entity within the Brick enterprise.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would adopt, as applicable to the facts of this case, the observations
    of Kevin P. McGuiness, The Law and Practice of Canadian Business Corporations
    (Toronto: Buttersworth, 1999) at para. 9.247:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In most cases
    it would seem reasonable to hold the creditors of the corporation are limited
    to the normal remedies for a breach of contract (including any available
    security or personal guarantee) should the corporation default in performance, <u>for
    it cannot have been intended that the oppression remedy would be available
    where a creditor failed to protect himself or herself adequately against the inherent
    risks of doing business with a corporation.</u>  While acts of oppression may
    entail a breach of contract, or the commission of some tortious or similar
    wrong, against the complainant, it is doubtful that the oppression remedy was
    intended to be a substitute for an ordinary right of action in contract – or
    tort for that matter.  Where the sole complaint is that of a breach of
    contract, then a contract action should be pursued.  Insofar as the contract
    deals with a specific matter, it seems only natural to conclude that it sets
    out exhaustively the underlying intentions, understandings and expectations of
    the parties.  While many – perhaps all – breaches of a contract can be characterized
    as oppressive to the injured party, and while many – perhaps all – forms of
    tortious injury may be said to be unfairly prejudicial, the legislature clearly
    cannot have intended for the oppression provisions to serve as a panacea for
    all manner of legal wrongs, or to make the remedies created under the statute
    for genuine cases of oppression or unfair prejudice a substitute for the normal
    legal and equitable remedies that are available to aggrieved parties.  Where a
    simple breach of contract, or comparable legal wrong has occurred, it is not
    appropriate for the court to invoke the oppression provisions of the Act merely
    because the party in breach is a corporation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I stress Mr. McGuiness’ observation that the oppression remedy is not
    intended to give a creditor after-the-fact protection against risks that the
    creditor assumed when he entered into an agreement with a corporation.  The
    position of a creditor who can, but does not, protect itself against an
    eventuality from which he later seeks relief under the oppression remedy, is
    much different than the position of a creditor who finds his interest as a
    creditor compromised by unlawful and internal corporate manoeuvres against
    which the creditor cannot effectively protect itself.  In the latter case,
    there is much more room for relief under the oppression provisions than in the
    former case.  See <i>S.C.I. Systems, Inc. v. Gornitzki Thompson &amp; Little
    Co. Ltd. </i>(1997), 147 D.L.R. (4th) 300 (Gen. Div.) var’d on other grounds
    (1998), 110 O.A.C. 160 (Div. Ct.); see also M. Koehnen, Oppression and Related
    Remedies (Toronto: Carswell, 2006) at pp. 88-93.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the factual circumstances of this case, J.S.M.’s claim against Brick
    Corp. could succeed only if properly founded in contract or tort.  There was no
    basis for an assertion by J.S.M. that its reasonable expectations were other
    than those it negotiated in the various relevant agreements.  If, contrary to
    my holding above, those agreements provided no remedy against Brick Corp., it
    was not for the court, through the invocation of the oppression remedy, to
    correct J.S.M.’s failure to bind Brick Corp. to the lease.  </p>
