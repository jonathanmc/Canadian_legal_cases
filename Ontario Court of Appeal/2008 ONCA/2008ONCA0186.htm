style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 1994, the respondent Magnussen Furniture Inc. (MFI) entered into
    a relationship with the appellant Mylex Limited (Mylex) for the manufacture and
    supply of custom-designed furniture.  The relationship was short-lived.  When
    Mylex missed promised delivery dates and problems arose concerning the quality
    of the goods provided to MFI, litigation ensued.  After 24 days of trial before
    Reilly J. of the Superior Court of Justice, Mylex was found liable to MFI in
    both contract and tort for damages in the amount of $1,267,514.95, plus costs. 
    Mylex appeals in respect of both liability and damages.  MFI, in turn,
    cross-appeals against the trial judge’s damages and costs awards. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and
    cross-appeal.  In my view, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
    occurred in this case so as to warrant a new trial.  Nor am I persuaded that
    interference by this court with the results at trial is otherwise justified.    </p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       The Relationship</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early 1990s, MFI was an established furniture manufacturer and
    distributor with offices and a manufacturing plant in Ontario, a national
    distribution network across Canada, and operations in the United States.  It sold its products to customers such as The Bay, Leon’s, Sears and Bad
    Boy for resale to consumers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1994, MFI decided to convert its “fully assembled” line of wooden home
    entertainment and wall units to “ready-to-assemble” (RTA) units made from
    composite materials.  Its plan was to close its manufacturing plant, outsource
    the manufacture of the RTA furniture and market the new product itself.  MFI
    anticipated that its RTA program would initially involve sales of about $5
    million per year in Canada.  Depending on its success in Canada, MFI intended to expand the RTA program into the American market.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After considering potential suppliers, MFI decided to approach Mylex, a
    Toronto-based manufacturer with experience in the production of RTA furniture. 
    In October 1994, Richard Magnussen – MFI’s president – met with Michael Burger and
    his brother, David Burger, the owners and operators of Mylex.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex expressed interest in the project and agreed to make samples of the
    RTA units, which MFI could display to its customers at the Toronto Furniture
    Show to be held in mid-January 1995.  By the time of this trade show, Mylex had
    manufactured seven samples for MFI and discussions were underway about the
    detailed design of the furniture.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex informed MFI that once the design of the RTA furniture was
    finalized, the engineering phase would require four to five weeks for
    completion.  Thereafter, actual production of the RTA units would take only
    five days from the date of receipt by Mylex of a purchase order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 30, 1994, although the final design of the RTA furniture had
    not been settled, MFI sent a purchase order to Mylex for 3,250 RTA units,
    having a value of $322,250.  The order provided for a February 15, 1995 delivery
    date, FOB Toronto, net 30 days.  Mylex accepted the purchase order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI’s customers reacted favourably to the RTA samples at the Toronto Furniture
    Show.  As a result, MFI placed a total of eight additional purchase orders with
    Mylex for RTA product, with delivery dates ranging from February 24 to July 4,
    1995.  Mylex accepted each of these purchase orders.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The delivery dates were crucial to MFI’s business.  MFI sold RTA units and
    fixed delivery dates with its customers based on delivery dates arranged with
    Mylex.  In turn, MFI customers advertised the availability of RTA product to
    consumers at times set in accordance with MFI’s delivery commitments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout December 1994 and January 1995, MFI sought various changes to
    the design of the RTA product.  For this and other reasons, the February 1995
    delivery dates proved to be unrealistic.  However, on the findings of the trial
    judge, the design issues were largely resolved by mid-February and Mylex should
    have been in a position to deliver RTA product to MFI by mid-March “at the
    latest”.  Nonetheless, Mylex’s first production run was not scheduled to occur
    until March 27, the March delivery date was missed, and the first delivery of
    RTA units to MFI did not take place until April 7.  Even then, Mylex delivered only
    208 of the 3,250 units ordered by MFI on December 30.  A further 192 units were
    received by MFI on April 10.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Mylex’s subsequent deliveries were “sporadic
    and incomplete”.  By late April 1995, Mylex had failed to meet any of the
    scheduled March and April delivery dates.  It had also placed MFI’s April
    purchase orders, which provided for delivery dates in June and July, “on hold”
    pending further discussions between the parties.  In addition, numerous issues
    regarding the quality of the RTA units arose, only some of which were
    acknowledged and remedied by Mylex.  Not surprisingly, by the spring of 1995, the
    relationship between the parties had significantly deteriorated.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other events strained the relations between the parties.  In April, without
    prior consultation with MFI, Mylex announced significant price increases for
    the RTA product.  Then, in May, it unilaterally imposed a $100,000 credit limit
    on MFI notwithstanding that no such limit previously applied to MFI’s credit
    arrangements with Mylex.  Magnussen viewed this change as rendering it
    “impossible to even flow goods”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 1995, MFI began to search for another RTA furniture
    manufacturer.  By early May, it had committed to use Carina Furniture as an alternate
    supplier.  In mid-May, Magnussen wrote to Michael Burger, indicating that all
    outstanding MFI orders were to be considered cancelled if not received by MFI
    at its factory by May 25, 1995.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A key meeting between the parties occurred on May 23, 1995.  Mylex and
    MFI hold very different views as to the events that transpired at this meeting. 
    Mylex contends that the parties reached a settlement agreement at the meeting,
    whereby the parties agreed to delay the delivery dates on four outstanding
    purchase orders until the end of June 1995, to cancel MFI’s remaining purchase
    orders, and to stop doing business together.  In contrast, MFI maintains that
    it continued to look to Mylex for fulfillment of its pre-existing contractual
    obligations after the May 23 meeting.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, MFI had a tense and embarrassing meeting with one of
    its largest customers, the Cantrex Group, an association of 1,100 independent
    retailers.  The Cantrex Group was upset because MFI had failed to meet agreed delivery
    dates for RTA units, leaving Cantrex members unable to satisfy their own
    consumer delivery commit-ments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 1995, Magnussen sent a letter to Michael Burger in which he
    alleged that Mylex had “committed serious breaches of its contractual
    obligations” to MFI.  He also said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As we have expressed to your company on many
    occasions, your continued missed delivery dates have resulted in lost sales
    opportunities for [MFI] and ha[ve] also caused our customers to lose confidence
    in our ability to meet our commitments.  In making commitments to our customers
    we have, of course, relied upon Mylex’s promises of delivery by certain agreed
    upon dates.  As you can appreciate, the missed delivery of advertised product
    has seriously marred [MFI’s] reputation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We do not wish to become involved in litigation and
    are prepared to overlook your breaches of contract if you will agree to meet
    the following delivery dates with respect to outstanding orders.  [Specified
    delivery dates – ranging from June 1 to June 15, 1995 – omitted.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex responded within days, when Michael Burger telephoned Magnussen and
    informed him that Mylex would not be filling MFI’s existing orders.  This
    prompted Magnussen to write to Michael Burger on June 7, expressing his “shock”
    and frustration and reiterating: “I can only stress again, we must receive our
    orders – your lack of commitment to delivery is causing major damage to [MFI’s]
    64 years of flawless reputation in the furniture business.”  The trial judge
    found that this letter effectively brought the parties’ business relationship
    to an end.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carina, MFI’s alternate supplier, began delivering RTA product to MFI in
    mid-July 1995.  Although no problems with Carina developed, by the end of 1995
    Magnussen believed that “the damage was done” and decided to terminate MFI’s RTA
    program.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Litigation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In August 1995, MFI sued Mylex for damages in the amount of $5 million
    for breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and loss of profits.  At
    the end of trial, it amended its pleading to increase its damages claim to the
    sum of $7.65 million.  Mylex defended the action and counterclaimed against MFI
    for damages concerning outstanding payments for product delivered.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that by failing to meet the agreed delivery
    dates, Mylex breached both an “overall contract” entered into by the parties
    and the purchase orders.  He also held that Mylex was negligent because “some
    if not much of the product” that it supplied to MFI was not of merchantable
    quality.  By judgment dated February 21, 2006, he held Mylex liable to MFI in
    damages for breach of contract and negligence.  After crediting Mylex with the
    sum of $82,485.05 admittedly owed to it by MFI for product delivered, he
    awarded MFI damages in the sum of $1,267,514.95, plus prejudgment interest.  He
    subsequently awarded costs of the proceedings to MFI, in the total amount of
    $397,404.50.  </p>
  <h2>ISSUES </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are four issues on the appeal:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by finding that there was an “overall contract”

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by failing to find that the parties reached a

  <h2>ANALYSIS </h2>
  <h2>(1)       The Finding of an “Overall Contract”</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that the parties entered into an “overall contract”
    at the “onset” of their dealings, whereby MFI agreed to purchase and Mylex
    agreed to supply RTA units to MFI on an ongoing basis in accordance with individual
    purchase orders placed by MFI from time to time.  The trial judge found that the
    overall contract contained four basic terms: (i) it obliged Mylex to deliver RTA
    units ordered by MFI within five days from the date of Mylex’s receipt of a
    purchase order and, in any event, by the delivery dates specified by MFI; (ii)
    it precluded Mylex from “refus[ing] to accept a reasonable purchase order or cancel[ling]
    one already accepted without bearing the consequences of such refusal or
    cancellation”; (iii) it required each party to provide reasonable notice to the
    other of an intention to terminate their relationship; and (iv) it obliged both
    parties to act in good faith towards one another in furtherance of their
    agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex argues that the trial judge erred in finding that there was an
    overall contract between the parties.  I agree for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, with respect, the trial judge erred in his appreciation of MFI’s pleaded
    case in contract.  According to the trial judge, MFI <i>pleaded</i> that: (i)
    “the parties entered into a binding contract with long term intentions”; (ii) an
    overall contract existed between the parties; (iii) Mylex was “under an
    obligation to deal in good faith with [MFI]”; and (iv) Mylex “could not
    terminate this obligation without appropriate notice”.  This description of
    MFI’s pleading is inaccurate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply put, MFI did not plead the existence of an ‘overarching’ or
    overall contract or any terms thereof.  Contrary to the trial judge’s
    above-quoted statements, MFI alleged in its pleading that it “first contracted”
    with Mylex by virtue of the December 1994 purchase order and that it displayed
    the RTA samples made by Mylex at the Toronto Furniture Show in reliance upon
    “[this] agreement”.  Further, MFI’s pleading contained no assertion that Mylex
    was obliged to provide notice of the termination of the parties’ relationship
    or that Mylex was required to deal with MFI in good faith.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did MFI seek an amendment of its pleading at trial to allege an
    overall contract, despite doing so in respect of its damages claim.  The trial
    transcript reveals that it was the trial judge who first suggested, in exchanges
    with MFI’s trial counsel, the idea of an overall contract and the possibility of
    an at-trial motion by MFI to amend its pleading to assert such a contract. 
    These suggestions were immediately resisted by Mylex’s trial counsel, in part
    on the ground that they were inconsistent with MFI’s pleading.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI argues that these omissions in its pleading are irrelevant because Mylex
    itself pleaded the existence of an overall contract.  It points out that Mylex
    alleged in its amended statement of defence and counterclaim that MFI delivered
    purchase orders “in accordance with the original agreement” between the parties. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that Mylex’s pleading overcomes the identified
    deficiencies in MFI’s pleading.  Mylex’s pleading does not clearly assert an
    “overall” contract in the sense articulated by the trial judge.  For example,
    Mylex did not plead any terms of an alleged overall or “original” contract
    beyond those contained in the purchase orders.  In any event, the case that MFI
    was entitled to pursue – and obliged to prove – at trial was the case framed by
    its own pleading, not that of the defendant.  See generally <i>Kalkinis
    (Litigation guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.) at 533-34, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1999]
    S.C.C.A. No. 253; and <i>Authorson (Litigation Administrator of) v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the evidence of the conduct of the parties, objectively viewed, does
    not support the conclusion that they entered into a binding overall contract,
    separate and apart from the purchase orders, of the type found by the trial
    judge.  The evidence indicates that MFI’s plans for an RTA program were dependent
    on the outcome of the Toronto Furniture Show.  On December 29, 1994 and January
    19, 1995, MFI wrote to Mylex indicating that it would be placing additional
    orders for RTA units after a review of the Toronto trade show “stats” and
    “results”.  The effect of these letters was to reserve to MFI the right to
    control and determine future RTA furniture orders with Mylex, depending on the
    reactions of MFI customers to the new product. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI thus held open the possibility of no future orders if, contrary to
    its expectations, its customers’ reactions to the RTA samples were adverse. 
    This possibility is inconsistent with an existing overall agreement whereby MFI
    was obliged to purchase and Mylex was required to supply RTA units
    indefinitely.  To the contrary, MFI’s letters suggest that the display of the RTA
    samples at the Toronto Furniture Show was intended by MFI to ‘test the market’
    for the new product, following which MFI would determine its future business
    with Mylex.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that, notwithstanding frequent communications between the
    parties and the litany of delivery and product quality problems that emerged
    concerning the RTA furniture, at no time did MFI complain to Mylex nor did
    Mylex claim against MFI that the other of them was in breach of any obligations
    beyond those contemplated by the individual purchase orders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it is difficult to reconcile the trial judge’s finding of an
    overall contract, originating at the onset of the parties’ dealings in October
    1994, with sound business practice.  It would make little commercial sense for
    MFI to unequivocally commit to the purchase of RTA product from Mylex on an
    indefinite basis before it gauged customer reaction to the new product at the
    1995 furniture show.  Viewed from Mylex’s perspective, the design and,
    therefore, the engineering of the RTA furniture were unsettled until mid-February
    1995.  Why would Mylex, an experienced furniture manufacturer, commit in 1994
    to supply on demand and for an indefinite period product that was still
    undefined, thereby rendering its own manufacturing costs and production
    obligations uncertain?  As Michael Burger said in his trial testimony: “We’ve
    got to walk before we run.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in my view, there is considerable force to Mylex’s argument
    that the parties failed to agree on terms essential to the creation of a
    binding overall contract of the type found by the trial judge.  For example,
    the extent and timing of MFI’s purchasing obligations after the first purchase
    order were unresolved.  As well, the trial judge’s findings with respect to the
    pricing of the RTA units are inconsistent with the conclusion that a binding
    overall contract of indefinite duration for the supply of goods at agreed
    prices was concluded in 1994.  Although the trial judge said that pricing was
    discussed and agreed on by the parties, he also held that Mylex’s price list
    was first furnished to MFI on December 29, 1994 (the day before MFI’s first
    purchase order), that pricing discussions continued throughout the spring of
    1995 and were specifically discussed at a meeting in mid-March of that year,
    and that Mylex unilaterally imposed significant price increases in April 1995. 
    In my view, agreed pricing terms would have been essential to the formation of
    a binding overall contract in October 1994.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in finding an overall
    contract between the parties.  However, it is also my view that this error does
    not implicate trial fairness in the circumstances of this case or otherwise undermine
    the trial judge’s liability holding against Mylex.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, this is not a case where one party to an action was taken by
    surprise by a position advanced at trial by an opposing litigant or by a theory
    of liability articulated by the trial judge for the first time in his or her
    reasons.  The transcript reveals that during counsel’s exchanges with the trial
    judge at trial, the prospect was clearly raised that the determination of MFI’s
    contract claim could be based on a finding of a breach by Mylex of an overall contract
    between the parties.  Moreover, there is no dispute that the concept of an
    overall contract was developed and argued by the parties as the trial unfolded. 
    As Mylex’s counsel responsibly acknowledged during oral argument before this
    court, Mylex was not “blindsided” by the trial judge’s finding of an overall
    contract.  On the facts of this case, therefore, it cannot be said that trial
    fairness was compromised by the trial judge’s finding of an overall contract.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge found that Mylex breached both the overall
    contract <i>and</i> the terms of the specific purchase orders by missing
    promised delivery dates.  He also held that Mylex was liable to MFI in
    negligence because much of the furniture delivered to MFI was not of
    merchantable quality.  Mylex does not challenge these critical findings, which
    amply support the trial judge’s ultimate liability holding against Mylex.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue, therefore, is whether the trial judge’s error in finding the
    formation of an overall contract fatally taints his damages assessment.  For
    reasons I will explain in my discussion of the trial judge’s damages award, it
    is my view that this error does not have this effect.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>&amp; (3)        The Alleged Settlement Agreement </h2>
  <p style='page-break-after:

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex argues that the parties reached a binding settlement at their May
    23, 1995 meeting whereby, in addition to varying the delivery dates on four
    outstanding purchase orders, they agreed to terminate their relationship. 
    According to Mylex, by virtue of Richard Magnussen’s subsequent letter of May
    31, 1995 to Michael Burger, which I have described above, MFI wrongfully
    repudiated this settlement agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge expressly considered and rejected these claims, holding
    that while Mylex viewed the relationship at an end by the May 23 meeting, MFI
    continued thereafter to insist on performance by Mylex of its pre-existing
    contractual obligations.  He found that while Mylex was in breach of both the overall
    agreement and the individual purchase orders, MFI “chose not to treat their
    contractual relationship at an end” and “continued to insist upon delivery in
    fulfillment of Mylex’s contractual obligations”.  Further, the trial judge accepted
    MFI’s position that Magnussen’s letter of May 31, 1995 to Mylex was “simply
    [MFI’s] attempt to ‘get Mylex’s attention’ and to confirm specific dates for
    delivery of product that [MFI] was committed to deliver to its customers”.  He
    held that Mylex, rather than MFI, wished to terminate the parties’ relationship
    and that Mylex took advantage of Richard Magnussen’s letter of May 31 “to
    repudiate the contractual relationship between the two companies”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these findings were open to the trial judge on the evidence
    adduced at trial.  Accordingly, there is no basis for appellate interference
    with them.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex submits that documents contemporaneously prepared by MFI
    concerning the May 23 meeting indicated an agreement at the meeting that the
    parties would “go their separate ways”.  In particular, it argues that the
    agenda for the meeting contemplated the possibility that there would be no
    future business between the parties after the meeting and, further, that the
    “minutes” of the meeting confirmed a “work out” agreement by the parties to end
    their relationship.  I would not accede to this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contents of the agenda did not reflect a decision or even a
    preference by MFI to terminate its arrangements with Mylex.  While the agenda listed
    items for discussion in the event of “no future business” between the parties,
    it also identified matters that required resolution if the parties engaged in
    future business.  Thus, as Magnussen claimed in his testimony, both options – a
    continuation of business relations and a termination of such relations – were
    held open as possibilities by the terms of the agenda.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the “minutes” of the meeting do not clearly document an
    agreement by the parties to terminate their business relationship.  The
    “minutes” were prepared by John Schaub, MFI’s purchasing manager.  In his
    covering memo to Mylex, which accom-panied the “minutes”, and in his trial
    testimony, Schaub indicated that the document was a “summary” of the May 23
    meeting.  The summary stated in part:</p>

    beyond their control …</p>

    be supplying further product</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>6.         [MFI]
    will remit to Mylex, one half of the die costs for carton printing.  Mike
    [Burger] agreed to have Jack [of Mylex] release ownership of these dies to
    [MFI].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            [Emphasis

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The import of these entries, particularly item five, was a matter of
    considerable controversy at trial.  The contents of the summary, especially
    item five, could be read as indicating that the termination of the parties’
    relationship was discussed at the May 23 meeting.  In addition, as Mylex points
    out, at one point during his examination-in-chief at trial, Schaub said that
    the parties “mutually agreed” at the May 23 meeting that, following completion
    of the purchase orders mentioned in the summary, MFI would “no longer be buying
    any more product from Mylex”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But item five and the other entries in the summary make no express reference
    to any agreement between the parties to terminate their business dealings.  In
    contrast, elsewhere in the summary reference is made to an “agreed” credit
    limit of $100,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, on cross-examination, Schaub essentially testified that MFI
    was presented at the meeting with a unilateral <i>fait d’accompli</i> by Mylex. 
    He said that at the May 23 meeting, Mylex was “giving up on the project” and
    that it “no longer wanted to supply [MFI]”.  When it was specifically put to
    him that the parties “agreed” at the meeting that Mylex would not be supplying
    further product, Schaub responded: “We were advised that by both Michael and
    David [Burger].  That was the last of the orders they would produce for us” and
    “[T]here wasn’t much more choice.  We weren’t going to get a supply of
    product.”  Schaub went on to say that the summary of the May 23 meeting was not
    a summary of “what was agreed to” but, rather, a summary of “what was
    advised”.  He reiterated: “<i>We were told</i> that that was the end of, at
    this meeting <i>we were told</i> that was the end of, that was the end of it.” 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Schaub also said that MFI had invested “a lot of time and effort” with
    Mylex and that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It certainly would be to our benefit to continue
    with Mylex if they would be professional about it and offer delivery dates in
    writing, finalize costs so we don’t have cost increases un-expectedly.  So
    certainly we would want to do more business if they would comply with those
    issues.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following exchange during Schaub’s cross-examination is also pertinent:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that’s in fact what the agreement was, that the project would be
    completed or could I say wrapped up?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        We
    had product on order with Mylex.  If Mylex wanted to communicate and work with
    us <i>we could have gone further on this project but at this point we were

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Magnussen’s trial testimony also supports the conclusion that no binding
    settlement agreement was entered into by the parties at their May 23 meeting.  Magnussen
    was adamant that MFI did not agree with Mylex’s plan to stop shipping RTA
    product beyond the four purchase orders mentioned in the summary of the May 23
    meeting.  He maintained that MFI was “being told we have no choice” and that it
    was “not agreeing to it”.  After extensive cross-examination on the issue,
    Magnussen explicitly denied that a consensus was reached by the parties at the
    meeting.  He stated unequivocally: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It wasn’t a consensus.  It was a reality.  They’re
    telling us they’re not going to supply any more product.  We need the product. 
    I think in June, a later letter, we beg them again one more time to get the
    product there because we need it for our customers.  When you say consensus, I
    do not agree with that word.  It was not a consensus.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, David Burger – the only witness called by Mylex at trial –
    testified that it was mutually agreed between the parties on May 23 that MFI
    did not want any more product from Mylex and that Mylex’s participation in
    MFI’s RTA program was terminated. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the documentary evidence, together with
    Magnussen’s, Schaub’s and David Burger’s testimony about the May 23 meeting,
    and held that the meeting marked the “beginning of the end” rather than an
    agreed termination of the parties’ relationship.  While not stated explicitly,
    the trial judge’s reasons indicate that he found that no consensus <i>ad idem</i> was achieved by the parties concerning the termination of their business
    arrangements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the face of conflicting evidence about the May 23 meeting, the trial
    judge was entitled to accept Schaub’s and Magnussen’s testimony, over David
    Burger’s, in support of MFI’s claim that no settlement agreement was concluded. 
    Regardless of Mylex’s own views before and after the meeting concerning its future
    business dealings with MFI, there was evidence before the trial judge that
    supported his finding that MFI still “preferred to continue dealing with Mylex
    as long as Mylex would supply a product of appropriate quality in a timely
    fashion”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept Mylex’s argument that the trial judge erred in law in
    rejecting the posited settlement agreement by taking into account the
    intentions of the parties.  The assessment of what transpired at the May 23
    meeting and the determination of whether a new or revised agreement was
    concluded at that meeting required an objective analysis.  Contrary to Mylex’s
    submission, a full reading of the trial judge’s reasons indicates that his
    evaluation of Mylex’s claim of a settlement agreement was not based on his
    perception of the subjective “inner wishes” of Magnussen and Schaub.  Rather,
    it was anchored in his evaluation of the parties’ intentions as manifested by
    the events which preceded and followed the May 23 meeting, including the
    parties’ written communications about the meeting and the witnesses’ evidence
    that tended to prove or disprove the alleged settlement agreement.  As the
    party propounding the theory of a critical settlement agreement, Mylex bore the
    onus of establishing its formation.  The trial judge essentially held that
    Mylex failed to discharge this evidentiary burden.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that I would also reject Mylex’s submission that the trial
    judge erred by failing to find that MFI repudiated the contract between the
    parties, as varied at the May 23 meeting.  As Mylex acknowledges, this submission
    is predicated on a finding that a binding settlement or “work out” agreement
    was entered into by the parties on May 23, 1995.  But the trial judge rejected
    this assertion – as he was entitled to do – holding instead that apart from the
    deferred delivery dates on four purchase orders, MFI continued to insist upon
    compliance by Mylex with its pre-existing contractual obligations and that
    Mylex, rather than MFI, decided to terminate the parties’ relationship.  These
    findings are unimpeachable on this record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to Mylex’s grounds of appeal
    relating to liability.  I turn now to the trial judge’s assessment of damages.</p>
  <h2>(4)       The Damages Award </h2>
  <h2><i><u>Background</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As was made clear during oral argument before this court, neither party
    suggests that the measure of MFI’s damages would differ if evaluated on the
    basis of tort, rather than contract, principles.  Accordingly, both parties
    accept the trial judge’s conclusion that “it makes little difference” to the
    assessment of damages in this case “to differentiate damages based on Mylex’s
    failure to deliver [the RTA product] in a timely fashion and Mylex’s failure to
    deliver product of merchantable quality”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two methods for the assessment of MFI’s damages were identified at
    trial.  The first method involved a calculation of the profits lost by MFI on
    orders for RTA furniture actually cancelled due to MFI’s inability to meet
    promised delivery dates.  This approach favoured Mylex because, as the trial judge
    observed, “The calculation of lost profit on actual orders cancelled as a
    result of [MFI’s] failure to deliver product in 1995 would amount to a
    relatively modest amount.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second method, urged by MFI and accepted by the trial judge, focused
    on MFI’s lost profits and lost marketplace opportunity arising from Mylex’s
    breach of contract and negligence.  The trial judge described it this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he plaintiff is asking the court to consider the
    impact of missed delivery dates and quality issues and the consequent impact on
    the failed RTA program on potential profits in 1995 and in years then following
    and to calculate damages based on these lost profits and lost opportunity in
    making a global award in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI called Thomas Dyson as an expert business valuator to provide
    opinion evidence in support of its damages claim.  Mylex called no expert
    witness on damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was Dyson’s evidence that MFI’s total damages arising from Mylex’s
    breach of contract were $7.657 million, comprised of $3.717 million for past
    losses and $3.94 million for future losses.  He arrived at this conclusion in
    the following fashion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dyson calculated MFI’s damages based on his estimates of its lost income
    in two time periods: January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2001 (“past losses”) and
    January 1, 2002 onwards (“future losses”). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to MFI’s past losses, Dyson estimated MFI’s likely future
    sales of RTA product, assuming that the RTA program was successful.  This
    estimate was based on MFI’s historical sales of its home entertainment product and
    its internal business projections for the RTA program.  Dyson next calculated
    MFI’s lost sales by comparing its estimated likely future sales with its actual
    reported sales.  Finally, he determined the loss of profit arising from the
    loss of sales.  Based on this analysis, he concluded that MFI’s past losses as
    at December 31, 2001 were approximately $3.717 million:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dyson estimated that MFI’s future losses (<i>i.e.</i>, its losses from
    January 2002 onwards), approximated $675,000 per annum, based on the assumption
    that MFI’s level of annual profits after 2001 would have approximated the levels
    estimated for the years 1998 to 2001, had Mylex’s breach of contract not
    occurred.  Dyson then capitalized this $675,000 figure to arrive at a present
    value for MFI’s future stream of lost profits.  By this method, he concluded that
    MFI’s future losses fell within the range of $3.375 to $4.5 million.  In his opinion,
    the mid-point of this range, $3.94 million, was an appropriate estimate of
    MFI’s future losses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted that Mylex’s failure to meet committed delivery
    dates and the quality problems that plagued the RTA units caused MFI to lose
    revenue from both cancelled and future sales, the latter due to MFI’s loss of
    reputation in the industry.  He held that MFI suffered “significant damages”
    from Mylex’s breach of contract and negligence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in the trial judge’s view, “significant contingencies” existed
    that “may well have impacted [on MFI’s] projected profits even if Mylex had
    delivered acceptable product in a timely way”.  Because of these contingencies,
    the trial judge concluded that MFI had a “reasonable possibility” rather than a
    “reasonable certainty” of success with its RTA program, warranting “a
    significant reduction” in the amount of damages claimed by MFI.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge held that MFI was entitled to a global
    damages award reflecting lost profits for a two-year period.  He set MFI’s
    annual lost profits at $675,000.  This resulted in a total damages award to MFI
    in the amount of $1.35 million, before any deduction on account of Mylex’s
    counterclaim for payments owed for product delivered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge expressed his conclusion on damages in these terms: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In all the circumstances, I conclude that [MFI] is

    Instead I conclude that [MFI] is entitled to damages reflec-ting lost future
    profits for a two year period.  The annual figure for lost profits I set at
    $675,000 which is based upon Thomas Dyson’s opinion as to a reasonable figure
    for projected annual lost profits following a transition period involving the
    conversion to the RTA program.  Therefore I conclude that [MFI] is entitled to
    damages in the amount of $1,350,000.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mylex attacks the trial judge’s damages award on the narrow basis that the
    trial judge erred by selecting a two-year period for the assessment of damages following
    “a transition period” for the establishment of the RTA program.  Mylex submits
    that the trial judge was obliged to award damages only for the two years
    immediately following Mylex’s breach of contract, that is, for the period
    mid-March 1995 to mid-March 1997.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court’s review of the damages award in this case must proceed on
    the basis that, absent legal error, a trial judge’s assessment of damages
    attracts great deference from an appellate court.  This court is not entitled
    to substitute its own view of a proper award unless it is demonstrated that the
    trial judge made an error in principle, misapprehended the evidence, failed to
    consider relevant factors, considered irrelevant factors, made an award without
    any evidentiary foundation, or otherwise made a wholly erroneous assessment of
    the damages: see <i>Naylor Group Inc. v. Ellis-Don Construction Ltd.</i>,
    [2001] 2 S.C.R. 943 at para. 80; and <i>Woelk v. Halvorson</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
    430 at 435.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the two-year period chosen by the trial judge and the
    $675,000 in annual damages awarded by him for that period are grounded in the
    evidence of Dyson, the only expert to testify on damages.  The trial judge
    confined MFI’s damages claim to a two-year period of lost profits to take
    account of MFI’s failure to prove its projected future profits to a standard of
    “reasonable certainty”.  In choosing <i>this</i> period and <i>this</i> quantum
    of damages, the trial judge accepted those of Dyson’s calculations of MFI’s
    lost profits that, in his view, best reflected the years when MFI’s losses
    would be manifest, allowing for: (i) sufficient time for MFI to convert its
    product to the RTA line, for the RTA product to achieve marketplace acceptance,
    for the cancellation of orders, and for damage to MFI’s reputation in the
    industry to occur; and (ii) the uncertainties of the ultimate success of the RTA
    program. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his report dated June 28, 2002, Dyson indicated that the first step
    in his calculation of MFI’s past losses was to estimate MFI’s likely future
    sales of RTA furniture “had the relationship with Mylex been successful”. 
    Dyson’s calculation of post-2001 losses (future losses) also assumed that
    Mylex’s breach of contract had not occurred.  In addition, Dyson relied in his
    own calculations on MFI’s sales projections for RTA product for the years 1996
    to 1998.  As the trial judge recognized, “These projections were based upon the
    assumption that after a relatively brief transition period [MFI] would replace
    the success it had previously enjoyed with its furniture built in the
    traditional way with the new RTA line.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, therefore, Dyson’s calculations assumed the passage of
    sufficient time to permit MFI to convert its product line to the RTA format,
    for product to be delivered by Mylex, and for the RTA program to achieve
    success in the marketplace.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge indicated that his lost profits figure of $675,000 per
    annum was based on “Dyson’s opinion as to a reasonable figure for projected
    annual lost profits following a transition period involving the conversion to
    the RTA program”.  On Dyson’s calculations, MFI’s annual past losses for the
    years 1998 to 2000 approximated $675,000.  The two-year period chosen by the
    trial judge for the quantification of damages and the annual damages fixed by him
    for those two years – $675,000 – correspond with Dyson’s calculations of MFI’s
    annual losses for the third and fourth years of the RTA program after its
    implementation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was not obliged to accept the entirety of Dyson’s
    evidence.  This was especially so given the trial judge’s finding that Dyson’s
    analysis was predicated on sales projections (and, hence, profit projections)
    that were not established to a reasonable certainty.  Nor was the trial judge
    required to accept MFI’s position that only a short time would be required to
    successfully transition from its former furniture line to the RTA product and
    to establish a market niche for the new RTA line.  In arriving at an
    appropriate damages award, the trial judge was entitled to choose a two-year
    period for the quantification of damages that <i>best</i> reflected MFI’s lost
    profits, taking account of “all the circumstances”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in selecting the appropriate two-year period for this purpose,
    the trial judge was mindful of the applicable legal principles that governed his
    assessment of damages in this case.  Among other authorities, the trial judge
    relied on the decision of this court in <i>Canlin Ltd. v. Thiokol Fibres Canada
    Ltd.</i> (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 687, in which the court upheld an assessment of
    loss of profits that recognized the plaintiff’s deprivation of future business,
    loss of goodwill and loss of reputation resulting from the defendant’s breach. 
    In <i>Canlin</i>, Cory J.A. indicated that “An assessment of future loss of
    profits must, of necessity, be an estimate” (at p. 691).  Justice Cory
    elaborated at p. 695:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>The amount of future profits and the period for
    which they should be allowed will depend upon the facts of each individual case</i>. 
    Although such damages may be difficult to assess, it must be remembered that
    they arise as a result of the breach of the defendant and the court should make
    all reasonable efforts to assess those damages. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in this case recognized that the quantification of MFI’s
    damages for potential lost profits in 1995 and for future lost profits
    thereafter was difficult.  He undertook this assessment in a fashion similar to
    that accepted in <i>Canlin</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the case at bar the defendant Mylex when it
    entered into an agreement with the plaintiff [MFI] to supply product clearly
    knew that [MFI] relied upon a timely delivery of that product to its customers
    and that <i>the failure of </i>[<i>MFI</i>]<i> to deliver such product would
    not only result in cancelled sales but also to loss of future sales and damage
    to </i>[<i>MFI’s</i>]<i> reputation generally.  The loss of those future sales
    and </i>[<i>MFI’s</i>] <i>opportunity in the marketplace flow naturally from
    Mylex’s failure to meet its contractual obligations</i> with respect to timely
    delivery and quality of product and also to MFI’s loss of reputation generally
    as a result thereof.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was also alive to the requirements that MFI establish,
    on a balance of probabilities, that Mylex’s breach of contract resulted in the
    damages claimed and that the damages claimed were not too remote.  In assessing
    MFI’s damages for lost profits against these principles, the trial judge relied
    especially on <i>Houweling Nurseries Ltd. v. Fisons Western Corp.</i> (1988), 49
    D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>th</span>) 205 (B.C.C.A.),
    leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused (1988), 89 N.R. 398n.  In that case,
    McLachlin J.A., then writing for the British Columbia Court of Appeal, stated
    at pp. 209-10:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The basic rule is that damages for lost profits,
    like all damages for breach of contract, must be proven on a balance of
    probabilities.  Where it is shown with some degree of certainty that a specific
    contract was lost as a result of the breach, with a consequent loss of profit,
    that sum should be awarded.  However, damages may also be awarded for loss of
    more conjectural profits, where the evidence demonstrates the possibility that
    contracts have been lost because of the breach, and also establishes that it is
    probable that some of these possible contracts would have materialized, had the
    breach not occurred.  In such a case, the court should make a moderate award,
    recognizing that some of the contracts may not have materialized had there been
    no breach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reliance on <i>Houweling</i>, the trial judge discounted the damages
    claimed by MFI to take into account various risk contingencies, including those
    that would operate against the success of the RTA program, and rejected Dyson’s
    overall estimate of MFI’s lost profits.  He did this in part by the device of
    limiting MFI’s recovery of damages to two years.  I see nothing objectionable
    in this approach, which was directly responsive to the issue whether MFI had
    established its projected loss of profits to the requisite standard of proof. 
    The trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am not persuaded that [MFI’s] claim for damages
    based upon its business projections and Thomas Dyson’s report has been
    established with “reasonable certainty and precision on a balance of
    probabilities”.  Therefore the full damages claimed based upon such projections
    are not recoverable.  I am persuaded that [MFI] has established a “reasonable
    possibility (of such profits) which to some extent would probably have
    materialized”.  Thus, in accordance with [<i>Houweling</i>], [MFI] is entitled
    to a reduced or “moderate” award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I would also reject Mylex’s submission that the two-year period
    chosen by the trial judge for the assessment of damages rests on the validity
    of the trial judge’s finding of the existence of an overall contract between
    the parties.  Mylex’s breach of MFI’s purchase orders led to the same damages
    said by MFI to arise on the breach of the overall contract.  Accordingly, the
    error that I have concluded was made by the trial judge – the holding that an
    overall contract was entered into by the parties – has no impact on his
    assessment of damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, in making a global award of damages to MFI, the trial judge
    accepted that MFI’s damages could be assessed based on the evidence of MFI’s
    projected profits from the RTA program, discounted for applicable
    contingencies.  He was not satisfied that MFI had discharged its evidentiary
    burden to establish its claimed lost profits in full.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the trial judge’s selection of the appropriate time period
    for the quantification of damages took account of Dyson’s analysis and the
    following factors: (i) the time required for MFI to transition to a successful
    RTA program; (ii) the time necessary for MFI to sustain the loss of orders
    actually cancelled as a result of missed delivery dates and quality-control
    issues; (iii) the time required for the loss of future business occasioned by damage
    to MFI’s industry reputation; and (iv) the substantial contingencies that
    underpinned MFI’s failure to establish the likely success of the RTA program and,
    hence, MFI’s projected future profits to a standard of reasonable certainty.  In
    my view, the trial judge did not err by proceeding in this fashion.  I would
    therefore dismiss Mylex’s appeal from the trial judge’s damages award.</p>
  <h2><i><u>MFI’s Cross-appeal on Damages</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI makes two arguments on its cross-appeal concerning damages.  It asserts
    first, that the trial judge misapprehended its position on damages for future
    losses by improperly concluding that it was seeking damages “in perpetuity”. 
    Next, it argues that the trial judge’s restriction of its damages to two years
    of lost profits was based on the erroneous conclusion that MFI could have
    resurrected the RTA program after Mylex’s breach of contract and that its
    failure to do so warranted a reduction in the damages to which it would
    otherwise have been entitled.  I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI’s own factum on appeal belies its disclaimer of a claim for damages
    in perpetuity.  MFI’s factum is replete with references to its claim for
    damages “in perpetuity”<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[6]</span></span></a></span> and to the trial judge’s rejection of that claim.  For example, in its factum, MFI
    expressly sought an award of what it called “perpetuity damages” of $1.576
    million from this court.  Nowhere in its factum does MFI contend that the trial
    judge erred in his appreciation of the nature of MFI’s damages claim concerning
    future lost profits.  This assertion was first advanced in oral argument before
    this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, MFI’s attempt to now recharacterize the nature of this part of
    its damages claim is contrary to the evidence of its own damages expert.  On
    cross-examination, Dyson expressly confirmed that his calculations for MFI’s
    future losses comprised “damages in perpetuity”.  MFI acknowledged this in its
    factum on appeal by referring to Dyson’s calculations of post-2001 lost profits
    as “the full amount claimed for damages in perpetuity”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, I agree with Mylex’s submission that MFI’s
    effort on appeal to distance itself from a claim for damages in perpetuity
    cannot be accepted.  To ignore MFI’s own previous descriptions of its damages
    claim regarding future losses (treated by Dyson as post-2001 lost profits)
    would be unfair to Mylex and the trial record.  Having elected to put its damages
    case at trial in part on the basis of a claim for damages in perpetuity, it is
    far too late for MFI to resile from this position. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept MFI’s argument that the trial judge erred by reducing
    its damages because it failed to resurrect the RTA program after its
    relationship with Mylex ended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on the trial judge’s observation that “[n]otwithstanding the
    absence of any vigorous effort to … ‘resurrect’ the program, in excess of
    $700,000 of product was sold in the RTA line in 1996”, MFI submits that,
    contrary to the evidence, the trial judge “must have concluded that there was a
    sound argument that the [RTA] program could have been resurrected”.  MFI
    further asserts that, by so concluding, the trial judge mis-applied the
    principles governing MFI’s duty to mitigate its damages by requiring it to act
    contrary to its own commercial interests, thereby improperly penalizing it for
    its failure to resurrect the RTA program.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, these submissions misconstrue the heart of the trial
    judge’s reasoning in support of his rejection of that part of MFI’s damages
    claim that Dyson referred to as “future losses” and that MFI called
    “perpetuity” damages ($3.9 million).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge explicitly stated: “Whether the [RTA] program could have
    been resurrected and recovered from the damage it suffered as a result of
    Mylex’s breach of contract and negligence remains uncertain.”  Thus, contrary
    to MFI’s submission, the trial judge made no finding that the RTA program was
    capable of ‘resuscitation’.  Instead, he expressly found that the prospects for
    its resurrection were uncertain.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the trial judge made no finding that MFI’s decision to end
    the RTA program was unreasonable or that the termination of the program
    constituted a failure by MFI to mitigate its damages.  The trial judge found
    that MFI took “reasonable steps to mitigate its damages”, including by
    arranging for an alternate supply of RTA product from Carina, and that the
    decision to terminate the RTA program “may have been a sound business
    decision”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the trial judge referred to the failure to resurrect the
    RTA program as an “<i>arguable</i> failure [by MFI] to fully mitigate its
    damages”.  [Emphasis added.]  He also said: “[T]he plaintiff cannot have it
    both ways.  [MFI] cannot terminate the program without further efforts to resurrect
    it with a new reliable supplier and then expect the defendant Mylex to
    compensate it in perpetuity for what might have been a successful plan.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, however, on a full reading of the trial judge’s reasons,
    these comments indicate the trial judge’s awareness that, in the absence of evidence
    of any effort to re-establish the RTA program, or other proof that the program would
    have succeeded but for Mylex’s breach of contract, MFI was overreaching by
    claiming damages on an indefinite basis due to Mylex’s wrongful conduct.  In
    other words, MFI’s lack of effort to continue or resurrect the RTA program was
    one of the factors considered by the trial judge in assessing whether the RTA
    program would have been successful, that is, whether MFI had proven its claimed
    loss of profits in “perpetuity”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the trial judge found that the success of the RTA
    program was not a “reasonable certainty” but, rather, only a “reasonable
    possibility”, with the result that MFI was entitled to only a reduced or
    “moderate” award of damages.  In its factum on appeal, MFI confirmed that it
    “takes no issue with this determination”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrast those findings with the fact that MFI’s claim for damages for
    future losses – its perpetuity damages claim – was premised on the assumption
    not only that the RTA program would have been successful, but that its success
    would have continued indefinitely.  In this context, it was open to the trial
    judge to consider whether the evidence of MFI’s treatment of the RTA program
    supported or detracted from the assumptions on which MFI’s projections of lost
    profits were premised.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not tantamount to a conclusion that MFI’s failure to resurrect
    the RTA program amounted in law to a failure to mitigate its damages – a
    conclusion not drawn by the trial judge.  In his reasons, the trial judge
    sometimes framed his consideration of this issue in the language of mitigation. 
    However, as I read his reasons, he regarded the evidence of MFI’s lack of
    effort to resurrect the RTA program and its decision to terminate the program
    as relevant to the sufficiency of the evidence relied on by MFI to support its
    lost profits claim and to the soundness of the assumptions upon which that
    claim was based.  This evidence, therefore, formed part of “all the
    circumstances” that the trial judge said that he considered in determining that
    MFI was not entitled to recover in full the lost profits that it claimed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, having considered Dyson’s opinion on damages and the
    assumptions on which it was based, the trial judge fashioned an award of
    damages on a global basis in a reduced amount to take account of the serious
    risk contingencies that he identified, especially the possibility that the RTA
    program may have failed or that MFI’s projected profits from the program may
    not have been realized.  On the facts of this case, this approach to the
    assessment of damages cannot be faulted.</p>
  <h2>(5)       The Costs Award</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its costs submissions at trial, MFI claimed counsel fees in the
    amount of $122,872.50 for the attendance at trial of two senior counsel.  The trial
    judge awarded $84,000 for counsel fees at trial, a reduction of $38,872.50 from
    the amount sought by MFI.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFI
    argues that, in so doing, the trial judge erred in principle by applying the
    former costs grid set out under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C. 43 after it had been revoked and, further, by applying the grid in a
    mechanical fashion, leading to an award that it claims was inconsistent with
    the trial judge’s own view of the fair and reasonable costs of attendance by
    counsel at trial.  I would not give effect to these sub-missions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scope for appellate review of a trial judge’s discretionary costs award is
    especially limited.  Unless the costs award is plainly wrong or the trial judge
    has erred in principle, appellate interference is precluded: see <i>Hamilton v.
    Open Window Bakery Ltd.</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at para. 27.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recognized that although the costs grid was in effect at the time
    of trial, it was revoked prior to his costs ruling.  Nonetheless, in his view,
    the grid could be seen “as a reliable parameter for assessing counsel fees at
    trial”.  He therefore reduced the counsel fees sought by MFI by applying a
    block fee of $17,500 per week for four weeks plus four days of trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in this discretionary decision by the trial judge.  On my reading
    of the trial judge’s costs ruling, he did not automatically or rotely apply the
    grid to his assessment of counsel fees in this case.  Rather, he simply
    regarded the grid’s provisions concerning counsel fees at trial as a useful
    guide to an appropriate award for this item of costs in this case,
    notwithstanding that the grid itself had been revoked.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did
    the trial judge err in his consideration of the decision of this court in <i>Celanese
    Canada Inc. v. Canadian National Railway Co. </i>(2005), 196 O.A.C. 60, leave
    to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 245.  In <i>Celanese</i>,
    Borins J.A. of this court, writing for himself on this issue, considered the
    scope for an allowance of counsel fees for more than one counsel at trial where
    the grid applied.  He held that, under the grid, the recovery of fees for a
    second counsel at trial was permissible so long as the aggregate of the counsel
    fees allowed did not exceed the maximum fees permitted under the costs grid.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s costs ruling in this case reflects his appreciation that <i>Celanese</i> was ‘a grid case’ and that the grid – having been revoked – did not bind him. 
    On my reading of his ruling, he did not treat the decision in <i>Celanese</i> as
    dictating the maximum limits of an award in this case for counsel fees at
    trial.  Rather, his ruling suggests that he regarded <i>Celanese</i> as
    determining the issue of appropriate block fees for counsel in cases where the
    grid applied and that he viewed those block fees as also appropriate in this
    case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was within the trial judge’s discretion to determine whether counsel fees in
    the amount contemplated by the grid were appropriate for application here.  In
    deciding to apply this aspect of the grid provisions, the trial judge
    specifically adverted to Borins J.A.’s cautionary words in <i>Celanese</i> at
    paras. 50-51, citing this court’s decision in <i>Boucher v. Public Accountants
    Council for the Province of Ontario</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 at para. 37:
    “[I]n the final analysis the court must step back and consider the total amount
    of costs applying the ‘overriding principle of reasonableness’. ”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elsewhere
    in his ruling, the trial judge also addressed the length and complexity of the
    trial, the nature of the services performed before and at trial by the two
    senior counsel in question, the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged and
    the factors outlined in Rule 57.01 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> for
    consideration by the court when awarding costs.  I see no basis on which to
    conclude that he ignored these considerations when evaluating an appropriate
    quantum of costs for counsel fees at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, although I might have approached the matter differently, I cannot
    conclude that the trial judge’s costs award for counsel fees at trial was plainly
    wrong or that it flowed from an error in principle.  </p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  I would also dismiss the
    cross-appeal on damages, grant leave to appeal costs, and dismiss the
    cross-appeal on costs.  As success in this court was divided, there should be
    no order as to the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>

    Michael Burger, the president of Mylex, was involved from the outset in Mylex’s
    dealings with MFI, was present at the May 23 meeting, and was the principal
    Mylex representative who dealt with Magnussen, he did not testify.  Similarly,
    Jack Leung of Mylex, who shared responsibility with Michael Burger for
    manufacturing, was not called by Mylex as a witness at trial.  While the trial
    judge declined to draw an adverse inference against Mylex for its failure to
    call these potential witnesses, he did emphasize that the only oral evidence
    offered by Mylex at trial in support of its version of events, including the
    events at the May 23 meeting, was that of David Burger.</p>

    were lower than in succeeding years because MFI made some profits in those

    period” was a mistake.  Dyson calculated MFI’s past losses over a seven year
    period.  The trial judge awarded damages for two years on account of what Dyson
    called “past losses”.  Thus, in my view, the trial judge’s mention of five

    decided to disallow.  </p>

    1995 to 1997 are adjusted to conform to this two-year period, the maximum
    amount of damages that could have been awarded to MFI was $590,480.11, less the
    sum of $82,485.05 admittedly owed to Mylex in respect of its counterclaim,
    yielding a net damages award of $507,995.06.  Although Mylex argued in its
    factum on appeal that the sum of $590,480.11 should be further reduced on
    account of various contingencies that it alleged were ignored by the trial judge,
    it abandoned this position in oral argument.</p>
