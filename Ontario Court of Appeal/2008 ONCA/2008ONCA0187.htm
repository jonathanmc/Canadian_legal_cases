line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal by the trustee in bankruptcy from the decision of
    Brockenshire J., which dismissed the trustee’s motion to examine the court-appointed
    interim receiver under ss. 163 and 164 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (<i>BIA</i>).  The trustee’s motion had also sought to vary
    the sale approval and vesting order made by Brockenshire J. on April 23, 2003,
    approving the interim receiver’s sale of the assets of Impact Tool and Mould
    Inc.  The basis for the trustee’s motion was its stated concern regarding the
    propriety of selling Impact’s assets to a new company formed by two of Impact’s
    former principals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a preliminary matter on the appeal, Windsor Precision Gundrill Inc.
    sought to review the order of LaForme J.A. dated February 13, 2008, which
    dismissed its motion to intervene in this appeal.  Following oral argument, we
    dismissed the motion for review.  We agree with LaForme J.A. that the proposed
    intervener would add nothing to the argument to be made by the trustee: <i>Pearson
    v. Inco Ltd. </i>(2005), 195 O.A.C. 77 (C.A.) at para. 6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trustee also applied to admit fresh evidence.  Following oral
    argument, we dismissed that application because the proposed evidence does not
    meet the test in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the trustee’s motion to examine the interim
    receiver for two reasons: first, because four years had passed since the sale
    was approved and implemented; and second, because the interim receiver had
    already responded to the trustee’s questions, providing “much more information
    than unsecured creditors, hoping to receive something from the bankruptcy,
    could reasonably expect.”  The motion judge also took into account the fact
    that the trustee had succeeded in obtaining confidential information from the
    National Bank, another of Impact’s secured creditors, so that the trustee “may now
    know more than the Receiver about Impact.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three legal issues raised by the trustee on the appeal are: (1)
    whether a trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to examine a court-appointed
    receiver as of right under s. 163(1) of the <i>BIA</i>, (2) alternatively, if
    leave of the court is required for such an examination, whether the unusual
    circumstances of this sale justify granting leave; and (3) whether paragraph 15
    of the sale approval and vesting order should be varied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing with issues (1) and (2) together, we do not need to decide
    whether there is an absolute right for a trustee to examine a court-appointed
    receiver, or whether leave is required, because we see no error in the motion
    judge’s conclusion that, through the informal question and answer process, the interim
    receiver has provided all the information requested and required by the
    trustee.  As the motion judge said, the trustee was not able to “point to a
    lack of information or a refusal to provide information which would in any way
    support his application.”  Counsel for the trustee was given the further
    opportunity to point to any area of deficiency in the interim receiver’s
    responses on oral argument of the appeal, but was unable to do so. Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the trustee’s appeal on these issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to issue (3), paragraph 15 of the sale approval and vesting
    order reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THIS COURT
    ORDERS that, notwithstanding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(a)   the pendency of these proceedings;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(b)   the bankruptcy of Impact Tool &amp; Mould Inc.; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(c)   the provisions of any federal or provincial
    statute,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>neither the
    Purchase Agreement and the Transactions nor the vesting provisions of this
    Order will be void or voidable at the instance of creditors and claimants and
    do not constitute nor shall they be deemed to be settlements, fraudulent
    preferences, assignments, fraudulent conveyances or other reviewable
    transactions under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> or any other
    applicable federal or provincial legislation, and they do not constitute
    conduct meriting an oppression remedy and shall be binding on the trustee in
    bankruptcy of the Estate of Impact Tool &amp; Mould Inc.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge refused to vary this paragraph on the basis of delay
    and because the trustee failed to establish any error or omission in the
    order.  We see no error in the motion judge’s conclusions.  Under s. 187(5) of
    the <i>BIA</i>, a party may move to vary an order. However, that section cannot
    be used purely for the purpose of bringing an appeal out of time: <i>Re Catalina
    Exploration &amp; Development Ltd</i>. (1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 95 at 102-103
    (Alta. C.A.). That is essentially what the trustee was attempting to do in this
    case.  No appeal was taken from the sale approval and vesting order issued on
    April 23, 2003, although the trustee was appointed within a month of that date.
     In an earlier matter on this bankruptcy that came before this court in 2006,
    the court noted that no appeal had been taken from the sale approval and
    vesting order: (2006), 79 O.R. 241 at para. 19.  The trustee is now seeking to
    appeal the order under the guise of a variation.  Eliminating a critical
    paragraph of a vesting order four or five years after the transaction took
    place is not a variation, and cannot be accomplished under s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i> or the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  The interim receiver is entitled
    to partial indemnity costs as claimed against Gundrill in the amount of
    $9,498.30, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  The interim receiver is entitled
    to partial indemnity costs of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., against
    the trustee for the trustee’s fresh evidence application.  The interim receiver
    is entitled to costs of the appeal in the amount of $15,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.  The costs against the trustee are awarded against the
    trustee personally because it was acknowledged that this is currently a
    no-asset bankruptcy.  </p>
