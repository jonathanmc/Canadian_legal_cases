line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the motion judge’s order dismissing his motion to set aside
    or vary the order of Herold J.  Herold J.’s order is the last in a series
    of orders dealing with the appellant’s failure to answer undertakings given
    on his discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first order is the order of Sproat J. requiring that a series of undertakings
    be answered.  The second order is the order of Seppi J. that again ordered
    the appellant to answer the same undertakings failing which the respondent
    was at liberty to move ex parte to strike the appellant’s pleading.  The
    order of Herold J. is the ex parte order striking the appellant’s pleading
    for failure to comply with Seppi J.’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the appellant and respondent seek to file fresh evidence consisting of affidavits
    from their solicitor or former solicitor.  In our view, the fresh evidence
    ought not to be admitted for two reasons.  First, that evidence could have
    been adduced at the original motion by due diligence.  Second, the affidavits
    are directed principally at whether the order Sproat J. ought to have been
    granted.  That order is not under appeal and the evidence in the affidavits
    would not, therefore, reasonably have affected the result on the motion under
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the appeal itself, we see no basis for allowing it.  The issue
    argued before the motion judge was whether the ex parte order should be set
    aside on the basis that the respondent had not made full, fair and frank
    disclosure to Herold J.  Before us the appellant made the further submission
    that the materials in the record showed that the undertakings had been answered
    and that the order of Seppi J. has been complied with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge carefully reviewed the materials filed both on the motion before
    Herold J. and before him and concluded that the respondent had made a full,
    fair and frank disclosure to Herold J.  We see no basis to interfere with
    this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second submission is that the material demonstrates that the
    undertakings had been answered prior to Herold J. hearing the ex parte motion.  As
    a result, the affidavit filed by the respondent on that motion stating that
    no answer and no reasonable explanation for a lack of an answer had been
    provided for about forty undertakings was misleading.  The appellant submits,
    therefore, that the order striking the pleading ought not to have been granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  Although the material filed provides an answer to each of the
    undertakings given, many of these answers are simply unhelpful or unresponsive.  By
    way of example, several of the answers given were that the information or
    documents sought had already been provided, the appellant did not remember
    the information being requested or the appellant simply did not know what
    was being asked of him.  In our view, taken as a whole, it is fair to say
    that the answers provided were not truly responsive to the undertakings given
    and did not demonstrate an honest attempt to obtain and provide the information
    and documents sought.  We also note that this submission was not made to
    the motion judge and is made, for the first time in this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was, therefore, reasonable for Herold J. to conclude, based on the materials
    filed, that the appellant had not provided proper answers to the undertakings
    and had not complied with the order of Seppi J.  Nothing before us including
    the fresh evidence sought to be filed, demonstrates that this conclusion
    is wrong or that, if it had been raised before the motion judge, it would
    have led the motion judge to set aside the order of Herold J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we see no basis for concluding that the orders of Sproat J. and
    Seppi&nbsp;J. have been complied with and find no error in the motion judge’s
    decision.  The appeal is therefore dismissed.  Costs awarded to the respondent
    fixed in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
