  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Andrew Feher, appeals the judgment of Belobaba J. dated 29 August
    2006 dismissing his fraudulent conveyance action against the respondent Maria
    Paloma Healey.  The defendant James Healey, the husband of Paloma, did not
    defend the action.  In January 2004, the appellant obtained judgment in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor for $554,131 plus costs of $6500.  However, James Healey is judgment
    proof and the appellant has recovered no money from him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue in the trial before Belobaba J. was whether a transfer by James
    to Paloma in 1997 of the matrimonial home was a fraudulent conveyance that
    should be set aside so that the appellant could look to it as a means of
    enforcing his judgment against James.  The trial judge found against the
    appellant on two bases which he summarized near the end of his judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In sum, I have found that Feher has not established,
    under s. 2 of the Act, that the disputed conveyance was made with the intent
    to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud existing or potential creditors.  And
    even if I had found otherwise, I am satisfied that Paloma as the transferee
    is protected under s. 3 of the Act –
    the property was conveyed to her for good consideration, in good faith and
    without notice or knowledge of any fraudulent intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant challenges both aspects of the trial judge’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his application of s. 2
    of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.F. 29, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.          Every conveyance
    of real property… made with intent to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors… of
    their just and lawful actions … are void as against such persons….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge accepted the evidence of Paloma about the reason
    for the transfer of the matrimonial home to her in 1997 – the marriage of
    Paloma and James had broken down and the property transfer was part of a
    comprehensive settlement of all financial matters involving the couple and
    their young children.  In addition, the trial judge noted that the transfer
    took place in 1997 – a year before the appellant inquired about the money
    he had given to James, his nephew, three years before he made a formal demand
    for the money, and five years before he commenced legal proceedings.  These
    factors – and several others – make it impossible, in our view, for the appellant
    to establish that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in
    his assessment of the evidence on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his application of s. 3 of
    the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Section 2 does not apply to an estate
    or interest in real property … conveyed upon good consideration and in good
    faith to a person not having at the time of the conveyance to the person
    notice or knowledge of the intent set forth in that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that there was no consideration on Paloma’s part for the
    transfer to her of the matrimonial home and that, in any event, Paloma never
    signed the separation agreement in which the transfer was set out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt with both of these points.  He found that Paloma had given
    up something substantial – support payments for herself and the children – in
    return for sole ownership of the matrimonial home.  Moreover, the fact that
    Paloma did not sign the separation agreement did not vitiate their oral agreement “that
    was immediately and almost fully performed by both parties” (James transferred
    title to Paloma).  We can see no error in either of these conclusions, both
    of which, again, are anchored in the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence
    which invites genuine deference from an appeal court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    consent, the appellant filed fresh evidence to the effect that the respondent
    has not paid back to her mother-in-law the $69,000 loan that was part of
    the consideration for the matrimonial home.  We do not see that this development
    affects the judgment at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to costs fixed at $3,000
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.  This amount and the costs owing on the
    trial may be taken out of the $20,000 currently held in the court as security
    for costs.</p>
