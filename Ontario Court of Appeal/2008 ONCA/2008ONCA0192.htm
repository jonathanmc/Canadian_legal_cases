line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was tried by a judge and jury on four counts of sexual assault.  He
    was convicted of three counts and acquitted on one count, and he appeals
    the convictions to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three complainants were all employees of a business run by the appellant.  One
    complainant testified that the appellant had made inappropriate comments
    about her clothing and touched her inappropriately.  The jury acquitted the
    appellant on that count. The second complainant testified that while having
    a drink at a bar one night the appellant had asked her if she liked to be
    spanked, rubbed her thigh, and forcibly attempted to put her hand under his
    shirt to rub his nipples.  The final two counts were the most serious and
    involved a third employee who testified that the appellant had non-consensual
    intercourse with her on two occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, we have concluded that the convictions must be set
    aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Non-direction
        relating to similar act evidence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant applied to have the charges severed. We are unable to accept the
    respondent Crown’s characterization of the trial judge’s brief reasons dismissing
    the severance motion as amounting to a ruling that the evidence on each count
    was admissible as similar fact evidence on each of the other counts.  The
    trial judge did not specifically state anything to this effect.  Moreover,
    at various points during the argument on the severance motion, both counsel
    and the trial judge made it clear that they were all proceeding on the basis
    that the Crown was not asking for a similar act evidence ruling but merely
    responding to the severance motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his instructions to the jury, the trial judge did segregate the evidence
    on each count but he made no reference to the use of evidence on one count
    in relation to any of the other counts.  Nor did the trial judge instruct
    the jury that it was not to use the evidence on one count to infer that the
    appellant was the type of person whose character or disposition was such
    that he was likely to have committed the offences charged on the other counts.  In
    our view, the absence of a proper limiting instruction was prejudicial to
    the appellant and the trial judge erred by failing to give such an instruction:
    see <i>R. v. M.(B.) </i>(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 41–42; <i>R. v. Simpson</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 337 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 346–47; <i>R. v. Rarru </i>(1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (S.C.C.) at 85.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Direction
        relating to s. 265(3)(d) and the exercise of authority</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge to the jury, the trial judge paraphrased s. 265(3)(d) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and instructed the jury that “no consent is obtained where the complainant
    submits or does not resist by reason of the exercise of authority.”  He instructed
    the jury that if it found that the third complainant was intimidated by the
    fact that she was present with her boss, then it was entitled to take that
    into account in assessing whether or not she had consented.  Following an
    objection by the appellant’s trial counsel, the trial judge further instructed
    the jury that it was entitled to take into account whether the appellant
    had used his relationship of authority in relation to “controlling” the third
    complainant.  The trial Crown conceded that no evidence had been led to indicate
    that the complainant's consent had been vitiated by the exercise of authority.  As
    the trial judge himself observed during submissions on the charge,
    “[n]owhere was it asserted that he exercised his position of authority to
    provoke them, or to intimidate them.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, a more careful instruction was called for to ensure that the jury
    was not misled into thinking that consent was vitiated simply because the
    appellant was in a position of authority vis-à-vis the complainants.  It
    is the exercise of authority that vitiates consent not the existence of a
    relationship of authority.  The jury should have been instructed that consent
    would be vitiated only if the Crown proved that the appellant had exercised
    his authority to obtain consent.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Crown
        counsel’s closing address</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    jury selection, Crown counsel expressed his concern over the appellant’s
    use of peremptory challenges to exclude all but one woman from the jury.  When
    asked by the trial judge whether there was anything that required corrective
    action, Crown counsel said “I don’t think so at this time, no, Your Honour”.  However,
    in his closing address to the jury, the trial Crown stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As you sit in
    the room, this jury happens to be 11 men, 1 woman. Mr. Samkov didn’t seem
    to …
    want a whole lot of women on his jury, when we look at the selection by [his
    trial counsel].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that in the context of a trial in which the Crown’s case rested on
    the assertion that the appellant was a sexual predator who had little regard
    for women, this comment was inconsistent with the duty of the Crown to present
    its case in a fair and professional manner.  Having let the matter pass at
    the jury selection stage, Crown counsel should not have made the comment
    he made in his closing address.  Despite the failure of defence counsel to
    object, the trial judge should have taken appropriate steps to ensure that
    the jury was not influenced by the comment.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Conclusion</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, particularly in light of the non-direction relating to similar
    act evidence, the appeal must be allowed and the convictions set aside and,
    following the usual practice, a new trial ordered.  We note, however, that
    as the appellant has now fully served the three-year sentence imposed by
    the trial judge, this may well be a case where the Crown decides it is appropriate
    to elect not to proceed with a second trial. </p>
