    appeal concerns the limitation period applicable to a June 1998 motor vehicle
    accident. The respondent, Jeanette Reinbrecht, sued the uninsured at-fault
    driver in June 2000, within the two year limitation period. One year later,
    in June 2001, she sued her insurer, Allstate Insurance Companies of Canada,
    the appellant in this proceeding. Allstate moved for summary judgment on
    the basis that the respondent&rsquo;s claim against it was barred by the
    expiration of the two-year limitation period. The motion judge, Crane J.,
    dismissed Allstate&rsquo;s motion. Allstate appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate
    raises two issues. First, did the motion judge err in concluding that the
    limitation period tolls based on the discoverability principle in the respondent’s
    direct action #M1206518. Second, did the motion judge err in extending the
    limitation period on the basis that the facts in this case give rise to “special
    circumstances” within the meaning of <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i>, [1972] S.C.R.
    380.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Commencement of the
        limitation period</u></b>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8(3) of Ont. Reg. 676, <i>Insurance Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, C. I.8 provides
    in its relevant part that an action against an insurer in respect of bodily
    injury shall be commenced within two years after the cause of action arises.
    The issue in this case involves the second element necessary to establish
    a cause of action, which is whether the appellant was a person “legally entitled
    to recover damages”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate
    argued that the respondent was “legally entitled to recover damages” against
    it at the time of the accident because, at that time, the respondent knew
    that she suffered both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, both of which
    she claimed in her 2001 Statement of Claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge determined that the respondent was not legally entitled to recover
    at least non-pecuniary damages until she discovered, or ought to have discovered
    by reasonable diligence, that those damages met the threshold. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent alleged that this did not occur until April 27, 2000 when the
    respondent received a medical opinion about the extent of her injuries. The
    appellant alleged it occurred earlier. Since the determination of this question
    depended on conflicting evidence, in our view, the motion judge correctly
    concluded that a trial was required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that, irrespective of when the respondent learned about
    the extent of her physical injuries, she knew about her pecuniary damages
    immediately after the accident and that the at-fault driver was uninsured
    and, accordingly, the limitation period tolled for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary
    damages at that time. This argument is wholly met by this court’s decision
    in <i>Chederovitch v. John Doe et al</i> (2004), 183 O.A.C. 284. In that
    case, Moldaver J.A. rejected the “single cause of action” paradigm on the
    basis set out in paragraph 22 of his reasons that “the legislature did not
    intend to lay a limitation trap to prevent accident victims, with pecuniary
    losses, from pursuing significant non-pecuniary damages claims.”  He concluded
    at para. 33 that “the legislature saw fit to draw a distinction that the
    common law does not recognize – the creation of two separate causes of action
    for different heads of damages arising out of the same negligent act.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying <i>Chederovitch</i> to
    the non-pecuniary damages claim in this case, the motion judge did not err
    in concluding that the matter could not be determined on a motion for summary
    judgment – a trial would be necessary to resolve the question of when the
    respondent was aware that the extent of her injuries arguably met the threshold. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>Extension of Limitation
        Period – Special Circumstances</u></b> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that even if she was out of time regarding pecuniary losses,
    this court should extend the time for her claim because to do so would not
    prejudice the appellant and because there are special circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    brings us to the second issue on this appeal:  whether the motion judge erred
    in extending the limitation period to the date the respondent sued the at-fault
    motorist in June 2001. The parties agree that the two-fold test for extending
    a limitation period depends on an absence of prejudice and a demonstration
    of special circumstances. Prejudice was not an issue before the motion judge
    or on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found special circumstances based on the peculiar three-fold
    nature of the respondent’s potential claims against the appellant. He described
    these in paragraph 27 of his reasons:  </p>
  <p>(1) The insured may sue only the <i>tort feasor.</i> Then, after obtaining
    judgment, demand payment from the insurer under the uninsured cover of the
    contract of insurance, then should there be refusal to pay, an action may
    be commenced for breach of contract. No limitation period would be involved
    prior to the date of judgment against the <i>tort feasor</i>. (2) The insured
    may bring an action naming only his or her uninsured motorist insurer. (3)
    The insured may join both the insurer and the <i>tort feasor</i> as parties
    defendant in the same action; <b><i>Johnson v. Wunderlich,</i></b><i> supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, even if the appellant were to succeed in
    having this particular action dismissed at this stage, it would remain open
    to the respondent to proceed to judgment with her action against the at-fault
    uninsured driver and thereafter seek payment of that judgment pursuant to
    the Uninsured Automobile Coverage section of the Allstate policy – this action
    revisited at a later point in time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge determined that this was a case where special circumstances
    existed and where it would be appropriate for the court to exercise its discretion
    to extend the limitation period. We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First
    the appellant does not argue that it suffered prejudice. The appellant was
    put on notice of this claim in June, 2000 when the respondent commenced his
    proceeding against the at-fault uninsured motorist. The appellant has had
    independent medical legal examinations of the respondent, has examined her
    for discovery and been provided with her medical records. In addition the
    appellant failed to bring its motion for summary judgment until April 2007
    almost six years after the commencement of the action which is the subject
    of its motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    comments of the court in <i>Johnson v. Wunderlich</i> (1986), 57 O.R. (2d)
    600 at para. 28 are apposite here:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            If the respondent is removed from the
    action at this time it will not be bound by a judgment obtained against the
    alleged tortfeasor – because the action against them is uncontested. Accordingly,
    the whole matter of liability and damages might have to be re-litigated in
    a subsequent action against the respondent on the judgment. This multiplicity
    of proceedings would be completely unnecessary. The respondent has defended
    this action to the point of trial. It has had discoveries of the plaintiffs.
    I cannot see any disadvantage to it of which it can justly complain in continuing
    this action so that it will be bound by the findings respecting liability
    and damages in the form of a declaratory judgment. This course simply has
    the effect of avoiding the unnecessary duplication of proceedings on these
    two issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this basis, we see no error in the motion judge’s finding of special circumstances
    and his discretionary decision to extend the limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent on a partial
    indemnity scale fixed in the sum of $10,860.10 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
