      assault on Mr. Philipose was particularly violent and involved repeated
      blows to the head and body, and choking and biting by at least three men.  It
      resulted in a broken and dislocated nose, a swollen and black right eye,
      an injured jaw, and cuts to his left elbow and legs.  Mr. James was struck

      appellant attacks his conviction on two grounds.  He submits, first, that
      the verdict is unreasonable given the frailties of the eyewitness identification
      evidence and, accordingly, that the conviction should be quashed.  Secondly,
      he argues that the trial judge’s reasons for conviction are inadequate
      and that the trial judge failed to address and analyze the frailties in
      the eyewitness testimony, as a result of which he is entitled to a new
      trial.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if leave
      is granted, appeals the sentence imposed on the grounds that it was excessive
      for a youthful first offender and that a conditional sentence should have
      been granted.</span></p>

      Philipose, Mr. James, and another companion attended at the Mac’s Milk
      store at around 10:30 p.m. on June 4, 2005.  While Mr. James and the other
      companion went into the store to make a phone call, Mr. Philipose remained
      by the car in the parking lot.  Mr. James testified that although the store
      itself was quite bright, it was “fairly dark” outside and “not very well
      lit”.</span></p>

      other men were in the parking lot at the time, one sitting in another car,
      a second sitting on the curb, and two others standing in the lot.  Mr.
      Philipose and his companions were initially approached by the latter two
      men while they were still in their vehicle and before Mr. James and the
      other companion went into the store.  One of the men later identified himself
      to Mr. Philipose as “Mo G” (or “Mogi”).</span><a

      his short, black hair was curly on the sides and longer as it went up under
      his black, beaked cap.  He thought the man was “Somalian”, describing the
      man’s skin colour as brown and lighter than “African black”.  The second
      man who approached the Philipose vehicle was shorter and stocky, about
      5’6”–5’8” tall, and had a shaved head.  He told Mr. Philipose he was “Irakee” and
      Mr. Philipose described him as “Arab looking”.</span></p>

      the two companions went into the store, an initially friendly conversation
      took place between Mr. Philipose and the two men portrayed above.  The
      tall man identified himself as “Mo G” and Mr. Philipose heard the men say
      they were from Ramsey, a housing complex in the neighbourhood.  The three
      men were very close to each other during this conversation, which lasted
      for three to four minutes.  Mr. Philipose testified he was close enough
      to Mo G to smell alcohol on his breath, and following a comment to the
      man suggesting he may be drunk the nature of the encounter changed.  Mr.
      Philipose had apparently “disrespected”
    Mo G.  The man who identified himself as Mo G said, “why did you disrespect
    me?” and slapped Mr. Philipose on the face.  </span></p>

      Philipose then attempted to escape to the Mac’s Milk store but was swarmed
      by “at least three guys” and the attack began.  He felt punching and grabbing
      in his pockets.  He felt his nose break.  The “Arab looking” man put his
      arm around Mr. Philipose’s neck and choked him.  Mr. Philipose heard Mo
      G say “give me your … rings or I’m going to stab you”.  A different voice
      said “take off the watch”.  In the end, Mr. Philipose’s keys were taken.</span></p>

      attack lasted for some time and only ended when Mr. James re-emerged from
      the store.  At that time Mo G and the “Arab looking” man ran away.  Mr.
      James followed them around the corner of the building, where he was met
      with a blow to the face from a closed fist.  Mr. James testified that the
      blow came from Mo G.  Mr. James gave up his pursuit, the attackers eventually
      ran away, and the assaults and robbery ended.</span></p>

      initial attempts by Mr. Philipose and Mr. James to identify their attackers
      were unproductive.  Eleven days after the assault, Mr. Philipose looked
      at police photo lineups.  He did not positively identify any of the men
      in the lineups but picked out one named Mohamed Guled saying, “This guy
      looks similar.  I’m about 75% sure.”  The next day, after viewing 200-300
      photos in an electronic “mug book” prepared by the police, Mr. Philipose
      commented on yet another individual – Abdullahi Nur – saying, “I think
      this might be him.  That definitely looks like him, Mo G.”  About a month
      later, Mr. James viewed more lineups and positively identified one of the
      men in the lineups as the man who attacked them, stating “That’s him.  That’s
      Mo G.”  The man that Mr. James positively identified was Mr. Nur – the
      same individual whom Mr. Philipose had picked out earlier.</span></p>

      six weeks after the robbery – seemingly unhappy with the progress of the
      police investigation – Mr. Philipose and Mr. James took it upon themselves
      to try to locate the man who identified himself to them as Mo G.  They
      went to Ramsey, where they suspected Mo G might live.  Ramsey is an area
      of
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa with city housing and a large population of teenagers and young adults

      Philipose and Mr. James went to a community centre in Ramsey known as the
      Boys and Girls Club.  There they spoke to a group of men at a picnic table
      and asked if they knew Mo G.  One of the men indicated he did and offered
      to call Mo G on his cell phone.  The call was made and the phone handed
      to Mr. Philipose.  The man on the phone told Mr. Philipose that he was “out
      back”.  Mr. Philipose and Mr. James looked around the side of the building
      and saw someone “raise their hand up” in the distance.  The man who raised
      his hand was with two other men and was “distinctively taller” than both
      of them.  Mr. Philipose testified that, although he was still too far away
      to see the man’s face, he was “pretty sure” the person who raised his hand
      was Mo G, his assailant.</span></p>

      arranged to meet the person on the phone elsewhere in the park and Mr.
      Philipose and Mr. James got back into their car and drove to the arranged
      spot.  They were eventually approached by three men whom they described
      as “Somalian”.  Mr. Philipose testified that, as the men got closer – twenty
      to thirty feet away – he recognized one of the three as Mo G from the Mac’s
      Milk incident.  The lighting was good, he said, as it was only around seven
      thirty in the evening and “still fairly bright”.  Mr. Philipose said in
      his examination-in-chief that he was stunned for a second to see Mo G because
      he recognized him as the man at the Mac’s Milk that night.  On cross-examination,
      however, he said he
    “wasn’t expecting to see Mo G necessarily”.</span></p>

      man whom Mr. Philipose said he recognized responded either “I’m Mo G” or “I’m
      right here”.  Mr. Philipose testified that when the man spoke he recognized
      his voice.  Rather than confront the three individuals, Mr. Philipose and
      Mr. James immediately drove away.</span></p>

      he had learned from the men at the Boys and Girls Club that Mo G might
      attend Laurentian High School, he obtained a copy of the high school yearbook.  Looking
      through the pictures – not the names – of students in grades 9 through
      12, he identified a person in one of the photographs as his assailant,
      Mo G.  It was agreed at trial that the photograph in question was the appellant’s

    is no dispute between the parties as to the inherent frailties of eyewitness
    identification evidence.  Such evidence is inherently unreliable.  It is
    difficult to assess, is often deceptively reliable because it comes from
    credible and convincing witnesses, and is difficult to discredit on cross-examination
    for those same reasons.  Studies have shown that triers of fact place undue
    reliance on such testimony in comparison to other types of evidence.  As
    a result, many wrongful convictions have resulted from faulty, albeit convincing,
    eyewitness testimony, even in cases where multiple witnesses have identified
    the same person.  See <i>R. v. Miaponoose </i>(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 445
    at 450-451 (Ont.
    <st1:place

    these reasons, although identification is a matter of fact, appellate courts
    will subject such findings to closer scrutiny than is generally the case
    with findings of fact.  Justice Doherty summarized this concept in the context
    of an unreasonable verdict argument in <i>R. v. Tat</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C.
    (3d) 481 at paras. 99-100 (Ont.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    based on eyewitness identification evidence are particularly well suited
    to review under that section.  This is so because of the well-recognized
    potential for injustice in such cases and the suitability of the appellate
    review process to cases which turn primarily on the reliability of eyewitness
    evidence and not the credibility of the eyewitness: e.g. see <i>R. v. Miaponoose,

    eyewitness identification reveals that the concerns about the reasonableness
    of such verdicts are particularly high where the person identified is a stranger
    to the witness, the circumstances of the identification are not conducive
    to an accurate identification, pre-trial identification processes are flawed
    and where there is not other evidence tending to confirm or support the identification
    evidence.</p>

      I accept the appellant’s argument that the eyewitness identification of
      the appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes against Mr. Philipose and
      Mr. James is flawed and frail in this case, I am not satisfied that disposing
      of the appeal on unreasonable verdict grounds is the appropriate route
      in the circumstances.  To do so I would have to be persuaded that, on the
      record before the trial judge, no properly instructed trier of fact acting
      judicially could reasonably have convicted the appellant: see <i>R. v.
      Tat</i> at para. 98 and <i>R v. A.(F.)</i> at para. 35.  In the end, I
      do not think the record supports such a conclusion.</span></p>

    eyewitness identification of the appellant by Mr. Philipose and Mr. James
    is undoubtedly fraught with frailties.  I shall return to those frailties
    in the next portion of these reasons when I discuss the trial judge’s decision
    and his lack of analysis of the difficulties with this evidence.  However,
    there was some evidence bolstering the identification which, in my view,
    is sufficient to take the case out of the unreasonable verdict category.</p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, there is no question that Mr. Philipose had sufficient opportunity
    to observe his assailants prior to the assault and robbery, and to do so
    at very close quarters and in a then non-confrontational atmosphere.  The
    tall “Somalian”
    identified himself to Mr. Philipose in a friendly fashion as Mo G and spoke
    to him at some length.  This lends some credence to Mr. Philipose’s testimony
    that he later recognized the voice of the man in the park as that of his
    assailant.  Secondly, Mr. Philipose testified on cross-examination that he
    wasn’t necessarily expecting to see the man who attacked him in the park
    at Ramsey.  Had a trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably,
    accepted the foregoing evidence he or she <i>could</i> have put some faith
    in the reliability of Mr. Philipose’s identification and convicted.  </p>

      central problem with the convictions, in my view, is the trial judge’s
      failure to instruct himself properly about the eyewitness testimony and
      to direct his mind to its inherent frailties.  In reasons that are barely
      four pages long, his sole reference to the law on this point is the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>I have heard a lot of evidence in this matter in dealing with the identification
    issue.  The Court must address itself as to the dangers of the identification
    evidence of witnesses to a crime.  I have tried to direct myself to that
    point, and consequently I have listened to the evidence particularly closely
    in respect to identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    I were able to ascertain from the trial judge’s reasons that he did in fact “address
    [himself] as to the dangers of the identification evidence of witnesses to
    a crime”, there would be no substance in this ground of appeal.  Respectfully,
    however, I cannot do so, and I am not confident that the trial judge truly
    addressed his mind to the frailties in the eyewitness identification testimony
    of Mr. Philipose and Mr. James.  Specifically, in this case, the trial judge
    failed to instruct himself properly about the fallacy of mistaking certainty
    for accuracy; the remarkable coincidence of both Mr. James and Mr. Philipose
    picking Mr. Nur out as the perpetrator; the weaknesses of Mr. James’ testimony;
    and the fundamental flaws in the park and yearbook identifications.  In this
    respect, the cautionary note expressed by Justice Doherty in <i>R. v. Quercia</i> (1990),
    60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 at 383 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) must be kept in mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>This is a case in which the conviction of the appellant depends entirely
    on the identification of him by the victim.  Where the Crown’s case rests
    on eyewitness identification, one is always very concerned about the reliability
    of a finding of guilt.  Legal history and data compiled by behavioural scientists
    demonstrate the validity of that concern: see “Pretrial Eyewitness Identification
    Procedures”, <i>Law Reform Commission of Canada Study Paper</i> (1983), at
    p. 7-15.  <i>The spectre of erroneous convictions based on honest and convincing,
    but mistaken, eyewitness identification haunts the criminal law.  That ghost
    hovers over this case</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was clearly impressed with the Crown witnesses, which is his
    prerogative.  But, in the circumstances he should have been more cautious
    about their identification evidence, in my view.  He was particularly impressed
    with Mr. Philipose, the victim of a violent beating, whom he commended for
    pursuing the issue of locating the assailant when the police investigation
    seemed to be flagging.  However, the trial judge appears to have placed considerable
    emphasis on the fact that Mr. Philipose “was absolutely certain that that
    was the man”, and that “there was no doubt in Mr. Philipose’s mind” that
    the man in the park who identified himself as Mo G was his assailant.  As <i>Miaponoose</i> and
    other authorities such as <i>Quercia</i> indicate, however, it is often the
    very certainty with which impressive and credible witnesses give their eyewitness
    testimony that causes triers of fact to mistake confidence with accuracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did refer to the appearance and the voice of the man in Ramsey
    park as underpinning Mr. Philipose’s “absolute certainty”.  However, he neglected
    to put his mind to the remarkable coincidence of both Mr. Philipose and Mr.
    James identifying Mr. Nur as the perpetrator.  He made passing reference
    to the fact that Mr. Philipose had mistakenly identified Mr. Nur as the perpetrator
    from the police photo lineup.  But he appears to have viewed the fact that
    Mr. Nur and the appellant were “very similar” in appearance as a factor <i>supporting</i> the
    identification of the appellant as the perpetrator, rather than as a factor
    potentially undermining the reliability of the identification.  No consideration
    was given to the latter possibility by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge appears to have given little, if any, thought to
    the specifics of Mr. James’ testimony.  In particular, he failed to note
    that Mr. James too had mistakenly identified Mr. Nur as the perpetrator from
    the police photo lineup, and, unlike Mr. Philipose, had done so positively.  Even
    at trial, Mr. James acknowledged that it was “very possible” the person whom
    he identified in the photo lineup was the assailant.  Moreover, there was
    no consideration by the trial judge as to whether Mr. James’ identification
    of the man in the park as the assailant was triggered by the almost instantaneous
    identification by Mr. Philipose rather than resulting from Mr. James’
    independent recognition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    importantly, in my view, there was no analysis by the trial judge about whether
    the park identification was fundamentally flawed from the outset because
    of the potential pre-conceived mindset of Mr. Philipose and Mr. James when
    they went there.  They had clearly gone to Ramsey hoping to find Mo G, their
    assailant.  They felt – from what their attackers had said at the time of
    the assaults – that their assailant lived in the Ramsey area.  That was their
    frame of mind upon arrival.  When they went to Ramsey, they asked about Mo
    G, and whether the men to whom they spoke knew Mo G.  They were put in contact
    with Mo G by cell phone.  The tall person with whom they spoke waved and
    identified himself as Mo G.  The tall man who approached them later in the
    park, as arranged –
    remember, the assailant was tall – identified himself as Mo G.  At the very
    least, in my opinion, this evidence called out for careful and critical analysis
    by the trial judge in order to satisfy himself that the identification of
    Mo G in the park was not the result of a pre-conceived expectation or disposition
    on the part of both Mr. Philipose and Mr. James.  It received none.  As the
    appellant submits, an identification in which the witness anticipates seeing
    the assailant, particularly when presented with only one meaningful option,
    is significantly flawed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge placed some reliance upon the fact that Mr. Philipose subsequently
    picked the appellant’s photo out of the Laurentian High School yearbook.  Counsel
    agree, however, that the subsequent yearbook identification is of little
    value if the prior Ramsey park identification was itself tainted: see <i>R
    v. Spatola,</i> [1970] 4 C.C.C. 241 at 250-251 (Ont.

line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keeping
    in mind the caution expressed in <i>Tat</i> to the effect that there are
    particular concerns with eyewitness testimony in circumstances where the
    person identified is a stranger to the witness, the pre-trial identification
    process is flawed, and where there is little other evidence tending to confirm
    or support the identification evidence – all factors of concern here – the
    trial judge was required to conduct a more careful and thorough critique
    of the eyewitness testimony than he did.</p>
