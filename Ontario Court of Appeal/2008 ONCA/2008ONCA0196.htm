    appeals involve the alleged underfunding of two pension plans.  They raise
    a question that sounds more like a riddle than a legal question:  when are
    directors and officers <i>not </i>directors and officers?  The question is
    complicated by the fact that it arises in largely uncharted legal waters – a
    lawsuit brought by a successor pension plan administrator.</p>
  <h3>BACKGROUND  </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Slater
    Stainless Corp. was the sponsor and administrator of certain pension plans
    (the “Plans”).  J. Melvin Norton was the Plans’ actuary at the relevant times
    and Aon Consulting Inc. was his employer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    order dated June 2, 2003 (the “Initial Order”), Slater was granted protection
    under the <i>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the “<i>CCAA</i>”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the making of the Initial Order, Slater had dealings with the Superintendent
    of Financial Services (the “Superintendent”) and the Financial Services Commission
    (“FSCO”) over alleged improprieties in the Plans’ actuarial reports which
    had been prepared by Norton.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Initial Order, a charge of up to $17.5 million (the “D&amp;O Charge”)
    was made against the Slater property to indemnify the Slater directors and
    officers for claims that might be asserted against them (the “D&amp;O Claims”).  A
    process to resolve claims against the directors and officers (the “Claims
    Bar Process”) was established by order dated April 30, 2004 (the “Claims
    Bar Order”).  The Claims Bar Order also provided that Slater’s directors
    and officers would be released from all claims for which the directors and
    officers were liable in their capacity as such and for which no claims notices
    had been filed by the deadline.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Superintendent filed a D&amp;O Claim (the “FSCO Claim”) in which it set out
    a number of regulatory and compliance issues in relation to Slater’s administration
    of the Plans.  One aspect of the FSCO Claim related to the asset valuation
    methods adopted in the actuarial valuation reports that Slater had filed
    with FSCO.  The reports were said to have contravened the requirements of
    the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (the “<i>PBA</i>”) and <i>Regulation
    909</i>, R.R.O. 1990.  It was alleged that had proper reports been filed,
    Slater would have been required to make additional contributions to the Plans,
    thereby reducing or eliminating the alleged deficits in the Plans.  Pursuant
    to s. 109(1) of the <i>PBA</i>, the alleged contraventions constitute an
    offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    FSCO Claim asserted, pursuant to s. 110(2) of the <i>PBA</i>, that the Slater
    directors and officers were also guilty of offences under the <i>PBA </i>because
    they “caused, authorised, permitted, acquiesced or participated in” Slater’s
    various contraventions and failed to take reasonable care to prevent Slater
    from committing the contraventions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    FSCO Claim sought a fine of $100,000 against the directors and officers for
    the alleged offences.  It also sought an order that the directors and officers
    pay $18 million plus interest into the Plans, that being the amount of the
    unremitted contributions to the Plans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CCAA </i>proceedings
    were unsuccessful in that no plan of compromise or arrangement was reached.  By
    order dated August 30, 2004, the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings were terminated
    (the
    “Termination Order”).  Pursuant to a further order made that day under the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, Slater was put into receivership.  The
    Termination Order ended the provisions in the Initial Order that had granted
    Slater creditor protection.  However, it allowed the Claims Bar Process to
    continue for certain claims already underway.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    FSCO Claim was settled.  By order dated December 9, 2004, the settlement
    was approved in the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings (the “Settlement Order”).  The
    Settlement Order required the receiver for Slater to pay $100,000 to FSCO
    from Slater’s operating reserve, in lieu of a fine under the <i>PBA</i>.  As
    well, judgment against Slater was ordered for the lesser of $18.3 million
    or the deficiencies in the Plans.  The judgment had the status of an unsecured
    judgment; there are no funds available for distribution to Slater’s unsecured
    creditors.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 8, 2004, the Superintendent appointed Morneau Sobeco Limited Partnership
    as the successor administrator of the Plans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 18, 2005, Morneau brought an action against Norton and Aon in which
    it claimed damages of $20 million, the amount by which the Plans are underfunded
    as a result of the allegedly improper actuarial reports prepared by Norton.  The
    Morneau action relates to the same actuarial reports and deficiencies as
    were the subject of the FSCO Claim and the Settlement Order.  The Morneau
    action alleges, among other things, that Norton breached the duties he owed
    to the Plans’ members and beneficiaries by preparing actuarial valuations
    that overstated the value of the Plans’ assets and enabled Slater to avoid
    making additional contributions to the Plans before becoming insolvent.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aon
    and Norton each sought to institute third party proceedings (the “Proposed
    Third Party Claims”) against certain individuals (the “Slater Personnel”).  The
    Slater Personnel are former directors, officers or employees of Slater or
    a related corporation, Slater Stainless Inc., who served on Slater’s Audit
    Committee.  Slater, as administrator of the Plans, had given the Audit Committee
    responsibility for management and administration of the Plans.  Consequently,
    the members of the Audit Committee performed Slater’s duties as the Plan
    administrator at the relevant times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Proposed Third Party Claims, Aon and Norton seek to claim against the
    Slater Personnel on the basis that the Slater Personnel, as employees or
    agents of Slater, were the governing mind of Slater <i>qua </i>administrator
    and caused or contributed to the alleged deficit.  Aon and Norton rely on
    their statutory and common law rights to seek contribution and indemnity
    from the Slater Personnel for any liability they are found to have in the
    Morneau action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Proposed Third Party Claims allege that the Slater Personnel, in their capacity
    as agents or employees of the administrator, acted negligently and in breach
    of statutory and fiduciary duties, induced or committed breaches of fiduciary
    duty, placed themselves in a position of conflict of interest and engaged
    in wilful misconduct.  The allegations include that the Slater Personnel
    followed a deliberate strategy to minimize the contributions that Slater
    would be required to make to the Plans when they knew, or ought to have known,
    that Slater was insolvent or on the brink of insolvency.  This strategy allegedly
    included instructing Norton to prepare the solvency valuation using an asset “smoothing” method
    that adjusted the value attributed to the Plans’ assets, without disclosing
    to Norton or Aon that there were doubts as to whether Slater would remain
    a going concern.  The strategy also allegedly included instructions by the
    Slater Personnel to Norton in his dealings with the Superintendent and deliberately
    delaying the proceedings with FSCO in order to avoid having Slater make pension
    plan contributions prior to seeking protection from its creditors.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Slater Personnel objected to the issuance of the Proposed Third Party Claims.  They
    maintained that the <i>CCAA </i>orders prevented such claims from being brought.  In
    particular, they relied on paras. 15 and 16 of the Termination Order.  Those
    paragraphs read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.  THIS COURT ORDERS that any person who served
    as an officer or director of any of the Applicants prior to and from and
    after June 2, 2003 is hereby released, remised and forever discharged of
    and from all claims, liabilities, obligations, demands or causes of action
    of whatever nature, including, without limitation, any and all claims in
    respect of potential statutory liabilities, whether known or unknown, matured
    or unmatured, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising by reason
    of, out of or in connection with, such service with respect to any act or
    omission, transaction or dealing or other occurrence existing or taking place
    prior to the date of this Order, and including any claim or demand for contribution
    or indemnity in respect of any act or omission, transaction or dealing or
    other occurrence which occurred in whole or in part prior to the date of
    this Order, provided that this paragraph shall not extend to any person that
    actively and knowingly participated in the breach of any related fiduciary
    duties or has been grossly negligent or guilty of wilful misconduct and provided
    that this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the rights of any person
    whose claim against such directors and officers has been allowed, partially
    allowed or is being disputed in accordance with the Claims Bar Order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16.  THIS COURT ORDERS that, until further order
    of this Court, any and all persons shall be and are hereby stayed from commencing,
    taking, applying for or issuing or continuing any and all steps or proceedings,
    including, without limitation, administrative hearings or orders, declarations
    or assessments, against any or all past, present or future directors or officers
    of any of the Applicants in respect of any matters referred to in paragraph
    15 above, save and except claims brought in accordance with the procedures
    contained in the Claims Bar Order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aon
    and Norton brought motions for declarations that the <i>CCAA </i>orders did
    not apply or, alternatively, for leave to bring their claims (the “Underlying
    Motions”).  The Slater Personnel brought a cross-motion for an order striking
    the Proposed Third Party Claims as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    two orders, both of which are dated April 13, 2007, Spence J. dismissed the
    Underlying Motions and the cross-motion (the “Orders”).  He was of the view
    that the determinative issue on the Underlying Motions and the cross-motion
    was whether the Proposed Third Party Claims disclosed a “proper cause of
    action”.  He held that they did not.  Having decided the Underlying Motions
    and cross-motion on that basis, the motions judge did not address the <i>CCAA </i>issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aon
    and Norton appeal.  The Slater Personnel bring a motion to quash the appeals,
    contending that the Orders are decisions made under the <i>CCAA</i> and,
    thus, leave to appeal the Orders is necessary.  They submit that as Aon and
    Norton did not seek leave to appeal the Orders, the appeals are not properly
    before this Court and should be quashed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the motion to quash and allow the
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE ISSUES </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    effect, the motion judge struck the Proposed Third Party Claims on the basis
    that they failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action.  Consequently,
    to decide these appeals, two issues must be addressed:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>1.  Do the Proposed Third Party Claims disclose a reasonable cause of
    action?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>2.  If so, are they precluded by the <i>CCAA </i>orders?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE PROPOSED THIRD PARTY
      CLAIMS  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute about the principles that apply on a motion to strike pleadings
    for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(b)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  The claim
    is to be read generously, with allowance for inadequacies in drafting; the
    material facts pleaded are to be taken as true unless they are patently ridiculous
    or incapable of proof; and, the threshold is a high one as pleadings are
    to be struck only in the clearest of cases.  Put another way, for the Proposed
    Third Party Claims to be struck on the basis they did not disclose a reasonable
    cause of action, the motions judge had to have concluded that it was “plain,

    and Norton can be held liable in the Morneau action only if they are found

    Norton caused the Plans to suffer damage, the court must find that Slater<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    and Norton have defended the Morneau action on the basis that Slater did
    not rely on their advice.  That is, Aon and Norton defend on the basis that
    even if they were negligent in the preparation of the actuarial reports,
    it was not their negligence which caused damage.  Rather, it was the improper
    actions of Slater that caused the Plans to suffer harm.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    Aon and Norton succeed in convincing the court that Slater did not rely on
    their advice when deciding how much to contribute to the Plans, reasonable
    reliance on the part of the Slater will not be established.  If there is
    no reasonable reliance, there can be no loss as a consequence of the advice,
    even if the advice is found to have fallen below the requisite standard.  The
    Morneau action would fail and there would be no liability on the part of
    Aon and Norton.  If there is no liability on the part of Aon and Norton,
    there is no basis on which to seek a finding of concurrent liability on the
    part of the Slater Personnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    however, there was reasonable reliance on the part of the Slater, then the
    Proposed Third Party Claims cannot succeed.  That is because the Proposed
    Third Party Claims are based on the allegation that the Slater Personnel
    caused the damage.  It is not possible to find both that Slater reasonably
    relied on Aon and Norton’s advice and that Slater caused the damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    the Proposed Third Party Claims were not proper claims for contribution and
    indemnity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge erred in assuming that in order for the Morneau action to succeed,
    reasonable reliance on the part of Slater must be proven.  The erroneous
    assumption flows from a failure to distinguish between Morneau’s role as
    a successor administrator and Slater’s role as the Plans’ administrator,
    and to understand the true nature of the claims asserted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    Slater had sued Aon and Norton, depending on the nature of the claim asserted,
    reasonable reliance might have been necessary for success.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  But, it is not Slater that is suing.  It is Morneau
    that is suing.  Morneau may, as the successor plan administrator, pursue
    any claims that Slater might have taken.  In addition, however, Morneau has
    the right to bring suit on behalf of the Plans’ beneficiaries.  Fundamentally,
    it is the latter which lies at the heart of the Morneau claim.  The Morneau
    claim is asserted on behalf of the Plans’ members and beneficiaries, the
    people who suffered or will suffer as a result of the underfunding of the
    Plans due to the allegedly negligent preparation of the solvency valuations.  The
    success of the Morneau claim is not dependent on establishing that Slater
    reasonably relied on the reports.  It is dependent on establishing that the
    allegedly negligent reports played a role in enabling Slater to avoid making
    the required payments.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as the successor administrator, Morneau may sue for redress for acts of improper
    administration by a prior administrator much in the same way that a subsequent
    trustee can sue a prior trustee for breach of trust.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the absence of reasonable reliance is not a complete defence to the Morneau
    action which asserts a number of other claims, including breach of fiduciary
    and statutory duties.  If relevant at all, reliance is not determinative
    of those claims.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    it cannot be said that it is plain and obvious that the Proposed Third Party
    Claims could not succeed; the cross-motion to strike the claims on that basis
    must be dismissed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE IMPACT OF THE <i>CCAA </i>ORDERS<i>  </i></b>         <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    para. 15 and, thus, are not barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the stay imposed under the <i>CCAA </i>Orders applies, the court’s discretion
    should be exercised and the stay lifted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><i>            The Proposed
        Third Party Claims May Not be Barred</i></b>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    15 of the Termination Order protects the directors and officers from claims
    arising from their service as directors and officers.  In the Proposed Third
    Party Claims, the Slater Personnel are not being sued in their capacity as
    directors and officers of Slater.  Rather, the claims are made against them
    as individuals, in their capacity as agents and employees of Slater <i>qua </i>administrator.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Slater Personnel argue that they served on the Audit Committee because they
    were directors and officers.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  That may be so.  However, this argument fails
    to account for the change in role that took place when the members of the
    Audit Committee administered the Plans.  At that point, the Audit Committee
    became the agents and employees of the then-administrator of the Plans, Slater.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing
    the different roles that the Slater Personnel fulfilled while on the Audit
    Committee makes sense of the inherent conflict of interest that otherwise
    existed for them.  Here is one example of the conflict of interest that would
    exist if these different roles are conflated.  The Audit Committee had to
    decide how much money Slater would contribute to the Plans annually.  If
    the Slater Personnel, in the guise of the Audit Committee, made that decision
    in their capacity as directors or officers of Slater, they did so while owing
    a duty to Slater.  Given the financial difficulties that Slater faced, that
    duty would have led them to minimize the amount that Slater contributed to
    the Plans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when the Audit Committee made decisions on the quantum of Slater’s contribution
    to the Plans, it did so in order to fulfill Slater’s obligations as administrator
    of the Plans.  An administrator owes a fiduciary duty to the members of the
    Plans.  The Audit Committee “stood in the shoes” of Slater <i>qua </i>administrator
    when making the decision; therefore, it too owed a fiduciary duty to the
    Plans’ members.  Fulfillment of that duty would have led to maximizing the
    contributions that Slater would make to the Plans as that would best protect
    the Plans members’ pensions.  In light of Slater’s precarious financial position
    -- a fact that was known or ought to have been known by the Slater Personnel
    -- this duty was heightened because the need for solvency funding should
    have been apparent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the Slater Personnel are treated solely as directors and officers, they were
    in an impossible position.  They could not fulfill their duties both to Slater
    and to the Plans’ members.  That impossibility is obviated if the roles played
    by the Slater Personnel are kept separate.  Viewed in this way, although
    the Slater Personnel were appointed to the Audit Committee by virtue of their
    positions as directors and officers, when making decisions in respect of
    the Plans’ administration they did so as agents and employees of Slater <i>qua </i>administrator – not
    as directors and officers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the Proposed Third Party Claims would not be barred by the <i>CCAA </i>orders
    because those claims do not relate to the Slater Personnel in their roles
    of directors and officers but, rather, as individuals who were the agents
    and employees of Slater, the Plans’ administrator.  Consequently, leave would
    not be necessary to bring the Proposed Third Party Claims and there would
    be no need to lift the stay.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    comments are not intended to be determinative of this issue.  They are offered
    only to explain why I do not view the Proposed Third Party Claims as necessarily
    within the scope of para. 15 of the Termination Order.    <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b><i>A Majority

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall
    the “carve-out” in para. 15 of the Termination Order, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…this paragraph shall not extend to any person
    that actively and knowingly participated in the breach of any related fiduciary
    duties or has been grossly negligent or guilty of wilful misconduct ….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    can be seen that the carve-out provides that the release in para. 15 does
    not extend to claims against those who “actively and knowingly” participated
    in the breach of fiduciary duties or who had been grossly negligent or guilty
    of wilful misconduct.  Many of the allegations in the Proposed Third Party
    Claims fall within the scope of the carve-out.  Consequently, even if the
    stay otherwise operates, it does not preclude such claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b><i>Lifting  the
        Stay if  Necessary</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    and in any event, I would lift the stay if that were necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Slater Personnel acknowledge that even if the <i>CCAA </i>orders otherwise
    prevent the Proposed Third Party Claims from being initiated, para. 16 of
    the Termination Order gives this court the power to lift the stay and allow
    the claims to proceed.  They argue that the court should not exercise its
    discretion because:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1.  the allegations in the
    Proposed Third Party Claims are frivolous, without merit and do not establish
    a <i>prima facie </i>case, and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2.  since Slater no longer
    exists, the directors and officers cannot seek indemnity from it.  Whatever
    claims the directors and officers might have against Slater if the Proposed
    Third Party Claims are permitted to proceed, in effect, those claims are
    foreclosed as a result of the <i>CCAA</i> orders and the liquidation of Slater’s
    assets.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no merit in the first objection.  As the material facts pleaded in the
    Proposed Third Party Claims are neither patently ridiculous nor incapable
    of proof, at this stage they are taken to be true.  On that basis, the claims
    for indemnity and contribution cannot be said to be frivolous or without
    merit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second objection is founded on the prejudice that the Slater Personnel may
    suffer if the stay is lifted.  In my view, in considering this objection,
    the court must balance that prejudice against the prejudice that Aon and
    Norton may suffer if the stay is not lifted.  A weighing of such prejudice
    leads me to conclude that the balance is in favour of Aon and Norton and,
    therefore, in favour of lifting the stay, if that is necessary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the stay is lifted, the Slater Personnel will face significant financial
    exposure for conduct that occurred while they were directors and officers
    of Slater or its affiliates.  If they are found liable, they will be unable
    to seek redress from Slater.  On the other hand, Aon and Norton face significant
    financial exposure in the Morneau action.  If the stay is not lifted, they
    will be unable to claim against the very individuals they say caused or contributed
    to the damages for which they may be held liable in the Morneau action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the analysis of prejudice ended there, one might conclude that the balance
    is roughly even.  That, however, would be to ignore the legal proceedings
    which bring the parties to this point.  The Slater Personnel fully participated
    in the proceedings that now prevent them from looking to Slater for indemnification.  Their
    interests were protected and their voices heard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same is not true for Aon and Norton.  Morneau brought its action against
    Aon and Norton almost fifteen months after the Termination Order was issued.  Aon
    and Norton had no notice of the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings and no opportunity
    to make submissions in respect of the <i>CCAA </i>Orders.  They had no knowledge,
    or means of acquiring knowledge, of any possible claims against them and
    no ability to assert a D&amp;O Claim.  Unlike the Slater Personnel, they
    were not involved in the FSCO Settlement nor were they given the opportunity
    to be involved in that process.  If the stay is not lifted, Aon and Norton
    face substantial liability for which they may not claim contribution and
    indemnity from the very persons whom they say caused the Plans’ deficits.  Their
    legitimate claims will have been barred by a process in which they never
    had the opportunity to participate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, as I have said, the balance is in favour of Aon and Norton.  Accordingly,
    I would lift the stay, if that is necessary.            </p>

    and Norton also argue that if the <i>CCAA </i>Orders purport to bar actions
    against the Slater Personnel, they ought to be held to beyond the jurisdiction
    of the court because the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings were terminated and no proposal
    or compromise had been sanctioned.  In light of the conclusions reached above,

    to its Notice of Motion.  Having said that, Aon and Norton may advance any
    legal ground available to them – they are not limited to those that fall
