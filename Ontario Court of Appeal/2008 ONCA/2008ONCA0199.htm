  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was tried by a jury on an indictment that contained counts of attempted
    murder and breach of probation.  During final instructions, the trial judge
    withdrew the count of breach of probation from the jury’s consideration and
    left them to decide only whether the allegation of attempted murder had been
    proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jurors found the appellant not guilty
    of attempted murder, but guilty of aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the pre-charge conference, the prosecutor, defence counsel and trial judge
    were of one mind that the appellant’s claim of self-defence rested exclusively
    on the provisions of s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.  In particular,
    the trial principals were unanimous that s. 34(1) did not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    inadvertence, the parties’ agreement about the applicable basis of self-defence
    did not make its way into the final instructions.  Instead of leaving self-defence
    to be decided under s. 34(2) as everyone had agreed, the trial judge instructed
    the jury on self-defence under s. 34(1), a provision that everyone agreed
    had no application on the evidence adduced at trial.  To compound the problem,
    no one realized the error, thus no correction was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    commendable frankness, Crown counsel has acknowledged that the submission
    of s. 34(1) to the jury as the sole basis for self-defence, rather than s.
    34(2), together with a failure to draw the jury’s attention to certain evidence
    of importance under s. 34(2) but not under s. 34(1), constitutes legal error
    sufficiently serious to warrant a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the only basis of self-defence for which the evidence adduced
    at trial afforded an air of reality was under s. 34(2).  The inadvertent
    failure of the trial judge to instruct on that subsection left the claim
    of self-defence to be adjudicated on the basis of s. 34(1) for which the
    evidence furnished no air of reality.  The appellant was entitled to but
    did not obtain an adjudication of his claim of self-defence upon a proper
    legal basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we would allow the appeal from, and set aside the conviction
    for, aggravated assault.  In the absence of an appeal from the appellant’s
    acquittal of attempted murder, the new trial will be held on a charge of
    aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further says that his conviction of breach of probation is fatally
    flawed because it was entered after the jury had returned its verdict on
    the main count, attempted murder, and was recorded by the trial judge himself,
    not by the jury as it should have been.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arraigned on two counts in an indictment, attempted murder
    and breach of probation.  A jury was selected and the appellant given into
    their charge on both counts.  Apart from some trial event that took the appellant
    out of the jury’s charge, for example a change of plea or entry of a stay
    of proceedings by the prosecutor under s. 579(1) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> on
    the breach of probation count, or declaration of a mistrial, the appellant
    was entitled to the jury’s verdict on the breach of probation count every
    bit as much as he was entitled to their decision on the count of attempted
    murder.  Despite the concurrence of counsel to the procedure adopted in default
    of other procedural steps not taken here, the trial judge had no authority
    to take the second count away from the jury and later to record a conviction
    for breach of probation as the trier of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be open to debate whether what occurred here was a procedural irregularity
    forgiven, in the absence of prejudice, by s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.  But
    Crown counsel does not seek to sustain the conviction for breach of probation
    in the circumstances, whether through the invocation of the procedural proviso
    or otherwise.  The conviction for breach of probation was made without jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from conviction for breach of probation is allowed, the conviction
    set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
