    events occurred at a small party in a hotel room that at least ten young
    men and women attended, including the complainant, the appellants, and two
    of their friends, brothers A.S. and J.S. The complainant and her female friends
    arrived at the party at around 10:30 p.m. The complainant’s female friends
    left by 3:30 a.m., but the complainant stayed.  During the evening the complainant
    drank liquor and ingested some drugs. She has no memory of engaging in sexual
    intercourse or any other events at the party after 3:30 a.m., except for
    a flash of J.R.’s face. She awoke at around 10:00 a.m., alone in the hotel
    room, lying naked on the bathroom floor. In the weeks following the party,
    the complainant had begun to piece together what happened to her and believed
    that the appellants had assaulted her. Some months later, DNA test results
    from a vaginal swab of the complainant taken during the afternoon following
    the party indicated the presence of semen from each of the two appellants,
    as well as an unknown third man. Before the DNA results were known, the complainant
    and a friend of hers had confronted the appellant J.D. J.R. heard that he
    was a suspect through rumours within a few days of the party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellants defended on the basis that the Crown did not prove that the complainant
    did not consent to intercourse. The appellant J.R., who testified at the
    trial, also raised the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.
    J.R. appeals his conviction on the following grounds: (1) that the trial
    judge applied a lower standard of scrutiny to the defence evidence than to
    the Crown evidence; (2) that the trial judge failed to give meaningful reasons
    for accepting the evidence of the complainant; (3) that the trial judge misapprehended
    the evidence regarding the complainant’s level of intoxication; (4) that
    the verdict was unreasonable; (5) that the trial judge misapplied the burden
    of proof and the rule in <i>R. v. W.(D.) </i>(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.)<i>. </i>The
    appellant J.D. did not testify at the trial. On the appeal, he joined in
    and amplified the arguments made on behalf of J.R. to the extent applicable,
    and also objected that the trial judge failed to consider the issue of consent
    separately for him. I reject each of these grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making the argument that the trial judge applied a more rigorous standard
    of scrutiny to the defence witnesses than to the complainant, the appellant
    J.R. has detailed aspects of the evidence of each witness and asks the court
    to find the defence witnesses credible and the complainant’s account implausible.
    He challenges the trial judge’s findings of credibility and the logic or
    basis for those findings, effectively asking this court to make its own findings
    or to find that the trial judge erred in his conclusions. In <i>R. v. Howe</i> (2005),
    192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 at para. 59, this court stated the test for succeeding
    on a claim that a trial judge unfairly employed different standards in assessing
    credibility as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[t]he appellant
    must point to something in the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere
    in the record that make it clear that the trial judge had applied different
    standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave three reasons for rejecting the evidence of the appellant
    J.R. First, he did not believe that the appellant did not remember details
    of the sexual encounter. The trial judge found J.R. to be an evasive witness
    whose memory was “conveniently sketchy.” Although he was drinking that night
    and time had passed since the incident, because he knew within days that
    he was being accused of sexual assault, he would have had a
    “powerful motive to remember the details he knew then.” Second, if the intercourse
    occurred in the way the appellant described it at trial, with a lot of activity
    and different positions, he would have had no doubt that the complainant
    was consenting. Yet J.R. told police, effectively, “I don’t know, maybe I
    was wrong.” Third, there were numerous other contradictions between J.R.’s
    evidence and that of his two friends, A.S. and J.S., with respect to details
    of the party, such as their locations at different times, how and when J.R.
    was given the money to pay for the hotel room, and the times at which various
    people departed. These reasons are cogent and it was open to the trial judge
    to adopt them in considering the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant J.R. argued, relying on <i>R. v. Esau </i>(1997)<i>,</i> 116 C.C.C.
    (3d) 289 at para. 24, that it was an error of law for the trial judge to
    find that his comment to the police, “maybe I was wrong”, was a damning statement
    that was inconsistent with a belief in consent. However, when asked at trial
    why he said that to police, J.R. did not say that he may have been mistaken
    about her consent, nor was that argued by trial defence counsel. There can
    be no error by the trial judge in using that statement as an inconsistency
    with the appellant’s version of events and a reason to disbelieve him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge examined the defence witness J.S.’s story in detail, including
    his excuse for failing to tell the police originally or the Crown at an earlier
    trial date that the complainant had fellated him at the party. He came forward
    with this story for the first time when he called defence counsel four years
    after the party and a few days before the actual trial. The trial judge rejected
    his story as a complete fabrication and gave six cogent reasons for doing
    so. There is also no merit to the argument that the trial judge erred by
    failing to treat as a prior consistent statement the defence witness A.S.’s
    evidence that J.S. had previously told him about the oral sex. The evidence
    was vague, it was elicited by the Crown on cross-examination, and defence
    counsel at trial placed no emphasis on it. Furthermore, although the trial
    judge found that A.S. testified in a straightforward manner, he also found
    that his reliability was undermined because he was very tired at the party,
    had drank to excess, and had passed out between 3:30 and 5:30&nbsp;a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave extensive and detailed reasons for accepting the complainant’s
    testimony. The appellant J.R. raises two specific issues that he says should
    have prompted the trial judge to reject the complainant’s evidence. The first
    is the alleged contradiction between the complainant’s stated shock about
    two months after the incident when she was told that the DNA testing established
    that the appellant J.D. was one of the men who had had sex with her at the
    party, and her accusation of him when she encountered him prior to learning
    of the test results. The appellants say that her accusation revealed that
    she was not unconscious at the time of the intercourse and her claim of shock
    two months later suggests her untruthfulness. The trial judge’s reasons dealt
    with these aspects of the evidence. He believed they did not reveal inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s story. Although the complainant had no memory of the
    early morning hours of the party, she said that in the days following the
    incident, she pieced together in her mind what must have happened and concluded
    that the two appellants must have been the ones who sexually assaulted her.
    However, when she learned the results of the DNA testing, she was still shocked
    at the confirmation that the appellant J.D., who she thought was her good
    friend, would have assaulted her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised by the appellant was the complainant’s statement that
    she would not have consented to sex with the appellant because he was black,
    and the various explanations she gave for that statement. The trial judge
    also dealt with this evidence in detail and concluded that it showed candour
    on her part rather than duplicity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge examined all of the evidence before making his findings of credibility
    regarding all of the witnesses and the parties. He gave full reasons for
    his conclusions in each case. I would not give effect to the first two grounds
    of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the complainant did not consent to intercourse
    with the two appellants. He found that she did not have the capacity to consent
    because of her intoxication, and although she had no memory of the attacks,
    he accepted that she would not have consented for the reasons she gave, including
    her recent abortion, her insistence that new sexual partners use condoms,
    her lack of sexual or romantic attraction toward either of the appellants,
    and her good friendship with the appellant J.D. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant J.R. argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence regarding
    the complainant’s level of intoxication. At one point in the written portion
    of his reasons, the trial judge found that the complainant’s blood alcohol
    level at 4 a.m. was at least 240 mg/100ml, when the only conclusion that
    the toxicological tests performed on the complainant supported beyond a reasonable
    doubt was that her blood alcohol was at least 155mg/100ml at some point during
    the evening. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, even if the trial judge erred in this finding, the error was of
    no moment. In his oral reasons for his findings, the trial judge concluded
    that over the evening, the complainant drank at least 13 ounces of rum and
    two beers, smoked marijuana, and involuntarily ingested a minor amount of
    cocaine. He concluded that as a result of her intoxication, she blacked out
    and had no memory of what happened except a brief flash at some point of
    the appellant J.R.’s face. Based on the evidence of the level of ingestion
    of alcohol and drugs together with the evidence of the complainant, the trial
    judge was entitled to make the findings that he made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant next claims that the verdict was unreasonable because there was
    no evidence of who initiated the sexual intercourse and therefore no evidence
    that it was the appellant. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
    The trial judge was entitled to find that there was sexual intercourse without
    the complainant’s consent because of her incapacity, and that the only available
    conclusion was that it was initiated by the appellants.</p>

    appellant J.R.’s final complaint is that the trial judge did not properly
    apply <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> and the burden of proof. There is no merit to this
    ground of appeal. The appellant’s complaint is based on a parsing of the
    reasons of the trial judge and his failure to repeat certain aspects of the
    evidence when he was discussing the application of <i>W.(D</i>.<i>)</i>,
    although he had dealt with the evidence when reaching his conclusions regarding
    credibility. It is not clear why the trial judge chose to give oral reasons
    supplemented by further detailed written reasons. The result was that the
    two sets of reasons and analyses overlapped to some extent. Regardless, a
    trial judge is not required to mention all of the evidence to justify each
    aspect of his analysis. The trial judge’s conclusion is clear and fully supported
    by the evidence.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant J.D. also raised the further ground that the trial judge erred
    by relying on the <i>ex post facto</i> evidence of the complainant of the
    reasons why she would not have consented to intercourse as a basis for finding
    lack of consent. The appellant relies on the following statement of Major
    J. for the majority in <i>R. v. Esau</i>, <i>supra</i> at para.&nbsp;23: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>My colleague [referring to McLachlin J.] concludes that the complainant would
    not for personal reasons have consented. This, in view of the complainant’s
    failure to remember, is no evidence of her denying consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in the present case found that because of intoxication, the complainant
    did not have the capacity to consent. He also reasoned, based on her evidence,
    that she would not have consented and he accepted that the evidence of a
    lack of struggle also supported his conclusion of the complainant’s lack
    of capacity in those circumstances. In my view, the trial judge was entitled
    to view the cumulative effect of the evidence and draw the conclusions he
    did. In <i>Esau</i>, the majority was not laying down a rule, but was instead
    discussing why it rejected the minority’s view of the value and effect of
    the evidence in that case in the context of the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief in consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant J.D. also raises other objections to the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the complainant was credible. He asserts that the complainant’s reasons
    for saying she would not have had sex with the appellant were weak and that
    the trial judge unreasonably accepted that the complainant would not have
    voluntarily taken cocaine. I do not agree. The appellant’s argument amounts
    to an invitation to this court to retry the case and make our own findings
    of credibility. As discussed above, the trial judge was entitled to make
    the findings he did based on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by treating the issue of
    consent as an all-or-nothing question and failed to consider that the complainant
    may have consented with the appellant J.D. but not with J.R. or with the
    third person whose semen was found. I do not agree. The trial judge dealt
    specifically with the evidence supporting his finding that the complainant
    did not consent to intercourse with her friend J.D. He accepted that evidence
    as part of his conclusion that she was incapacitated and therefore could
    not consent with anyone. </p>

    appellant J.D. seeks a conditional sentence or a reduction in his sentence
    on the basis that the two offenders are very different and should not have
    received the same sentence. The appellant J.R. has a criminal record consisting
    of six convictions for trespassing, failure to comply, possession of property
    obtained by crime, and possession of illegal drugs. His pre-sentence report
    stated that he possesses an attitude of sexual entitlement towards women
    and concluded that he is likely to re-offend.</p>

    appellant J.D. has no record. He is of aboriginal background and his <i>Gladue </i>report
    was very positive. He had been employed up to the time of the charges, had
    done significant volunteer work and had an excellent character reference
    from his church minister. The trial judge rejected a conditional sentence
    as inappropriate in the circumstances of this case because it would inadequately
    reflect the principles of general deterrence and denunciation. He considered
    the <i>Gladue</i> report and concluded that the objectives of restorative
    justice did not weigh more heavily in this case than those two sentencing
    principles. Finally, he considered the differences between the two offenders,
    but concluded that they did not justify a lower sentence for the appellant
    J.D. in this case. In imposing the two-year sentence, he also considered
    that the appellant was a first offender and that this would be the first
    significant jail sentence for both men.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant J.D. that in most circumstances, he should have
    received a lower sentence than his co-accused, given the significant differences
    in their antecedents, respective characters, and prospects for rehabilitation.
    However, in my view, in the circumstances of this case, where each man took
    advantage of the complainant when she was incapacitated, leaving her in a
    state where she woke up naked, helpless, and alone on the bathroom floor
    of the hotel room, the two-year sentence is at the low end of the appropriate
    range of sentence. The appellant J.R. hardly knew the appellant and took
    advantage of her, while the appellant J.D. was her good friend and did the
    same thing. Both engaged in reprehensible criminal conduct. In these circumstances,
    there is no basis to impose a lower sentence than two years on the appellant
    J.D. I also note that he does not seek the one day reduction that the Crown
    has agreed will be accorded to the appellant J.R.</p>

    J.R. will be reduced by one day to two years less a day; (2) leave to appeal
