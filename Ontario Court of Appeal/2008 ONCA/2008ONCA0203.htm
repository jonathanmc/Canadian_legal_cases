  <h3>Nature of Appeal </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and his brother are co-beneficiaries of the estate of his mother
    Lillian Helen Painter.  Glithero J. dismissed the appellant’s application,
    which, although styled as a Rule 76 motion for directions, proceeded on consent
    as an application for substantive relief.  The appellant appeals all the
    matters raised in his application. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Issues</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'> </span></h3>
  <h3>1.         Did the application judge err in failing to order the estate
    trustee to pass accounts of the estate?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge properly determined that the ongoing disputes between the
    brothers prevented the realization and distribution of many of the assets
    of the estate.  Although the appellant agrees that the application judge
    had a discretion to refuse to order a passing of accounts, he submits that
    the discretion was not properly exercised.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is evident where most of the liquid assets of the estate have gone.  The
    application judge’s decision was reasonable and was no doubt intended to
    avoid further costs respecting this modest estate.  It is not for us to second
    guess his exercise of discretion.</p>
  <h3>2.         Did the application judge err in finding that appellant was
    not the 100% beneficial owner of the two joint bank accounts?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the application judge erred in stating that the appellant’s
    position was that his mother had given him the money that was in the joint
    accounts.  Earlier, the application judge had correctly stated, in para.
    33 of his reasons, that the appellant’s position was that he had put all
    the money into the accounts.  The appellant seeks the trial of an issue respecting
    the joint bank accounts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that to the extent he asserts ownership of assets
    owned jointly with the deceased, s. 13 of the <i>Evidence Act</i> requires
    independent corroboration.  There was none before the application judge.  The
    evidence adduced by the appellant was not corroborated by any evidence independent
    of himself (such as banking records of deposits).   In the result, therefore,
    the application judge was correct in his conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    us, the appellant says that he provided independent proof to the estate trustee
    of his ownership but that this was not in the application record.  The appellant,
    a former lawyer, represented himself before Glithero J., and now wants an
    opportunity to present that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, we have no evidence filed by way of an application to admit
    fresh evidence respecting independent evidence.  Accordingly there is no
    basis on which we can interfere. </p>
  <h3>3.         Did the application judge err in failing to order release of
    appellant’s personal goods from
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    King George Road?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    undisputed evidence was that some of the personal goods located at property
    belonging to the estate trustee belonged to the appellant.  The estate trustee
    did not oppose the removal of these goods.  The trial judge’s order dismissed
    the relief requested as being unnecessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges that the estate trustee now opposes the appellant receiving
    his share of personal effects.  In our opinion, the appropriate remedy is
    for the appellant to go back to the application judge with a view to resolving
    this matter.  Any issue respecting what constitutes the personal goods should
    be left to the application judge or the trial of an issue.  Accordingly,
    we would amend paragraph 3(i) of the order by adding to it: “without prejudice
    to the applicant to seek further direction from the application judge if
    necessary.”</p>
  <h3>4.         Did the application judge err in failing to order the release
    of an expired PPSA registration?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no error on the part of the application judge on this issue and there
    is no order from which the appellant can appeal.    </p>
  <h3>5.         Did the application judge err in awarding partial indemnity
    costs against Appellant?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing costs, the application judge noted: that the order for a trial
    of an issue was as a result of information advanced by the appellant for
    the first time in oral argument; that the proceedings were unduly complex;
    and that all previous offers would have been highly beneficial to the appellant
    as he would have obtained shares to the company 375 and ownership and control
    of Cedarland.  The application judge accounted for Rule 57 factors, Rule
    49 offers to settle and the conduct of the parties, including the conduct
    of the appellant who was attempting to re-litigate matters already decided.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    was within the application judge’s discretion to refuse to award costs to
    the appellant out of the estate and his order was not plainly wrong. </p>
  <h3>Costs of the Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch
    as the estate trustee and Grant have the same interest on this appeal, the
    costs of this appeal are fixed in the amount of $10,000 to be divided between
    the estate trustee and Grant as they see fit and are to be paid within 30
    days.  The appellant is to reimburse the estate in the same amount within
    the same 30 days. </p>
