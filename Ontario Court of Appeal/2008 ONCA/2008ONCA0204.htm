    appellant advances two grounds of appeal against conviction.  Each asserts
    error in the charge to the jury.  We would give effect to neither.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of appeal has to do with the judge’s instructions about the
    use the jurors could make of evidence of the results of forensic DNA analysis
    of bodily substances found on a black scarf found near the premises robbed.  To
    be more specific, the appellant contends that the jurors should have been
    told that before they could consider the expert opinion that the appellant
    was the source of the bodily substances found on the scarf, they had to be
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the scarf found was that worn by
    the robber.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that, as a general rule, the criminal standard of
    proof applies to the evidence as a whole, not to individual items of evidence
    relied upon by the prosecutor.  See <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1988), 44 C.C.C.
    (3d) 193 at 211 per Sopinka J.  We see no reason to depart from that basic
    principle in this case.  To insist upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
    the identity of the scarf found with that worn by the robber, as a condition
    precedent to jury use of the results of forensic DNA analysis of the bodily
    substances, or indeed of the scarf itself as a piece of real evidence, is
    to impose a threshold that is inconsistent with <i>Morin</i> and incompatible
    with the function of the trier of fact in cases involving circumstantial
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances a second ground of appeal.  He contends that the trial
    judge’s instructions on the use that jurors could make of the appellant’s
    criminal record were flawed.  In his instructions to the jury about the limitations
    the law imposes on the jurors’ use of the prior criminal convictions acknowledged
    by the appellant in his testimony, the trial judge pointed out that convictions
    for crimes involving dishonesty may have a greater impact on the appellant’s
    credibility than convictions for certain other offences, like assault and
    impaired driving.  The appellant says that the trial judge should have gone
    further and told the jury, in addition to the usual prohibited use instruction
    (inferring guilt from evidence of bad character) that the dishonesty references
    had to do with testimonial reliability only, not dishonest behaviour such
    as that alleged.  The prohibited use instructions, he says, should have been
    linked specifically to crimes of dishonesty so that the jurors would not
    infer commission of the crime of dishonesty charged from the appellant’s
    prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this complaint.  The jury was plainly told:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One thing you must not do is use the criminal record
    of the accused to conclude that he is a bad person and therefore more than
    likely to have committed the crimes he is accused of at this trial.  A criminal
    record can be used as a factor in assessing his credibility only and not
    for any other purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s criminal record included several crimes of dishonesty, none of
    which were identical to the offences charged.  The prohibited chain of reasoning
    was made plain.  It related to <i>all</i> the appellant’s convictions, including
    those of dishonesty.  No further instruction was requested and none was required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
