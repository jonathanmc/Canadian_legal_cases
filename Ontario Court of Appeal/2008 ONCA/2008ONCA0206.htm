    a trial before Chester J., the appellant was convicted of criminal harassment,
    assault, and breach of a probation order. In addition to credit of 414 days
    for pre-sentence custody, the appellant was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment
    for criminal harassment; to three years’
    imprisonment to be served concurrently for assault; and to one year of imprisonment
    to be served consecutively for breach of probation. In addition, under s.
    743.6 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge ordered that the appellant
    not be entitled to parole until he has served one half of his sentence. The
    appellant appeals from the convictions and seeks leave to appeal sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises two main issues on his conviction appeal. First, the appellant
    says that the trial judge erred in holding that the elements of criminal
    harassment were proven. He relies primarily on the fact that the charge arose
    from a single incident and says that the evidence did not establish the necessary
    ongoing aspect of criminal harassment. The appellant also points out that
    the trial judge failed to make findings concerning all of the elements of
    the offence. I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Kosikar</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 217 at paras. 15 and 25, this court
      held that a single incident of threatening conduct can found a conviction
      for criminal harassment if, in the circumstances, “the consequence is that
      the complainant is being harassed.”
    Goudge J.A., writing for the court, said, “while being in a harassed state
    involves a sense of being subject to ongoing torment, a single incident in
    the right context can surely cause this feeling.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Kosikar</i>,
    evidence of prior contact between the accused and the complainant was used
    to show that as the consequence of a letter the complainant felt harassed.
    However, Goudge J.A. also stated, “it is possible to imagine a case where
    the complainant’s feeling harassed would be proven … by evidence of a single
    incident that carried the real future prospect of the continuing tormenting
    of the complainant.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the facts of this case, in my view, it was open to the trial judge to find
    that the complainant was harassed both because the appellant's behaviour
    during the incident was persistent and because the incident occurred while
    the appellant was subject to a probation order requiring that he have no
    contact with the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial indicated that the complainant’s twelve-year-old son became
    frightened while alone in the basement of the complainant’s home when he
    noticed the appellant tapping on the basement window. After being told at
    the front door of the home that the complainant did not want to speak to
    him, the appellant tried to break into the house. <span
lang=EN-GB>When the</span> complainant left the house with her son, the appellant
    pursued them. After catching up with the complainant, the appellant blocked
    her way by circling around her. When the complainant tried to call 9-1-1,
    the appellant grabbed the telephone from her hands and punched her in the
    arm. When the complainant followed her son to a variety store, the appellant
    followed after them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the complainant allowed the appellant to live with her during a period shortly
    before the incident, the appellant was, nonetheless, subject to a probation
    order requiring that he have no contact with her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge made explicit
    findings concerning whether the complainant was harassed and concerning whether
    the appellant knew the complainant was harassed. However, the trial judge’s
    reasons appear to be a response to the issues raised by defence counsel at
    trial (not Mr. Koziebrocki) and he made a specific finding that the appellant's
    conduct “was such as to cause [the complainant] to fear for her safety.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    finding that the complainant feared for her safety was available on the evidence,
    as was the trial judge’s implicit conclusion that the complainant’s fear
    was reasonable. In the light of this finding and the circumstances of the
    incident, in my opinion, the trial judge made no error in concluding that
    all of the elements of the offence were proven. Particularly given the appellant’s
    persistence in the face of the probation order, the complainant’s fears would
    relate naturally to the prospect of ongoing torment, a fact that must have
    been obvious to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting the complainant’s
    out-of-court statement to the police officer as past recollection recorded
    and in relying on that evidence as the sole basis for a conviction on the
    assault charge. I would not accept these submissions. The trial judge provided
    careful reasons for holding that each of the elements of the test for admissibility
    of this evidence was satisfied. Having admitted the evidence, it was open
    to the trial judge to rely on it. I see no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge's decisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>The Sentence Appeal</u></b><b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the sentence appeal must be allowed. Taking account of pre-sentence
    custody, the appellant received an effective sentence of six years and forty-nine
    days imprisonment for the criminal harassment and assault charges, plus one
    year of imprisonment for the breach of probation charge. The total effective
    sentence is therefore seven years and forty-nine days. In my view, this sentence
    is both disproportionate to the conduct underlying these offences and outside
    the range of what is appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
 <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave cogent reasons for imposing a heavy sentence on the appellant.
    In particular, I agree with the trial judge’s conclusions that the appellant’s
    lengthy criminal record demonstrates both that he is an incorrigible offender
    who flouts court orders and that “he has evolved into a ... predator of needy
    women”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant's criminal record includes forty-seven convictions for what the
    trial judge described as crimes against the administration of justice: <i>e.g.</i> breaches
    of court orders and recognizances, failing to appear, obstruct justice, and
    driving while disqualified. In addition, the appellant’s criminal record,
    which includes a conviction for criminal harassment, and the pre-sentence
    report fully support the trial judge’s conclusions that the appellant has
    a history of preying on vulnerable women and of committing crimes against
    women. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    these circumstances, protection of the public, denunciation and general deterrence
    were the paramount sentencing goals and they demanded a significant sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    at trial, the Crown proposed a sentencing range of five to eight years in
    the penitentiary for the criminal harassment charge. The main authorities
    on which the Crown relied to justify this range were <i>R. v. Bates</i>,
    (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Finnessey </i>(2000), 135 O.A.C. 396 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). In my view, neither of these decisions supports a sentencing range of
    five to eight years’ imprisonment for the criminal harassment count in this
    case. Further, no additional authorities have been provided on appeal that
    would support such a range. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Bates</i>,
    on a Crown appeal, this court imposed an effective sentence of thirty months’ imprisonment
    for eleven offences, including criminal harassment, uttering a death threat,
    and multiple counts of assault and failing to comply. Although the accused
    in <i>Bates </i>pleaded guilty to most of the charges and had only a relatively
    minor and unrelated record, the aggravating factors included an escalating
    pattern of harassment over more than three months and breaches of recognizance
    during that period. As noted, the thirty month sentence encompassed multiple
    offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Finnessey</i>,
    on a Crown appeal, this court imposed an effective sentence of four years’ imprisonment
    for various offences, including break and enter, criminal harassment and
    threatening a police officer. Although the accused pleaded guilty and his
    conduct did not involve any physical violence, the pattern of harassment
    continued for fifteen months following the initial break-in of the complainant's
    home. It included death threats and subsequent break-ins when the complainant
    was not home. Moreover, the accused had a significant criminal record involving
    thirty-six prior convictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taking
      account of the sentences imposed in <i>Bates</i> and <i>Finnessey</i>,
      the circumstances of this case, and the principles of sentencing, including
      totality, I consider that a fit sentence would be thirty months’ imprisonment
      in addition to 414 days’ credit for pre-sentence custody on the criminal
      harassment charge; twelve months’ imprisonment concurrent on the assault
      charge; and twelve months’
    imprisonment consecutive on the breach of probation charge. This amounts
    to a total effective sentence in excess of four and a half years’ imprisonment. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentence imposed on the criminal harassment charge should not be viewed
      as establishing an outer limit of three and a half years’ imprisonment
      for serial harassers. Although the circumstances of this case are serious
      and the appellant has a lengthy criminal record, the facts underlying the
      criminal harassment charge arise from a single incident. Moreover, the
      appellant had never been sentenced previously to the penitentiary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the light of the reduction in the appellant</span>’<span lang=EN-US>s sentence
      and the fact that, in addition to pre-sentence custody, he has served a
      little over 22 months’ imprisonment, I need not deal with his appeal relating
      to the order made under s. 743.6 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
