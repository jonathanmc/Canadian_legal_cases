    plaintiffs in this action obtained a Mareva injunction against Conrad Black
    and Barbara Amiel-Black.  The motion judge made a protective order sealing
    the motion material making it unavailable to the public.  Bell Globemedia
    Publishing Inc. (“the Globe”) moved to intervene to set aside the protective
    order.  The motion judge dismissed the Globe’s motion.  The Globe appeals. </p>

    have changed since the motion judge’s decision, and the Globe could bring
    a new motion to set aside the protective order.  Events may have largely
    eclipsed the dispute, but the appeal is not moot.  The Globe has proceeded
    with the appeal rather than bringing a new motion, it explains, to ensure
    the motion judge’s decision, which it regards as wrong, does not influence
    the jurisprudence in this area.</p>

    appeal, set aside the dismissal of the Globe’s motion, and replace it with
    an order granting the Globe intervenor status and setting aside the protective

    motion judge was case managing the action of the plaintiffs (referred to
    collectively as “Hollinger”) against the Blacks and others.  At the time,
    Mr. Black was facing a number of highly publicized criminal charges in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    August 18, 2006, the motion judge made two orders on motions brought by Hollinger
    without notice to the Blacks.  In the first order, the motion judge granted
    a Mareva injunction against the Blacks freezing their assets worldwide.  Hollinger
    was required to give notice to the Blacks and then apply to have the order
    confirmed within ten days.  The order contained a term that “the Motion Record,
    the Affidavits filed and this Order shall remain sealed until the return
    of this motion [after service of the order on the Blacks]”.  The parties
    refer to this term as the
    “sealing order”.  In the second order, the motion judge ordered “that the
    Motion material is hereby subject to a protective Order, subject to further
    Order of this court.”  The parties refer to this as the “protective order”.  </p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the Blacks received notice of the Mareva order, they brought a motion to
    set it aside.  Their motion and Hollinger’s motion to continue the Mareva
    order were both scheduled to be heard on September 29, 2006.  The motion
    judge made an interim order on August 29, 2006 continuing both the Mareva
    order and the protective order to September 29, 2006.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 30, 2006 the Globe learned about the August 18, 2006 orders.  It filed
    a motion seeking: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1)        intervenor
    status for the purpose of challenging the sealing and protective orders; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2)        permission
    to have its counsel and Deputy Editor, upon giving appropriate confidentiality
    undertakings to the court, review the sealed material in order to provide
    and receive instructions and to permit counsel to make informed submissions
    on its motion; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    to vary the sealing orders so that they limited public access to the motion
    material to the minimal extent possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The
    Globe’s motion, originally returnable September 26, was also adjourned to
    September 29, 2006 to be heard along with the motions of Hollinger and the
    Blacks.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    all three motions came before the court, counsel for Hollinger and the Blacks
    advised that they had entered into what they called a Confidential Settlement
    Agreement.  At their request, the court made an order on consent restraining
    the Blacks from dealing with their assets “except as provided by the Confidential
    Settlement Agreement”.  Evidently, the agreement itself was not filed with
    the court.  The Blacks withdrew their motion.</p>

    the consent order was made, the sealing order lapsed, but the protective
    order continued.  The sealing order was part of the original Mareva order
    that had provided that it would remain in effect only “until the return of
    this motion”, so the sealing order expired with the return of the motion.  The
    protective order, however, had been issued separately and it remained in
    effect “subject to further order of this Court”. </p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p align=left style='

  <p align=left style='

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Globe argues that the motion judge arrived at the wrong conclusion on all
    three questions.  The respondents argue that the motion judge's orders to
    continue the protective order and to refuse to allow the Globe to view the
    protected material were interlocutory and should have been appealed to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  The respondents concede that the motion judge’s denial
    of intervenor status to the Globe was a final order, but submit that it was
    a discretionary decision subject to a high level of deference with which
    this court ought not to interfere.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Motion Judge’s Reasons</h3>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge indicated that after he made the consent order he still had
    two matters before him.  There was the Globe’s motion and, in addition, Hollinger
    and the Blacks sought an order that the protective order continue and be
    expanded to include the material filed in the further motions: para. 8.  He
    indicated that this request was heard along with the Globe’s motion that
    the protective order be set aside.  He characterized the issue raised by
    these two motions at para. 12 as “the exercise of the Court’s discretion
    to continue the protective Order.”</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then addressed the Globe’s request for intervenor status.  He
    noted that the Globe did not seek to participate in Hollinger’s action against
    Mr. Black generally, but merely wished to challenge the protective order.  He
    indicated that was permitted by the operation of rules 13.01 and 1.03 of
    the <i><span
lang=EN-US>Rules of Civil Procedure</span></i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  Rule
    13.01 contemplates intervenor status for a person who is not a party to the “proceeding”,
    and the definition of “proceeding” in rule 1.03 has been interpreted to include
    a motion within a proceeding.  The motion judge’s conclusion following this
    observation, however, is not entirely clear. </p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge said at para. 21 that “limited intervenor status should be granted” for
    consideration of the matters before him.  This statement could be taken to
    suggest he granted the Globe intervenor status, not in the action, but only
    for the purpose of its motion, and then went on to dismiss that motion.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    the parties framed the appeal on the basis that the motion judge refused
    the Globe’s request for intervenor status.  Perceiving ambiguity in the motion
    judge’s reasons, the respondents submitted that it was “appropriate to proceed
    on this appeal as though the appellant were denied intervenor status by the
    motions judge.”  The view taken by the parties is supported by the motion
    judge’s clear statement at para. 19, “Upon reflection, I am not satisfied
    that [the Globe] has the necessary connection to be accorded intervenor status
    to challenge the sealing order”.  He also said at paras. 18 and 19 that “[l]eave
    was given to counsel for [the Globe] to make submissions on the issue of
    the sealing order <i>as if</i> it were granted intervenor status for that
    purpose” and “it is appropriate to deal with the matter on its merits and <i>assume</i> for
    the purpose of disposing of [the Globe’s] substantive request that intervenor
    status is appropriate.” [Emphasis added.]   Moreover, his formal order referred
    to the Globe as the “proposed intervenor” and dismissed the entire Globe
    motion including the portion that requested intervenor status to challenge
    the protective order.  </p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is possible to perceive another ambiguity in the judge’s reasons.   This
    is due to the statements that bookend his main analysis.  At the beginning
    of that analysis, he remarked that the determination of the Globe’s intervenor
    request was
    “dependent on a consideration of the factors <i>referred to below</i>” [emphasis
    added].  However, he concluded the analysis with the statement,
    “<i>For the above reasons</i>, I have concluded that it is not appropriate
    at this stage to set aside the protective Order of August 18, 2006” [emphasis<i> </i>added].<i></i></p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s preface that the Globe’s motion for intervenor status was “dependent
    on<i> </i>a consideration of the factors referred to below” could be taken
    to indicate that his refusal to grant the Globe intervenor status was the
    only substantive decision he made.  On the other hand, his statement that
    he had decided not to set aside the protective order “for the above reasons” indicates
    that he turned his mind to the merits of the Globe’s motion and decided that
    the protective order should continue.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    think the parties correctly framed the appeal on the basis that the motion
    judge made a substantive decision to maintain the protective order in place.  He
    indicated at the outset that the issue before him was “the exercise of the
    Court’s discretion to continue the protective Order”.  He maintained a consistent
    focus on that issue throughout his analysis. Very little of his analysis
    is relevant to the question of the Globe’s intervenor status and all of it
    bears directly on the merits of continuing the protective order.  As well,
    the motion judge expressly stated that he had concluded not to set aside
    the protective order and his formal order dismissed the Globe’s motion to
    set it aside.  Finally, it must be remembered that Hollinger and the Blacks
    had asked the motion judge for an order to continue the protective order
    in force.  Hollinger and the Blacks’ request reflects the fact the protective
    order had originally been made in combination with an <i>ex parte</i> interim
    Mareva order that required confirmation within ten days.  The interim order
    the motion judge made on August 29 continued the protective order to September
    29 when the Globe’s motion was heard.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;

    I have proceeded with the appeal as framed by the parties on the basis that
    the motion judge made a substantive decision to continue the protective order.  I
    turn to his reasons for doing so.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge offered three principle reasons for deciding to continue the
    protective order, each under a separate heading: that the material had been
    filed <i>ex parte</i> or without notice, that Hollinger and the Blacks, as
    part of their settlement, had agreed the material should remain sealed, and
    that there was potential prejudice to Mr. Black in his criminal trial by
    self-incrimination or otherwise.  I summarize his discussion of each of these
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge stressed the fact that the protective order was made as part
    of the <i>ex parte</i> Mareva order.  Mareva orders, he noted, are generally
    made without notice.  Persons against whom they are made do not have the
    opportunity to challenge the material initially filed until the motion returns
    before the court to be confirmed.  In this case, he observed, the Blacks
    did not challenge the material that Hollinger had initially filed because
    the dispute between Hollinger and the Blacks regarding the Mareva injunction
    was withdrawn from the court by their settlement.  The motion judge concluded
    at para. 30, “it would be inappropriate, without consent of the parties to
    allow release of the material that has not been challenged in open Court.”</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then turned to the fact that Hollinger and Mr. Black, as part
    of their settlement resolving the Mareva injunction, had agreed that the
    protective order should continue.  He stated at para. 33 that the presumption
    that the court file should be open to the public continues to apply even
    though the litigants have settled the matter “unless it can be demonstrated
    that there is a particular privacy interest in the filed material or that
    it is in the interest of achieving the settlement that some or all of the
    file not be available to the public.”  As no evidence was filed, it seems
    the motion judge considered it implicit that Hollinger and the Blacks’ agreement
    that the materials should remain unavailable to the public was important
    to their ability to reach a settlement.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the <i>ex parte</i> nature of the proceeding and the settlement were factors
    considered by the judge, the main reason he decided to continue the protective
    order in force was to ensure the fairness of Mr. Black’<span lang=EN-US>s
    trial in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    evaluating this factor, the motion judge reiterated at para. 41 that the
    test for granting a sealing order is “whether the social value raised by
    the plaintiffs is one of superordinate importance to the rights of the public
    to access open court”.  He considered the two competing interests in this
    case to be “the interests of the public, represented by [the Globe], in open
    court records, and the interest of Mr. Black against testimonial compulsion
    of self-incrimination”: para. 42.  At para. 49 he repeated that the individual
    interest competing with the press’ freedom of expression was the right of
    Mr. Black under s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i> not to self-incriminate.  </p>

    motion judge stated that the party seeking a sealing order bore the onus
    of rebutting the presumption of openness and adopted the two-part <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test
    developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting
    Corp</i>., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835 and <i>R. v. Mentuck</i>, <span class=ssl2>[2001]

    motion judge noted that the Globe recognized that public access to the sealed
    material might pose a “real and substantial risk”
    to the fairness of Mr. Black’s criminal trial.  However, the Globe went on
    to argue, as the motion judge explained, that s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> “mandates
    that the Court impose on a party seeking to obtain or maintain a sealing
    order an onus to establish that the material sealed or filed would be of
    an incriminatory nature and that the Court review with detail and care that
    determination”: para. 13.  The Globe submitted that the determination whether
    the fairness of Mr. Black’s trial was in fact at risk would best be made
    on the basis of informed submissions and so its counsel should be given access
    to the material for the purposes of argument. </p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judge listed six reasons why he decided not to proceed as the Globe requested:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>1.         The
    subject of the <i>ex parte</i> Order, once served, was dealt with in open
    court, namely, the fact that there was a settlement reached by the parties
    themselves.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>2.         The
    fact of the settlement and the continuation of the original Order was made
    in a public Order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>3.         There
    was no Court proceeding at which both the Blacks and [Hollinger] were present
    and heard, which was not dealt with in public.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>4.         The
    withdrawn motion of the Blacks attacked a Court Order, which they said should
    not have been made without due notice to them and [without] the opportunity
    to make submissions on both the material and propriety of the Order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>5.         The
    continuance of the Sealing Order is time-limited and does not represent an
    adjudication of any issue in the action that could be said to be of public
    importance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    apply for further direction at an appropriate point.</p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then emphasized at para. 58 that he was exercising his discretion
    in favour of a protective order to ensure that “any material that may be
    said to be prejudicial to Mr. Black’s defence to U.S. criminal proceedings
    cannot be used against him in those proceedings.”</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge explained why he declined to embark on a document-by-document
    review of the material in order to determine if a portion of the material
    could be disclosed in order to minimize the infringement of the Globe’s freedom
    of the press.  The motion judge stated the court was aware of the criminal
    charges against Mr. Black “only in the most general way”, and neither he
    nor any other judge of the court “would be in a position to determine what
    of the material relied on by [Hollinger] for its <i>ex parte</i> Order might
    be said to be relevant or prejudicial to the defence of those charges”: paras.
    60-61.  He also observed that “settlements are to be encouraged” and noted
    the continued protection order arose from the settlement between Hollinger
    and Mr. Black.  Furthermore, a document-by-document review would be time-consuming,
    costly to both Hollinger and the Blacks, and would serve no reasonable public
    purpose “<i>at least at this time</i>”: para. 61 [emphasis in original].  The
    motion judge stated at para. 68 that if he were “to make a determination
    on what might or might not be used by a U.S. prosecutor, it would not protect
    Mr. Black's s. 13 rights under the <i>Charter</i> and might well intrude
    on judicial comity.”  The motion judge added at para. 79 that neither Hollinger
    nor the Blacks “want to or should in my view be put to the expensive process
    of review of documents that at this stage have nothing to do with the ultimate
    resolution of the claims in the action”, especially since the order was “an
    interlocutory one for a limited time period”.  He said that
    “The temporarily [sic] sealing of material that may prejudice Mr. Black in
    the defence of charges against him by disclosure of financial records or
    other activities that may be said to be related to such charges does outweigh
    at this time the deleterious effects to freedom of expression”: para. 66.</p>

    motion judge then concluded that it was not appropriate to set aside the
    protective order “at this stage” and took pains to point out at para. 82
    that “[s]hould circumstances warrant, before the hearing of the criminal
    trial of Mr. Black, the motion may be reviewed and in any event, may be reviewed

    the parts of the appeal relating to these decisions should be quashed.  The
    respondents concede the decision refusing the Globe intervenor status was
    a final one, but submit it was discretionary and deserving of deference.  The
    denial of intervenor status was appropriate, they say, because there was
    no public interest in an <i>ex parte</i> Mareva proceeding and, as a result,
    the appellant did not have any interest in the proceeding.  If the decision
    to maintain the protective order in force was reviewable in this court, the
    respondents submit it was also discretionary.  They say that discretion was
    properly exercised because the sealed material was filed on an <i>ex parte</i> motion

    in the material.</p>

    was flawed.  I consider the motion judge’s decision not to allow counsel
    to view the sealed material in order to make informed argument a procedural
    decision that was interlocutory.  That interlocutory decision is not appealable
    to this court, but courts faced with such questions may well find the Supreme

    the motion judge erred in principle in refusing to grant the Globe intervenor

    access to the court system promotes confidence in the judicial system and

    aside, but that interest was not represented.  Except for the Globe, there
    was no one, first to raise the issue whether the protective order should

    might have been less likely that he would have lost sight of the fact the

    a stronger claim to review the material for the limited purpose of making
    informed argument.  If the rights of an intervening party were at stake,
    the judge might have been persuaded to undertake a review of the material.  If

    pause to observe that the Globe might have proceeded differently. Instead
    of moving for intervenor status under Rule 13 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    the Globe might have moved to set aside the protective order under rule 37.14
    as a
    “person who…is affected by an order obtained on motion without notice”.  Newspapers
    have relied successfully on rule 37.14 to challenge sealing orders: see e.g. <i>P.S.
    v. D.C</i>. (1987), 22 C.P.C. (2d) 225 (Ont. High Court of Justice) and <i>National
    Bank of Canada v. Melnitzer</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 234 (Gen. Div.).  In
    a decision of this court, <i>Ivandaeva Total Image Salon Inc. v. Hlembizky</i> (2002),
    63 O.R. (3d) 769, Borins J.A. exhaustively reviewed the application of rule
    37.14(1).  He noted, as one example of cases in which successful motions
    under rule 37.14(1) had been brought, the
    “broad group of cases, usually arising from the sealing of a court file,
    in which the media has complained that its right to freedom of expression
    as guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> has
    been compromised and in which the principle of open and accessible court
    proceedings has been invoked”: para. 27.  Later in the judgment at para.
    38 he wrote that “it is apparent from the media cases that the courts have
    read ‘an order obtained without notice’ to mean without notice to the newspaper,
    or other media non-party, seeking to set aside a sealing order.”  </p>

    the other hand, the Globe argues that the protective order is a final order
    viewed from the Globe’s perspective as a third party uninvolved in the action
    whose motion was entirely dismissed.  The Globe says its right to have access
    to the material at the time of the motion has been finally determined.  Moreover,
    the Globe points out that the order does not, in fact, expire automatically
    once Mr. Black’s
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    indefinitely.  The Globe does recognize the order is “subject to further
    Order of this court”, but submits this phrase is superfluous as the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> would permit it to bring a motion to set aside or
    vary the order when new facts arose in any event.</p>

    appellant’s conundrum, however awkward, is not relevant to determining whether
    the protective order is final.  The order is final only if it finally determines
    the rights of the parties.  The classic statement of the difference between
    an interlocutory and final order is found in<i> Hendrickson v. Kallio</i>, [1932]
    O.R. 675 (C.A.).  Justice Middleton explained at 678 that an interlocutory
    order “does not determine the real matter in dispute between the parties – the
    very subject matter of the litigation, but only some matter collateral.  It
    may be final in the sense that it determines the very question raised by
    the application, but it is interlocutory if the merits of the case remain
    to be determined.”  On the other hand, he said a final order “determines
    the merits of the action and the real rights of the parties.”</p>

      make the same point.  Whether and how a third party is affected influences
      the characterization of an order as interlocutory or final.  Therefore,
      whether the motion judge’s order maintaining the protective order is interlocutory
      or final depends on its effect on the rights of the Globe.  </p>

    the Mareva injunction against the Blacks, issued <i>ex parte</i> and then
    continued on consent, is interlocutory.  The Globe, however, has no interest
    in the merits of Hollinger’s action or of its motion for an interlocutory
    Mareva injunction.  The Globe’s involvement is limited to its motion to set
    aside the sealing order. It is in the context of that motion that its rights
    must be determined. It is necessary to consider what was at stake for the
    Globe in the motion.</p>

    Globe in its motion did not seek a special ruling in its favour.  Ordinarily,
    the open court principle governs, and it would be unnecessary for the Globe
    to bring a motion seeking the court’s permission to have access to a court
    file.  The Globe wanted the normal state of affairs to apply and brought
    a motion to set aside the special order that had been made in favour of Mr.
    Black.  The issue the Globe raised was whether its routine right of access
    to a court file, based on its freedom of the press, had to yield to other
    interests.  In dismissing its motion, the motion judge decided that the Globe’s
    freedom of the press had to yield to Mr. Black’s individual interests in
    the circumstances.  As I see it, the protective order finally determined
    the Globe could not exercise its routine right to have access to the court
    file.  </p>

    attach no importance to the fact that the literal wording of the order makes
    it apply indefinitely.  The reasons of the motion judge make evident that
    he regarded the order as temporary.  He fully expected the order would be
    set aside at someone’s initiative after the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>

    do I attach importance to the fact the motion judge seemed to consider the
    Globe could successfully assert its right of access to the file at a later
    time.  The fact that an order has temporary application does not necessarily
    mean that it is interlocutory.  The touchstone is whether the order determines the
    real matter in dispute between the parties.  The right claimed and in issue
    in a proceeding may be the ability to do something at a particular time.  For
    example, a separated parent may bring a freestanding application to dispense
    with the other parent’s required consent to take a child out of the country
    during the summer.   In my view, a dismissal of such an application determines
    it finally, even though the parent may bring another application the following
    summer, or even later in the same summer if circumstances change.  </p>

    the context of the Globe’s motion, the potential right to have access later
    is not the same as the actual right to have access now.  The decision to
    maintain the protective order finally determined that the Globe may not exercise
    its constitutional right to freedom of the press in the circumstances that
    were before the motion judge.  A motion brought later will not revisit that

    first issue before the Supreme Court was the proper avenue for a third party
    challenge to a publication ban sought by the Crown or accused in a criminal
    proceeding.  Chief Justice Lamer rejected civil jurisdiction under the provincial
    Judicature Acts (such as the

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <span class=verdana>Ontario</span><span

    is unnecessary to review these guidelines in any detail.  What is important
    is that different procedures and different appeal routes apply to the media

    superior court should make the application for a publication ban to the trial
    judge, or if the trial judge has not yet been named, to a judge of the superior
    court.  There is no immediate right of appeal.  To seek or challenge a ban
    on appeal, both the Crown and the accused must follow the regular avenues

    starkly, at 904:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      fact, any court order made in a criminal context which affects a third
      party, including any order directed at witnesses, could likely be characterized
      as “final” from the point of view of the affected third party.  Accordingly,
      the argument can be made that a third party appeal against such an order
      would not be precluded by the principle against interlocutory criminal
      appeals and could therefore proceed by virtue of s. 40(1) of the <i>Supreme

      v. Primeau</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 60, the court explained at paras. 12-13
      why such an order would be considered final:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    for two reasons.  First, a third party, being outside the actual proceedings,
    cannot apply to the trial judge for relief. <i>Second, an order deciding

    can be seen, the criminal law treats appeals by third parties differently,
    often concluding that a matter that would be interlocutory between the parties
    alone is final with respect to third parties.  In criminal practice, a publication
    ban, even one in place temporarily until the completion of the trial, is
    a final order determining the media’s rights.  </p>

    repeat that I do not rely on the criminal law in reaching my conclusion that
    the continued protective order in this case is final.  I recognize that the

    having reached the conclusion that he did, erred by refusing to consider
    whether some portion of the material should have been made available to the

    essential point is that once the motion judge made the consent order, Mr.
    Black could no longer have any interest “against testimonial compulsion of
    self-incrimination”, if, indeed, any such compulsion existed before.  Mr.
    Black no longer had any reason to file material in response to Hollinger’s
    motion.  This leads to me to conclude that the motion judge erred by identifying
    the two <span lang=EN-US>competing interests to be balanced as “those of
    the press in freedom of expression (s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>) and those
    of Mr. Black (s. 13, the right not to self-incriminate)”.  </span></p>

    the emphasis the motion judge placed on Mr. Black’s right against self-incrimination,
    he also considered more generally the potential prejudicial effect of the
    material filed by Hollinger.  At one point he said the protective order should
    be continued “to ensure, to the extent possible, that any material that may
    be said to be prejudicial to Mr. Black’s defence to
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    criminal proceedings cannot be used against him in those proceedings.”  The
    fairness of Mr. Black’s trial was potentially a value worthy of protection
    that could conceivably outweigh the open court principle in a particular
    case.  It was, however, necessary to apply the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test

    to self-incriminate, the motion judge did not indicate why continuing the

    material produced in a civil action is generally subject to the Deemed Undertaking
    Rule, being Rule 30.1 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>”, which limits
    its use “to purposes only connected with the proceeding in which the evidence
    was obtained.”  He did not indicate that rule 30.1 applies only to evidence

    importantly, the deemed undertaking rule was not pertinent because the material
    had been filed with the court.  Rule 30.1.01(5) expressly states that the
    deemed undertaking rule does not prohibit the use, for any purpose, of evidence
    filed with the court or of evidence given or referred to during a hearing.  Moreover,
    even if the evidence had been obtained on discovery and even if it had not

    such a bald, unformulated concern as sufficient reason to seal a civil court
    file would significantly erode the open court principle and frustrate the
    public interest in the prosecution of crime.  The open availability of information
    fosters the goal of criminal and civil proceedings to ascertain the truth.  The
    fact that probative evidence becomes available to the prosecution does not,

    be able to determine what of the material “might be said to be relevant or

    he was facing unfair.  Something more than the simple assertion that prosecutor

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The “open court

    23. This principle, as the Court noted in that case, “has long been recognized
    as a cornerstone of the common law” (para. 24), and has been recognized as
    part of the law since as far back as <i>Scott v. Scott</i>, [1913] A.C. 417
    (H.L.), and <i>Ambard v. Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago</i>, [1936]
    A.C. 322 (P.C.), where Lord Atkin wrote, at p. 335: “Justice is not a cloistered
    virtue”.
    “Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion,
    and the surest of all guards against improbity” (J. H. Burton, ed., <i>Benthamiana:
    Or, Select Extracts from the Works of Jeremy Bentham</i> (1843), p. 115). </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    allows anyone who cares to know the opportunity to see “that justice is administered

    Justice seen to be done is in that way justice more likely to be done. The

    open court principle would be slender if it did not apply to documents that “have
    not been tested as to their authenticity or factual probity by [the] Court” or
    material that “has not been challenged in open Court”.  If the proposition
    were applied literally, all court files would remain sealed until the court
    issued rulings.  For example, the open court principle means that statements

    motion judge noted that the information in the sealed material would not
    be challenged because the Blacks had withdrawn their motion and so there
    was no need to consider the merits of the interim Mareva order.  Therefore,

    the exercise of the court’s authority to issue <i>ex parte</i> Mareva injunctions
    freezing individuals’
    worldwide assets without notice to them.  Whatever the documents’ ultimate
    authenticity or factual probity might be, they were the basis upon which
    the motion judge was persuaded to issue the interim Mareva injunction while
    exercising the “careful scrutiny and caution” he recognized was necessary.  The
    normal operation of the open court principle in these circumstances would
    foster public comprehension of the exercise of this extraordinary judicial
    power.  Further, in this case it is not apparent that the interim Mareva
    injunction and sealing orders were first issued in open court, and this too
    would be an aspect of the court’s functioning important for the public to
    understand.  Finally, Hollinger’s action against Mr. Black raises issues
    regarding the standards of corporate governance imposed by law, a matter
    of great significance to the public.  These are all factors relevant to the
    operation of the open court principle that should have been included in the

    begin by noting the limited nature of the settlement between Hollinger and

    about how they would deal with their assets.  Rather, the settlement called
    upon the court to exert its authority to confirm the Mareva order and restrain
    the Blacks from dealing with their assets except as permitted by the agreement.  The
    court’s jurisdiction to do so rested on the protected material Hollinger

    material might be said to be relevant or prejudicial to the defence of those
    charges.  The proper perspective should have been that all the material was
    presumptively disclosed and that the burden was on Mr. Black to satisfy the
    court as to which portions of the material should not be released.  If the
    specific nature of the charges was relevant to that determination, the onus

    open court principle is intrinsically of public importance.  It is unnecessary
    for the Globe to demonstrate that the sealing order bore on matters of public
    importance.  The onus was on the respondents to demonstrate that salutary

    routinely applied.  There was no onus on the Globe to establish that granting
    its routine right of access could be accomplished efficiently and without
    occasioning cost to the parties.  The record did not disclose any evidence

    to Mr. Black from the release of the material might be apparent on the face
    of the material itself.  The motion judge did not identify any such unfairness
    and the burden was on the respondents to demonstrate the unfairness, if it
    existed.</p>

    reasons diverge on the issue of the protective order.  While I am in agreement
    with Juriansz J.A. that the motion judge’s reasoning in respect of the protective
    order was in some respects flawed, I would leave to the Superior Court the
    determination of whether the protective order should, in whole or in part,
    remain in place.  This determination would be made with the benefit of submissions
    from the parties to this action, as well as the intervenor, and after they
    and the court have had the opportunity to review the material subject to
    the protective order.  The intervenor’s review of the material would be upon
    execution of an appropriate confidentiality undertaking.</p>

      though the motion judge refused to give the appellant intervenor status,
      he nonetheless addressed the appellant’s challenge of the protective order.  In
      this portion of the reasons I understand the motion judge to be saying
      that in the event he was wrong and that intervenor status ought to be granted
      to the appellant, this is how he would have ruled on the merits of the
      challenge to the protective order.</span></p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;

      respect to the motion judge’s analysis of the appropriateness of continuing
      the protective order, I agree with Juriansz J.A.’s observation at para.
      41 that the motion judge’s perception that the appellant lacked sufficient
      connection to challenge the protective order would have undermined the
      appellant’s position.  The procedure that the motion judge adopted and
      the conclusions he reached might have been different had he appreciated
      that the effect such orders have on the rights of the media warranted granting
      intervenor status to the appellant.  It may also explain why he considered
      it unnecessary to review the sealed materials and why he refused to grant
      the appellant conditional access to these materials for the purpose of
      making submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    dealing with the protective order issue, the motion judge correctly identified
    the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck </i>test as being applicable to all discretionary
    orders limiting freedom of the press and recognized that Mr. Black’s fair
    trial interest may be imperilled.  Indeed, the appellant has acknowledged
    as much.  The balancing pursuant to the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck </i>test requires,
    however, that a high threshold be met before a protective order will be granted.  The
    court is required to balance the constitutionally entrenched freedom of expression
    against the right to privacy and the right to a fair trial. The reason for
    this approach was addressed in <i>Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Ontario, </i>[2005]
    2 S.C.R. 188<i> </i>at para. 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>It is well established that court proceedings are presumptively “open” in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Public access will be barred only when the appropriate court, in the exercise
    of its discretion, concludes that disclosure would subvert the ends of justice
    or unduly impair its proper administration.</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    protective order places the court file out of reach of the public and the
    media.  Because the motion judge refused to give the appellant, a media enterprise,
    intervenor status for the limited purpose of challenging the protective order,
    it is apparent to me that his analysis as well as his exercise of discretion
    respecting the maintenance of the protective order were affected.  Without
    the press interest being factored into the balancing, the balancing was inevitably
    tainted. </p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the particular circumstances of this case, I view the portion of the motion
      judge’s decision to maintain the protective order to be in the nature of <i>obiter</i> <i>dicta</i> and
      for the reasons described above, strongly linked to the decision on intervenor
      status.  Having determined that the motion judge erred and that he ought
      to have given the appellant the standing of intervenor to challenge the
      protective order, it follows that the decision in its entirety must be
      set aside.  There is, therefore, no need to decide whether the portion
      of the decision relating to the protective order, were it to stand alone,
      is final or interlocutory for the purpose of determining the appeal route.</span></p>

      turn now to the issue of remedy.  On this issue I would reach a different
      result from Juriansz J.A.  Because the sealed materials have not been filed
      in this court, we are unable to examine them to assess any potential prejudice.  In
      the circumstances of this case, the balancing required to meet the high
      threshold set by the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test requires an examination
      of the documents themselves and an assessment of the potential effect on
      Mr. Black’s trial fairness.  Without having reviewed the materials, I cannot
      say, with certainty, that if the balancing of interests was done with the
      benefit of such a review it would invariably result in all of the materials
      being made public.</span></p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant’s submission that the determination of whether the
    fairness of Mr. Black’s trial was in fact at risk is best made on the basis
    of informed submissions.  Once the appellant is given intervenor status and
    reviews the materials, the Superior Court may hear submissions on any potential
    prejudice to Mr. Black’s trial and other possible prejudices that support
    maintaining the protective order.  These submissions would be made with reference
    to specific passages in the documents so that the court would be in a position
    to assess the significance of any such prejudice together with other relevant
    factors such as the public policy interest in encouraging settlement.  Against
    these would be weighed the public interest in “open courts”, as well as <i>Charter </i>considerations,
    such as the core values of expression included in s. 2(b).</p>
  <p class=NumberedParagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      I reach a different result, I agree with Juriansz J.A.’s analysis of the
      burden of proof and agree that the motion judge’s concerns regarding self-incrimination
      were misplaced given that the settlement reached had obviated the need
      for Mr. Black to file any materials in response to Hollinger’s motion.  Further,
      I agree that, absent reference to specific information in the documents,
      the concern over Mr. Black’s fair trial rights was no more than unfounded
      speculation.  Because of the approach he adopted, the motion judge did
      not undertake a review of the sealed materials to assess the strength of
      Mr. Black’s allegations in this regard.  Finally, I agree that the motion
      judge erred by failing to consider whether there was a portion of the sealed
      material that could be released.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the result, I would set the order aside, grant the appellant intervenor
      status for the limited purpose of challenging the protective order and
      remit the balance of the appellant’s motion to the Superior Court for a
      new hearing.  It may well be, however, that a new hearing is unnecessary
      given the present reality.  Mr. Black’s trial and sentencing have already
      occurred and, as acknowledged by Mr. Black’s counsel, once those are concluded,
      Mr. Black would not likely have any legitimate basis for perpetuating the
      protective order.  If however, the new hearing does proceed, the appellant
      is to be given the opportunity to review the materials for the purpose
      of making submissions subject to filing an appropriate confidentiality
      undertaking.  The Superior Court will then evaluate whether there is potential
      prejudice to Mr. Black’s interests which would preclude some or all of
      the material being made public.  </span></p>
