    to commit fraud, fraud, and laundering the proceeds of crime, and an application

    United States on charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, health care fraud, witness
    tampering, conspiracy to launder money, and engaging in monetary transactions
    with criminally derived property.  Both the appeal and the application for
    judicial review turn on the sufficiency of the evidence and of the reasons

    of Justice when making the surrender order.  For convenience, I will refer

    drafted by an inspector with the United States Postal Inspection Service.  The

    and several others in relation to allegations of an elaborate health insurance
    fraud. </p>

    appellant and his wife, Sonia LaFontaine, controlled and operated a company
    called LaFontaine Rish Medical Associates (LRMA).  LRMA provided cosmetic
    medical procedures not normally considered medically necessary and therefore
    not usually covered by health insurance plans.  It is alleged that LRMA submitted
    numerous claims to health insurance companies for payment of cosmetic procedures
    by having doctors in its employ falsely certify that such procedures were
    medically necessary, or by falsely describing them as medically necessary
    procedures.  It is also alleged that LRMA submitted claims that included
    certifications that certain procedures had been performed by physicians,
    when the procedures were either not actually performed, or performed by non-physician
    LRMA employees, such as the appellant’s wife. </p>

    were under investigation for fraud and were served with a grand jury subpoena,
    they shredded patient files, claim forms, and other documents, and created
    documents to alter the description of procedures or the identities of patients.  The
    investigator’s review of LRMA bank records indicated that at about the same
    time, large sums of money were transferred from LRMA’s
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    set out the content of the guilty plea
    “allocution” of facts admitted by Dr. Benito Rish, who was involved with
    the appellant in operating LRMA.  American prosecutors attempted to introduce
    this plea allocution as evidence in the trial of the appellant’s wife—who
    was convicted—but the United States Supreme Court ultimately ruled it inadmissible.
    In an accompanying letter, the
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    prosecutor explained that he anticipated he would call Dr. Rish as a witness

    applies to submit proof of his death as fresh evidence.</p>

    appellant’s U.S. counsel stating that she has received an affirmation from
    Dr. Zizza—a physician employed by LRMA and a significant witness mentioned
    in the RoC—as well as a letter from Dr. Zizza’s former attorney, which indicate

    on a tourist visa in February 1998 and was arrested pursuant to the <i>Immigration
    Act </i>in April 1998.  Immigration proceedings concluded in October 2001
    with the finding that the appellant was inadmissible on the grounds that
    he was suspected of committing a serious criminal offence outside of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The Minister of Justice issued an Authority to Proceed under the <i>Extradition
    Act,</i> S.C. 1999, c. 19, in July 2001 for the offences corresponding to:
    conspiracy to commit fraud (ss. 380(1) and 465(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>);
    fraud (s. 380(1); conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime (s. 462.31
    and 465(1)(c); and laundering the proceeds of crime (s. 461.31).  The appellant
    was arrested for extradition in September 2001.  The extradition proceedings
    were, however, held in abeyance pending the appellant’s unsuccessful attempt
    to quash the Authority to Proceed in the Federal Court, which was not finally
    concluded until the Supreme Court of Canada denied leave to appeal in April
    2006. </p>

    extradition hearing commenced before Gans J. in April 2006.  At that time,
    the Attorney General indicated that he was not seeking committal for conspiracy
    to launder the proceeds of crime, presumably because the only other suspected
    party to the conspiracy was the appellant’s wife.  Justice Gans made several
    rulings and decisions that the parties acknowledged to be binding, and the
    hearing itself proceeded before Beaulieu&nbsp;J. (“the extradition judge”)
    in October 2006. </p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    extradition judge found that the RoC contained evidence of a scheme to defraud
    insurance companies, which involved the appellant, his wife, and other employees,
    doctors, and patients at LRMA.  He found that there was evidence that the
    appellant, as one of the directing minds of LRMA, was a personally involved
    principal behind this fraud who signed forms and engaged in conversations
    with patients and witnesses concerning fraudulent insurance claims.  There
    was evidence from patients and employees, corroborated by billing records,
    patient files, and other documents obtained from LRMA and insurance companies,
    that false insurance claim forms were routinely submitted to insurers.  The
    extradition judge observed that the RoC’s evidence includes insurance forms
    and other documents obtained from health insurance companies that indicate
    payments on fraudulent claims, as well as bank records that reveal deposits
    from cheques of such insurance companies into bank accounts belonging to
    the appellant and his wife.  The RoC states that bank records also document
    various wire transfers of funds from New York bank accounts to Toronto bank
    accounts controlled by the appellant and his wife, which took place after
    deposits of more than $10,000 in payments on claims believed to be fraudulent.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    extradition judge dismissed the appellant’s application to stay the proceedings
    as an abuse of process, and made an order committing the appellant for extradition
    on the offences corresponding to the following Canadian <i>Criminal Code</i> offences:
    conspiracy to commit fraud (ss. 380(1) and 465(1)(c)); fraud (s. 380(1));
    and laundering the proceeds of crime (s. 462.31).</p>

    the order of committal, the appellant made no submissions to the Minister
    of Justice. Because the appellant had submitted a refugee claim, the Minister
    consulted with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and provided
    the results of the consultation to the appellant’s counsel in February 2007.  The
    Minister ordered the appellant’s surrender in March 2007 on the following
    offences under Title 18 of the United States Code: one count of conspiracy
    to violate the laws of the United States (s.&nbsp;317); nine counts of mail
    fraud (ss. 1341–42); one count of health care fraud (s. 1347); one count
    of witness tampering (ss. 1512(b)(2) &amp; (3)); one count of conspiracy
    to commit money laundering (s. 1956(h)); and four counts of engaging in monetary
    transactions with criminally derived property (s. 1957).</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant did not request reasons, he filed an application for judicial
    review in April 2007, based in part on the Minister’s failure to provide
    such reasons.  The Minister then sent the appellant’s counsel a letter in
    July 2007 explaining his reasons for ordering surrender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister explained that he ordinarily did not provide reasons in the absence
    of submissions, but that he had decided to provide reasons in response to
    the appellant’s application for judicial review on the basis that no reasons
    were provided.  The Minister stated that he had concluded after careful review
    that surrender would not be inconsistent with the <i>Extradition Act</i>,
    the U.S.-Canada extradition treaty, or the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister noted that in determining which offences to surrender on, he must
    be satisfied that the conduct underpinning the U.S. offences for which surrender
    is being ordered would be criminal under Canadian law, but it is unnecessary
    that the Canadian offences have the same name or legal elements as the offences
    charged in the U.S.  The Minister stated that he was aware that the Attorney
    General did not seek committal on the offence of conspiracy to launder the
    proceeds of crime, but the Minister took the position that the conduct underlying
    the U.S. charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering was the same conduct
    that the extradition judge relied upon to order committal for laundering
    the proceeds of crime.  The Minister concluded that the fact that there was
    no committal on conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime, which would
    be an exact match to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    offence of conspiracy to commit money laundering, was no impediment to the
    Minister’s decision to surrender on this offence.</p>

    appellant has raised a long list of issues in relation to the committal order.  In
    my view, those issues are without merit and accordingly, my reasons for disposing
    of those issues will be brief.  However, as I will explain, I agree with
    the appellant that there was no authority for the Minister to make a surrender
    order in relation to conspiracy to launder money and witness tampering and
    that the appellant is entitled to judicial review quashing that aspect of
    the surrender order.</p>

    the extreme legislative end of the continuum of administrative decision-making.”  A
    ministerial decision of this nature is plainly distinguishable from a decision
    provided at the conclusion of a contested administrative hearing or trial
    where evidence has been led, submissions have been made, and issues have
    been identified for resolution.  Here, the appellant failed to raise any

      must still ensure that the surrender should not be refused under the Act.
      For example, if the file satisfies the Minister that extradition would
      be unjust or oppressive (s. 44(1)(<span class=italic1><span style='color:black;font-style:

      under the law of the extradition partner (s. 46(1)(<span class=italic1><span style='color:black;font-style:normal;

      other hand, without the insight provided by submissions from the person

      mean that the Minister is always obliged to provide reasons for his or
      her decision when the person sought has made no submissions. In any case,
      the failure to give reasons does not mean that the Minster has not studied

    the extradition treaty nor the principle of double criminality require that
    the offences in the committal order and the foreign offences named in the
    surrender order possess precisely the same name or elements, so long as the
    conduct captured by the corresponding Canadian offences includes the conduct
    that constitutes the foreign offences for which the surrender order is made.  The
    respondent argues that the extradition judge ordered committal for laundering
    the proceeds of crime, and the conduct supporting committal on this offence
    also entails the conduct required for the offence of conspiracy to commit
    money laundering. </p>

    accept the submission that the test for surrender is conduct-based, but I
    fail to see how that supports surrender on the charges of conspiracy to launder
    money and witness tampering.  In <i>United States of America v. Gorcyca</i> (2007),
    216 C.C.C. (3d) 403 at para. 64, this court held that a surrender order is
    presumptively unreasonable “where there is an absence of evidence on what
    would appear to be an essential element of the foreign charge in the surrender
    order”.  An essential element of the conduct required for conspiracy is <i>an
    agreement</i> to commit a substantive offence.  After abandoning his request
    to commit the appellant for conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime,
    the Attorney General made no effort at the committal hearing to lead evidence
    of an agreement to engage in money laundering.  Consequently, the extradition
    judge did not make a finding that there was sufficient evidence of such an
    agreement.  An essential element of conduct required to support conspiracy—namely,
    an agreement to commit an unlawful act—cannot be found in or derived from
    evidence that establishes only that the accused engaged in the unlawful act.</p>

    the Attorney General did not seek committal for the Canadian offence corresponding

    is part and parcel of the conduct captured by the fraud committal as the
    RoC alleges in relation to one of the fraud allegations that the appellant
    told a patient to mislead investigators.  I disagree.  Witness tampering—or,
    in Canadian terms, obstruction of justice—involves conduct that is quite
    different and distinct from fraud.  In my opinion, the committal for fraud

    fact mentally incapable of testifying) to support the committal.</p>

    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from the committal order, but allow
    the application for judicial review to the following extent only: insofar
    as the surrender order purports to surrender the appellant on charges of
    conspiracy to commit money laundering or witness tampering, those parts of
    the order should be set aside.  Otherwise, I would dismiss the application
    for judicial review and uphold the surrender order.</p>
