    his trial by McIsaac J. without a jury, the appellant was convicted of the
    following four counts in an indictment:</p>
  <p>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal
    negligence causing the death of Dr. Barry Ehrlich;</p>

  <p>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Impaired
    driving causing bodily harm to Tamar Ehrlich.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the appellant’s sentence hearing, the trial judge stayed the impaired driving
    convictions. On the charge of criminal negligence causing death, he sentenced
    the appellant to imprisonment for three years, after crediting him on a one-for-one
    basis for time spent (slightly over one year) in pre-trial custody. On the
    charge of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the appellant received
    a sentence of two years’ imprisonment consecutive. Hence, in total, the appellant
    was sentenced to imprisonment for five years. In addition, he was prohibited
    from driving for fifteen years and was required to provide a DNA sample.</p>

      APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his appeal from conviction, the appellant has raised numerous
    grounds of appeal, most of which relate to the trial judge’s fact-finding
    process. Although the various grounds are framed as legal issues, by and
    large, the appellant is attempting to have this court re-try the case. That,
    of course, is not our function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    the grounds that actually do raise legal issues, only one has merit. It relates
    to the trial judge’s misuse of certain after-the-fact evidence to infer guilt.
    Overall, however, I am satisfied that the error was harmless and the verdicts
    would necessarily have been the same had it not been made. Hence, on that
    ground, the curative proviso can safely be applied to sustain the convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also alleges that his trial counsel was incompetent and that he
    failed to provide the appellant with effective representation. The appellant
    maintains that with proper representation, it is reasonably likely that the
    verdicts would have been different; alternatively, he submits that he was
    deprived of a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Much
    as I am concerned about the quality of representation the appellant received
    at trial, I am not persuaded that the alleged ineffective representation
    undermined the reliability of the verdicts; nor did it deprive the appellant
    of his right to a fair trial. Hence, I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Fact-Driven
      Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the verdicts against him are unreasonable because
    in reaching them, the trial judge misapprehended material evidence and failed
    to consider material evidence. Hence, he submits that the verdicts cannot
    stand and a new trial should be ordered. I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a complicated case. The appellant was driving westerly along Highway
    9 when his vehicle suddenly swerved into the eastbound lane and collided
    with Dr. Ehrlich’s vehicle. Dr. Ehrlich, the driver, was killed in the accident;
    his wife, who was a passenger, was badly maimed. Stripped to its essentials,
    the case turned on one issue—how did the appellant’s vehicle come to be in
    the wrong lane? The Crown put it down to reckless driving fuelled by alcohol
    impairment; the appellant claimed
    “inevitable” accident.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(i)        <i>The Crown’s Position</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown took the position that in the several minutes preceding the accident,
    the appellant was driving erratically, in treacherous driving conditions,
    in a Ford Mustang vehicle that he knew to be unstable under such conditions.
    Three motorists who came into proximity with the appellant shortly before
    the accident attested to his erratic driving, which they said consisted of
    changing lanes without signalling, driving with one hand on the steering
    wheel, passing on a hill, passing on the right in a dangerous snow-covered
    lane and, most significantly, exceeding the 80 km per hour speed limit by
    as much as 15 to 20 km per hour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the Crown, the appellant’s high rate of speed was particularly perilous
    under the prevailing weather and road conditions. High winds and gusting
    and blowing snow made for treacherous driving. Visibility was poor and the
    road surface was wet and slippery in places and snow-covered in others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blowing
    snow created a particular hazard that day, especially as it accumulated and
    developed into drifts along the travelled portion of the roadway. Indeed,
    according to a central Crown witness who was travelling immediately behind
    the appellant when the accident occurred, after the appellant’s vehicle passed
    his tractor trailer unit on its right at a speed of 95 to 100 km per hour,
    it accelerated, hit a patch of snow, and careened out of control. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the Crown, the appellant’s erratic driving was attributable, at least
    in part, to his impairment by alcohol. A blood sample taken from him at 4:00
    p.m., three hours after the accident, revealed a blood alcohol level of 80
    mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood. Extrapolating backwards, this meant that
    at the time of the accident, at around 1:00 p.m., the appellant’s blood alcohol
    content would have been at least 100 mg per 100 mL of blood. Expert testimony
    confirmed that at that level, the appellant’s ability to drive would have
    been impaired. The appellant himself admitted to consuming at least 32 oz
    and quite possibly 40 oz of beer over a quick lunch. He stopped drinking
    some 25 minutes before the accident occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the Crown attributed the accident to the appellant’s erratic driving
    at high rates of speed, in treacherous weather conditions, in a car known
    by him to be unstable in such conditions, while his ability to drive was
    impaired by alcohol. In combination, those features supported the charges
    of criminal negligence and driving while impaired. </p>

lang=EN-US>The Appellant’s Position</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant attributed the accident to a powerful gust of wind that pushed
    his car from the westbound lane to the eastbound lane into the path of Dr.
    Ehrlich’s vehicle. He denied that he was driving erratically before the accident.
    He maintained that his speed was not excessive in the circumstances and,
    in any event, was in line with that of the other vehicles that he encountered.
    He denied passing the tractor-trailer on the right and claimed that he was
    not impaired as a result of the beer he consumed at lunch. Overall, from
    his perspective, the accident was a tragic mishap occasioned by forces of
    nature beyond his control.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)     <i>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in his reasons for judgment reviewed the pertinent evidence and,
    in the end, he rejected the appellant’s version of the events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge explained in some detail why he found the appellant
    to be an incredible witness. In particular, he rejected the appellant’s evidence
    as to the amount of alcohol he consumed at lunch, first, because it did not
    comport with the toxicological evidence, and second, because the appellant,
    in an effort to mislead, falsely told the investigating officer and a paramedic
    at the scene of the accident that he had not consumed any alcohol that day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge further found that the appellant’s departure abroad shortly after
    the accident was evidence from which he could infer guilt. More will be said
    about that finding in due course.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that his car was blown from
    the westbound lane into the eastbound lane by a violent gust of wind. While
    other motorists attested to strong winds, none described them as reaching “the
    extraordinary level described by [the appellant].”
    Moreover, when the appellant’s vehicle went out of control, it rotated in
    a counter-clockwise fashion, as portrayed in the accident reconstruction
    sketch, with its “rear end rotating into the wind as opposed to with the
    wind.”
    Although the trial judge did not say so explicitly, that rotation, in his
    view, did not accord with what he would have expected had the wind caught
    hold of the rear end (the light end) of the appellant’s vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered the evidence of the three motorists, called by
    the Crown, who described the appellant’s erratic driving. He explained, in
    straightforward terms, why he accepted their evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>I accept the evidence of the witnesses James Youldon, Robert Tadier and
    David Fox when they describe erratic driving on the part of the defendant
    even though their descriptions are of different aspects of that driving.
    They describe actions and conduct which are predicted from Dr. Mayer’s expectations
    of a driver who has had too much to drink. They include improvident passing
    of other vehicles, failure to modify driving to accommodate weather conditions
    and failure to respond to emergent circumstances such as snow drifts across
    the roadway. I accept all of this evidence from these independent witnesses
    who have absolutely no reason to falsely accuse the defendant. Accordingly,
    I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, at the time in question, the
    ability of the defendant to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol
    and that such condition was not only a real factor in the cause of the collision,
    it was the major cause of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge turned his attention to whether the appellant’s conduct amounted
    to criminal negligence. In concluding that it did, the trial judge noted
    that when the appellant entered his vehicle after lunch, he was impaired
    by alcohol “to the extent that he should not [have been] operating a motor
    vehicle.” Nonetheless, the appellant did so and in the process, “he chose
    to blind himself to the inevitable consequences of that conduct despite his
    condition when coupled with the treacherous conditions of the roadway.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant had attained “that degree of greater moral fault which
    elevates dangerous driving to the level of criminal negligence based on the
    factor of impairment by alcohol”. Accordingly, he found the appellant guilty
    on all counts.</p>

    appellant left
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    several weeks after the accident. Before leaving, he spoke to the investigating
    officer, who informed him that charges were pending but that the investigation
    was continuing. After the appellant was abroad, he again contacted the investigating
    officer and was given the same information as before. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the appellant was arrested in April 2003 in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gibraltar. According to the appellant, it was then, for the first time, that

    April 2001, approximately one and a half months after the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    being arrested, the appellant was returned to

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in July 2003. He did not contest extradition. According to the investigating
    officer, the appellant kept her abreast of his whereabouts after going abroad.
    She also testified that he had been completely cooperative in the investigation
    from the time of the accident to the time of his return to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

    testified that he went abroad not to flee the Canadian authorities but to
    get some relief from the emotional stress he was experiencing after the accident.
    He testified that while abroad, he travelled across
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Portugal</st1:country-region>
    , and
    <st1:place

    Gibraltar using his own passport and he registered at the tax offices in
    those countries using his own name. The Crown led no evidence to the contrary.
    The appellant further testified that his girlfriend joined him abroad and
    that his pets were flown to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      Portugal</st1:country-region>
    as soon as they were released from quarantine. In short, the appellant vehemently
    denied that he went abroad to avoid potential criminal liability in

    that evidentiary backdrop, the trial judge found that the appellant departed
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    “to flee the reach of the Canadian authorities” and that “he remained a fugitive
    until he was arrested in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gibraltar in April 2003.” In so concluding, the trial judge counted the appellant’s
    dated criminal record as a further incentive to flee. The appellant’s record
    consisted of two prior driving offences—one for driving with a blood alcohol
    level over 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood in 1988 and the other for
    criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle in 1985.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    respect, I am of the view that the trial judge erred in treating the appellant’s
    departure from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    as post-offence conduct from which guilt could be inferred. In drawing that
    conclusion, the trial judge made no mention whatsoever of the evidence, including
    that of the investigating officer, that lent credence to the appellant’s
    account of his activities and his explanation for leaving. In the face of
    the appellant’s communication with the investigating officer and his continuous
    cooperation, the inference drawn by the trial judge was at best tenuous and,
    in my view, unwarranted. In short, the departure evidence should not have
    been used as a basis for inferring the appellant’s guilt; nor should it have
    been used to discredit him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the misuse of the departure evidence was not fatal. It was one of many
    factors that the trial judge took into account in rejecting the appellant’s
    evidence and in finding that his guilt had been proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the verdicts would necessarily
    have been the same had the trial judge not misused the departure evidence.</p>

    this regard, I note that the trial judge’s critical findings as to the appellant’s
    manner of driving are anchored in the evidence of three independent witnesses
    who had “absolutely no reason to falsely accuse the defendant”. His finding
    of impairment is anchored in the unassailable toxicological evidence, about
    which more will be said, which showed that the appellant had a blood alcohol
    level of at least 100 mg per 100 mL of blood at the time of the accident.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    picture that emerges from those findings is clear. The appellant was driving
    with reckless abandon for a considerable distance in treacherous driving
    conditions, in a car known by him to be unsuited to such conditions, while
    his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. In those circumstances, it
    seems to me that little turns on whether the appellant lost control of his
    vehicle by reason of a strong gust of wind (a known and obvious hazard) or
    by coming into contact with a mound of drifting snow (another known and obvious
    hazard) or both.</p>

    short, I am satisfied that the evidence of the appellant’s guilt on the charge
    of criminal negligence was overwhelming and that a new trial would merely
    postpone the inevitable. Accordingly, this is a case in which the curative
    proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> can safely be applied

    considering whether Mr. Scully’s conduct amounted to incompetence, our initial
    task is to consider the record, as augmented by the fresh evidence, to determine
    whether the appellant was prejudiced by reason of his counsel’s alleged incompetence.
    To succeed in that regard, the appellant must establish either that there
    is a reasonable probability that the verdicts would have been different had
    he received effective legal representation, or that his counsel’s conduct
    deprived him of a fair trial: see <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520.
    In the end, although I have concerns about this ground of appeal, I have
    not been persuaded that trial counsel’s alleged incompetence undermined the
    integrity or reliability of the verdicts, or that it rendered the trial unfair.
    In other words, the appellant has failed to establish prejudice.</p>

    order to determine whether trial counsel’s conduct undermined the reliability
    of the verdict, it is important to understand the strong evidentiary basis
    upon which the appellant was convicted. The Crown presented a formidable
    case against the appellant, consisting of the following four components:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    those four components, the second (treacherous driving conditions) and the
    third (unstable vehicle) were all but acknowledged by the appellant and they
    play no part in the determination of this appeal. Neither of these components
    would have been affected had the appellant’s trial counsel performed differently. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the first component (erratic driving at a high rate of speed), three
    civilian witnesses registered serious complaints about the appellant’s manner
    of driving. Despite the appellant’s efforts to downplay their concerns, their
    evidence was striking when viewed cumulatively, and they presented the appellant
    with a very difficult hurdle to overcome. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that Mr. Scully could have made inroads into the testimony
    of these witnesses had he prepared better. The appellant points to several
    instances where one or another of the witnesses gave evidence at trial that
    differed from a prior statement the witness had provided to the police or
    at the preliminary hearing. The appellant also points to a statement from
    one of the witnesses, Mr. Tadier, which reported that Mr. Fox, the tractor-trailer
    driver who testified at trial, showed anger towards the appellant for having “caused
    the accident” and he refused to let the appellant use his cell phone at the
    accident scene (something which Mr. Tadier and his wife “felt was kind of
    appropriate in a way”). The appellant submits that his counsel should have
    elicited that evidence, as it demonstrated animus and could have been used
    to impugn the testimony of Mr. Fox and Mr. Tadier. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see little substance in the appellant’s submission. The alleged inconsistencies
    to which he refers are minor and inconsequential and they would not, in my
    view, have impacted on the verdicts had they been elicited. In particular,
    although the appellant makes much of the fact that Mr. Fox supposedly changed
    the evidence he gave at the preliminary hearing—by testifying at trial that
    the appellant accelerated after passing his tractor trailer on the right—a
    close reading of Mr. Fox’s testimony at the preliminary hearing fails to
    support this contention. At best, Mr. Fox’s preliminary hearing evidence
    is ambiguous; in the end, he testified that after the Mustang passed him
    on the right, it was “pulling away” from him when it hit a patch of snow
    and went out of control. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the evidence of Mr. Fox’s animus towards the appellant at the scene,
    it is not at all obvious how the appellant was prejudiced by counsel’s failure
    to raise this animus. Indeed, had Mr. Scully done so, he might have reinforced
    the Crown’s case by showing the intensity of Mr. Fox’s reaction to the appellant’s
    bad driving. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, even if counsel had cross-examined the civilian witnesses as the appellant
    contends he should have, I am not persuaded that it would have made any difference
    to the trial judge’s assessment of their evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    leaves the fourth component of the Crown’s case—namely, whether the appellant
    was impaired by alcohol at the time of the collision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is on this issue, perhaps more than any other, that the appellant submits
    that his trial counsel fell down on the job and failed to provide him with
    effective assistance. In particular, he faults counsel for calling Dr. Kader,
    a defence toxicologist who ended up doing more harm than good. Far from establishing
    that the appellant was not impaired (the reason for his retention), Dr. Kader
    did just the opposite. In the end, the appellant maintains that he would
    have been better off without a defence expert and that his counsel would
    have realized this had he thought about the case and been properly prepared. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I would not give effect to this argument. This conclusion
    is not intended as an endorsement of defence counsel’s decision to call the
    defence expert that he used in this case, nor of his strategy at large in
    addressing the issue of the appellant’s impairment. Indeed, I have reason
    to believe that the strategy he adopted was ill-conceived, either due to
    a lack of preparation or a failure on his part to think the case through. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be
    that as it may, the appellant’s overriding problem stems not from his counsel’s
    strategy, good or bad, but from a particularly damaging piece of evidence
    that went unchallenged at trial and remains unchallenged on appeal—the test
    results from the blood sample taken from the appellant at the hospital at
    4:00 p.m., some three hours after the accident, which revealed a blood alcohol
    level of 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood. Absent a finding that this
    evidence should not have been admitted—or, if admitted, that it was unreliable—it
    virtually sealed the appellant’s fate when considered with the toxicological
    evidence concerning the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the human
    body.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    toxicologists, Dr. Mayers for the Crown and Dr. Kader for the defence, agreed
    that the human body eliminates alcohol at a rate of 10 to 20 mg per 100 mL
    of blood every hour. That evidence was unchallenged at trial and remains
    unchallenged on appeal. Applying the lowest of those figures (10 mg) to this
    case, that would mean that when the accident occurred at around 1:00 p.m.,
    the appellant would have had a blood alcohol level of 110 mg per 100 mL of
    blood; using the highest of those figures (20 milligrams), his blood alcohol
    level could have been as high as 140 mg per 100 mL of blood.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    no circumstances could the appellant have reached those levels had he only
    consumed the proverbial two beers over lunch. Based on the toxicological
    evidence adduced at trial, it is theoretically possible that he could have
    reached the lower end of those levels if he had consumed two 20-oz glasses
    of beer over lunch, something that the appellant agreed was possible during
    his own testimony. If, however, he only consumed two 16-oz glasses of beer
    over lunch, he could not possibly have reached a level of 100 mg or more
    of alcohol per 100 mL of blood at 1:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless
    of how he reached a level of more than 100 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood
    at around 1:00&nbsp;p.m., it was Dr. Mayers’
    uncontradicted opinion that “all individuals would have their ability to
    operate a motor vehicle impaired by alcohol” at that level. Dr. Mayers elaborated
    that at levels exceeding 100 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood, a person’s
    ability to judge distances and the speed of vehicles would be affected, reaction
    times would be compromised, and visual cues and peripheral information would
    be missed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, this body of evidence, when viewed as a whole, was highly damaging
    to the appellant. In the face of it, if the appellant hoped to cast doubt
    on the issue of his impairment at the time of the accident, he had to keep
    the 4:00 p.m. hospital test result of 80 mg of alcohol per 100mL of blood
    out of evidence, or at the very least, discredit it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
    counsel at trial did neither. Indeed, although the record is not entirely
    clear, Mr. Scully may have actually conceded the reliability of the 80 mg
    of alcohol per 100 mL of blood reading. Regardless, absent a reasonable explanation
    from trial counsel as to why he did not attempt to exclude the blood sample
    or to at least discredit it—something we do not have—his competence is presumptively
    called into question. </p>

    this does not get the appellant home. As indicated, to succeed on his incompetence
    of counsel claim, the appellant must show that he was prejudiced, and in
    my view, he has not done so. Specifically, he has failed to tender any evidence
    on appeal (and none exists in the trial record) from which we could infer,
    let alone find, that the 4:00&nbsp;p.m. blood alcohol test at the hospital
    should have been excluded from evidence or if not excluded, that it was otherwise
    unreliable: see <i>R. v. Persad</i> (2001), 82 C.R.R. (2d) 373 at paras.

    differently, absent an evidentiary foundation, it is not enough for the appellant
    to claim that the blood sample evidence might theoretically have been excluded
    on the basis of some unidentified <i>Charter</i> breach; nor is it enough
    to speculate that the hospital staff may have taken the sample improperly
    or that it somehow became contaminated thereafter and that these hypothetical
    breaches would have been uncovered by more diligent counsel. </p>

    follows that even if the defence put forward by the appellant on the issue
    of impairment—that he only had two pints of beer and that he was not above
    the legal limit or impaired at the time of the accident—was ill-conceived
    or poorly presented, there is nothing before us to indicate a reasonable
    likelihood that the verdicts would have been different had the appellant
    been more effectively represented.</p>

    that trial counsel’s performance resulted in an unfair trial. In rejecting
    this ground of appeal, I have not ignored the many complaints raised by the
    appellant about Mr. Scully’s “less than adequate”
    performance at trial, his inadequate preparation in general, and his failure
    to prepare the appellant to give evidence and to be cross-examined—complaints
    that have gone unanswered by counsel. In the end, while those allegations
    are troubling, they fall short of satisfying me that the appellant received
    an unfair trial. Poor though his counsel’s performance may have been, it
    did not approximate the level of “non-performance” required to establish

'>[1]</span></span></span></a></span> In particular, based on the record, I am
    satisfied that counsel knew the appellant’s version of what happened (see <i>R.
    v. B. (L.C.)</i> (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 686 at 704 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ))<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and that the appellant (as he affirmed in his
    affidavit) “gave an accurate description of what happened that day.” Furthermore,
    I am satisfied that the appellant handled himself adequately in cross-examination
    and in any event, he has not explained how he could have been better prepared
    or have made greater headway in the face of the strong Crown case against
    him. </p>

    same can be said of counsel’s cross-examination, his closing submissions,
    and his submissions on sentence. Again, counsel’s performance exceeded the “non-performance” standard
    needed to establish a miscarriage of justice as a result of an unfair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I am not persuaded that trial counsel’s performance occasioned
    a miscarriage of justice, either by undermining the reliability of the verdict
    or by rendering the trial unfair. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal
    from conviction.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        SENTENCE

line-height:normal;'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, the appellant received a total sentence of five years’ imprisonment.
    This consisted of four years for the offence of criminal negligence causing
    death, less one year, on a one-for-one basis, for time spent in pre-trial
    custody, and two years consecutive for the offence of criminal negligence
    causing bodily harm. In other words, absent time spent in pre-trial custody,
    the trial judge considered that a global sentence of six years imprisonment
    was fit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the six-year total sentence was fit and well within the range of
    sentences imposed for crimes of this nature. The appellant was driving with
    reckless abandon in driving conditions that were treacherous. He and others
    like him must be deterred. They are a menace on the highways and they cause
    terrible carnage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s moral culpability was high and was significantly enhanced by
    his impairment by alcohol. In short, on the afternoon in question, he showed
    callous disregard for the lives and safety of others and his criminal conduct
    resulted in horrific consequences. He killed Dr. Ehrlich and maimed Mrs.
    Ehrlich for life. The Ehrlich family has suffered greatly and their lives
    will never again be the same. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    one difficulty that I have with the sentence imposed by the trial judge relates
    to his treatment of the time spent by the appellant in pre-trial custody
    (approximately one year). In refusing to credit the appellant on a two-for-one
    basis, the trial judge stated that he was not prepared to do so “due to the
    aggravating factor of the offender’s flight from justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed earlier, the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s departure
    from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    was wrong and he erred in treating it as post-offence conduct capable of
    supporting the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    his usual candour, Mr. Pearson for the Crown acknowledged that if the trial
    judge erred in his assessment of the appellant’s departure from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , then he erred as well in failing to credit the appellant on a two-for-one
    basis for the time spent in pre-trial custody. Given my conclusion on this
    issue, and Mr. Pearson’s concession, I am of the view that the global sentence
    must be reduced by one year. I would give effect to this by reducing the
    sentence on the charge of criminal negligence causing death from three years
    to two years. In all other respects, I would not interfere with the sentence
    imposed at trial. In particular, I see no error in the 15-year driving prohibition
    imposed by the trial judge under s.&nbsp;259(2)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    especially in view of the appellant’s prior driving convictions.</p>

    the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted and I would vary the sentence

    finding of non-performance generally occurs in cases where counsel’s incompetence
    is pervasive.  See, for example, <i>R. v. Cook and Cain</i> (1980), 53 C.C.C.
    (2d) 217 at 224 (Ont. C.A.), in which counsel was impaired during a good
    part of the trial, including his closing address; see also <i>R. v. Widdifield </i>(1995),
    25 O.R. (3d) 161 at 171–78 (C.A.),<i> </i>in which this court held that an
    accused can sustain a claim of ineffective representation of counsel, without
    proving prejudice, where trial counsel has a conflict of interest that impairs
    his or her capacity to effectively represent the accused’s interests.</p>

      performance did not undermine confidence in the verdict, rather than on
      trial fairness grounds.</p>
