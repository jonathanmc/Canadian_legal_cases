    Molina, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Pejic were all acquitted at separate trials in
    the Ontario Court of Justice of driving while disqualified contrary to s.
    259(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Their appeals were heard together, both
    in
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court and in this Court, because they raise a common
    issue.  That issue is whether s.&nbsp;260(1)(c) of the <i>Code</i> had been
    complied with when the appellants signed their respective prohibition orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compliance
    with s. 260(1) of the <i>Code</i> – which requires the court to ensure that
    an offender who is disqualified from driving is informed of the provisions
    of s. 259(4) – is a pre-condition to a conviction for driving while disqualified
    under s.&nbsp;259(4).  The appellants were each provided with a prohibition
    order that was prepared using a standard, pre-printed form.  They each signed
    the form, acknowledging an understanding of its terms.  The courts below
    concluded that the forms were deficient, however, in that they did not specifically
    alert the offenders to the full penal provisions contained in s.&nbsp;259(4).
     They also held that the “presumption of regularity” did not operate to cure
    these deficiencies in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree, and would dismiss the Crown’s appeals essentially for the reasons
    given by Justice Glithero on the summary conviction appeal below.  I add
    the following brief comments.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>            Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant portions of ss. 259 and 260 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>259.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       Every one who operates a motor vehicle …
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    while disqualified from doing so</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (a)       is guilty of an indictable
    offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (b)       is guilty of an offence punishable
    on summary conviction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>260.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       If a court makes a prohibition order
    under section 259 in relation to an offender, it shall cause</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (a)       the order to be read by or
    to the offender;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (b)       a copy of the order to be
    given to the offender; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>            </i>(c)       <i>the offender to
      be informed of subsection 259(4).</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       After subsection (1) has been complied
    with in relation to an offender who is bound by an order referred to in that
    subsection, the offender shall endorse the order, acknowledging receipt of
    a copy thereof and that the order has been explained to him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       The failure of an offender to endorse
    an order pursuant to subsection (2) does not affect the validity of the order.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no issue at the appellants’ trials that each had been driving while subject
    to a prohibition order.  The only issue was whether the requirements of s.&nbsp;260(1)(c)
    had been complied with at the time the orders were made.  Were the appellants
    properly
    “informed of subsection 259(4)”? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    made subject to their respective prohibition orders, each of the appellants
    was provided with a prohibition order that was prepared using a standard,
    pre-printed form then in use in the South Central Region of the Ontario Court
    of Justice.  They each signed the order, acknowledging in the process that
    the order had been read by or to them, that they had received a copy of it,
    that the order had been explained to them, and that they “understood its
    terms and conditions”.  However, the forms did not include the following
    notification, which is included in the forms presently being used: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>AND TAKE NOTICE THAT</b> everyone who operates:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or
    other public place</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>while disqualified from so doing under the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, or in the case of motor vehicles, for such longer period provided
      for in the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> is, upon conviction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       is guilty of an indictable offence and
    is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       is guilty of an offence punishable on
    summary conviction  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>and</b>, in addition to the above in the case
    of motor vehicles, is subject to an additional twelve month driver’s licence
    suspension under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the prohibition order provided to, and signed by, Mr. Molina simply warned
    that everyone who operated a motor vehicle, etc. while disqualified is “upon
    conviction, guilty of an offence and is liable to a term of custody and supervision.”  Mr.
    Pejic’s prohibition order was drafted in the same language.  In the case
    of Mr. Bell, the comparable warning was that upon conviction for operating
    a vehicle while disqualified the offender “is liable to a term of imprisonment.”  None
    of these warnings brought home to the appellants the specifics of s. 259(4),
    namely that they could be found guilty of an indictable offence and imprisoned
    for up to five years or found guilty of an offence punishable on summary
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    Mr. Molina’s sentencing, the trial judge advised Mr. Molina that “you have
    to realize that every time you breach court orders, you are going to end
    up in jail.  It is as simple as that.”  On the record, that is the closest
    any of the trial judges came to conveying verbally the warning mandated by
    s. 260(1)(c).  There is no evidence of any comparable admonition by the trial
    judges in the cases of Mr. Bell or Mr. Pejic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Ontario Court of Justice, the trial judges all held that the foregoing
    circumstances were insufficient to ground a conviction for driving while
    disqualified; the Crown had failed to prove an essential element of the offence,
    namely, that the appellants had been “informed of subsection 259(4)”, as
    required by s. 260(1)(c).  The summary conviction appeal judge arrived at
    the same conclusion.  I agree.</p>

lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
        Presumption of Regularity</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues here – as it did below – that the
    “presumption of regularity” operates to cure any deficiencies in the s. 260(1)(c)
    notification procedure in the absence of evidence from the defence establishing
    that the provisions of the section were not complied with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presumption of regularity is a reflection of the Latin maxim: <i>omnia praesumuntur
    rite et solemniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium</i> (everything
    is presumed to be rightly and duly performed until the contrary is shown).  As
    Watt J. noted in <i>R. v. Kapoor</i> (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 41 at 68 (Ont.
    H.C.), it “has especial application in the case of persons who discharge
    a public or statutory duty.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Various
    authorities have drawn on the treatise of the great American authority on
    evidence, Professor John Henry Wigmore, in dealing with the underpinnings
    of the doctrine.  For example, Prowse J.A., speaking for the Alberta Court
    of Appeal in the context of a breach of probation case in <i>R. v. Scott</i> (1980),
    56 C.C.C. (2d) 111 at 113-114, said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This statement<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> constitutes an admission by the accused, and is
    therefore admissible as evidence of compliance with s. 663(4)(a) and (b).  The
    issue is whether, in the absence of positive evidence, the statement <i>supplies
    an element of probability justifying the presumption</i> that the explanation
    of ss. 664(4) and 666 was delivered by the sentencing Judge himself, as required.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In Wigmore A Treatise on the <i>Anglo-American
      System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law on Evidence</i>, 3rd ed. (1940),
      vol. IX, p. 488, that learned author proposes <i>several conditions for
      the application of the omnia praesumuntur rule</i>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>… first, that the matter is more or less in
    the past, and incapable of easily procured evidence; secondly, that it involves
    a mere formality, or detail of required procedure, in the routine of a litigation
    or of a public officer’s action; next, that it involves to some extent the
    security of apparently vested rights, so that the presumption will serve
    to prevent an unwholesome uncertainty; <i>and finally, that the circumstances
    of the particular case add some element of probability</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court approved that statement in <i>R. v. McNamara</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C.
    (2d) 24 at 28-29, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (1982) 66 C.C.C. (2d)
    24n.  It also approved the following additional admonition by Prowse J.A.
    in <i>Scott</i> at 114:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am in respectful agreement with the observation
    of Parker L.C.J. in <i>Scott v. Baker</i> (1968), 52 Cr. App. R. 566 at p.
    571, that <i>very great care must be taken in applying the presumption of
    regularity in criminal proceedings.  To purport to establish the guilt of
    an accused solely or largely by reliance on such a presumption would amount
    to a fundamental contradiction of the principles upon which our system of
    criminal law is based.</i>  That is not to say, however, that the presumption
    has no application.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally,
    the presumption of regularity has been resorted to in circumstances where
    there has been an irregularity in the creation of an official court document.  For
    example, it has been used where an information or summons is regular on its
    face but is attacked on the basis of some irregularity pertaining to the
    way in which it was signed or sworn: see<i> R. v. Burton</i>, [1970] 3 C.C.C.
    381 (Ont. H.C.); <i>R. v. Justice of the Peace, Ex parte Robertson</i> (1971),
    2 C.C.C. (2d) 416 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d)
    97 (Ont. H.C.).  The presumption has also been used to regularize an information
    by presuming that a justice of the peace – in the absence of evidence to
    the contrary – had held the necessary hearing prior to issuing process: <i>Re
    Morton and The Queen</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 244 (Ont. Gen. Div.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>McNamara, </i>this
    Court considered the application of the presumption of regularity in circumstances
    similar to these – in the context of a probation order.  That case would
    be analogous to this one if the content of the prohibition forms were also
    analogous.  However, they were not.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    background of <i>McNamara </i>is as follows.  As in the case of a driving
    prohibition, the <i>Criminal Code</i> mandates that a person placed on probation
    be informed of the consequences of failure to obey the probation order.  At
    the time the relevant provisions were found in ss. 663(4), 664(4), and 666
    of the <i>Code</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Subsection 663(4)(c) was the counterpart to the
    proviso in s. 260(1)(c) dealing with driving while disqualified; it required
    the court, when making a probation order, to “inform the accused of the provisions
    of subsection 664(4) and the provisions of section 666.”  Section 666 made
    it an offence to fail to comply with a probation order and s. 664(4) specified
    the penalties that could be imposed for doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    McNamara was on probation and was charged with failing to comply with his
    probation order.  The police gave evidence of the particulars of the breach
    and tendered the probation order as an exhibit.  The Crown proffered no evidence
    showing that the accused had been informed of the potential consequences
    of a breach of probation.  Mr. McNamara called no evidence.  The probation
    order was based on a standard form from the <i>Code</i> and had been used
    in three provinces, including
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The special terms of probation applicable to the offender were
    typed into blank spaces in the form and Mr. McNamara had signed the form
    acknowledging it had been read to him, that he understood its terms and conditions,
    that he had received a copy of the order, and that he had been informed of
    the provisions of ss. 666(4) and 666 of the <i>Code</i>.  Significantly,
    the provisions of subsection 664(4) and s. 666 were printed on the reverse
    side of the form in their entirety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court held that the decision of the judge below could have been upheld on
    the basis of the presumption of regularity (which presumed, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, that the judge below had complied with his statutory
    duty when he imposed the term of probation by informing the offender of the
    consequences of breaching the order).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    to the present appeals if the forms used in the appellants’ cases included
    the potential consequences of a breach, like the form used in <i>McNamara </i>and
    the forms presently in use.  But that is not the case.</p>

style='font-weight:normal'>The Presumption of Regularity Applied to This Case</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the <i>Wigmore </i>conditions have been satisfied and the presumption of
    regularity has been found to apply, it is open to the accused to rebut it
    by way of evidence.  The degree of proof required to displace the application
    of the presumption has been held to be proof on a balance of probabilities.  See <i>Kapoor </i>at
    70.  That evidence need not originate from the alleged offender or witnesses
    for the defence, however.  Here, the trial judges and the summary conviction
    appeal judge all concluded that there was evidence tendered by the Crown
    that rebutted the presumption, namely the prohibition order itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the result reached by the summary conviction appeal judge and
    with the reasons he articulates, namely (a) that the orders were defective
    or deficient in that they did not advise the appellants that they could be
    charged with an indictable offence and receive up to five years in jail if
    they drove while disqualified, and (b) that there is no reason to presume
    that the court clerk, in explaining the orders to the appellants, went beyond
    the terms prescribed in the orders in doing so.  As the summary conviction
    judge noted at para. 25 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Far from making it probable that the act [required
    by s. 260(1)(c)] had been done, <i>the evidence available to the trial court
    here made it unlikely that there was compliance</i> with Section 260(1) in
    that the only evidence on point, the signature and acknowledgment of the
    accused, relates to a deficient and inadequate level of warning.  There is
    no basis upon which to utilize the presumption of regularity to assume, as
    proof, that the officer who witnessed the signature of Mr. Molina went beyond
    the form of the order that the accused signed, and either read from a correct
    version of an order, or advised the accused orally out of his own knowledge.  There
    would be no point in having the accused sign and acknowledge a lesser and
    deficient form of warning if in fact the accused had been provided with a
    proper warning.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the fourth Wigmore requirement for the application of the presumption – “that
    the circumstances of the particular case add some element of probability” – did
    not exist in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor,
    for that matter, did the second Wigmore requirement – “that [the matter]
    involves a mere formality, or detail of required procedure, in the routine
    of a … public officer’s action” – apply on the facts here.  The requirement
    that an offender disqualified from driving be “informed of subsection 259(4)” means
    more than that the offender be simply advised of its existence; “informed”
    means that the details of the significant penal exposure triggered by the
    application of that section must be brought home to the offender.  Nothing
    less than that prerequisite is an element of the offence of driving while
    disqualified.  Informing an offender about the penal consequences of a breach
    is not simply a routine formality or procedural detail.</p>
