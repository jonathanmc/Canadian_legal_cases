  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 5, 1997 Harvinder Sandhu fell from a fifth floor apartment window at
    1901 Martin Grove Road in Toronto, landed on the cement pavement below that
    window and suffered catastrophic injuries as the result.  Harvinder was born
    April 26, 1995 and accordingly was just past his second birthday when he
    suffered the injuries which are the subject of this appeal.  The window through
    which Harvinder fell was located in the bedroom of an apartment leased from
    the appellants by his aunt and uncle, Simarjit Kaur Sandu Dhillon and Balvir
    Singh Dhillon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    open sliding sash window through which Harvinder fell had a screen, but the
    screen had a large hole in it and the window lacked a child safety lock.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants knew that the screen was broken for at least three weeks before
    Harvinder’s fall.  The building superintendent, Dave Ferguson, was told about
    the problem more than once and he in turn requested material to repair the
    screen from Lilly Bellicoso, the property manager, more than once.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Dhillons had installed a lock on the bedroom door to keep their children
    and the Sandhu children, who lived down the hall on the same floor with their
    parents, out of the room when unsupervised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the day of the accident, after returning with the children from outside,
    Mrs. Dhillon forgot to lock the door and shut the windows; the children were
    left unsupervised in the living room as she prepared dinner.  Harvinder went
    into the bedroom alone, climbed onto the bed that the Dhillons had placed
    under the window, and, unseen by anyone else, plunged five stories to the
    ground below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Harvinder
    suffered numerous injuries, including a frontal lobe brain injury so severe
    that he will never be gainfully employed and will always require supervision.  Harvinder
    was awarded substantial damages by the jury of $12,936,145.60; the additional
    sum of $4,182,039.02 for guardianship costs, pre and post-judgment interest
    on damages awarded by the jury and costs were added to the award by the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise twelve grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>1.        The jury, in awarding damages for future cost of
    care, awarded an amount which exceeded “the highest amount sought by the
    plaintiffs” of $9.605 million by $1.336 million. The jury’s award was $10.942
    million.  The appellants submit this higher amount was not based on any credible
    evidence or theory of compensatory damages for future care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>2.        The jury awarded non-pecuniary general damages
    at the highest amount permitted by the Supreme Court of Canada of $311,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>3.        The jury awarded $100,000 to each of Harvinder’s
    parents and his brother for their derivative claims pursuant to the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F-3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>4.        The jury awarded
    damages for loss of future income at the highest level based on a retirement
    age of 65.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The appellants say in respect
    of these four issues that the amounts awarded are too high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>5.        The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of
    subsequent remedial measures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>6.        The trial judge erred in improperly holding a <i>voir
      dire</i> on Harvinder’s competence in the absence of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>7.        The trial judge erred in denying the appellants
    access to Harvinder’s teachers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>8.        The trial judge erred in her rulings in excluding
    evidence of the appellants’ expert, Mr. Charles Still, and in relation to
    the scope of evidence from the respondents’
    expert, Dr. Khalid Dinno.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>9.        The trial judge erred in refusing to qualify the
    appellants’ neurodevelopmental expert, Dr. Jo-Anne Finegan, to give expert
    evidence on adult outcomes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>10.      The trial judge erred in permitting the reply evidence
    of Dr. Caroline Lemsky.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>11.      The trial judge’s charge was overly favourable to
    the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The appellants say the cumulative
    effect of these errors improperly influenced the jury and resulted in the
    inflated damage awards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>12.      Based on recent
    Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, the trial judge erred in granting
    a costs premium to the respondents payable by the appellants.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin with the observation of this court in <i>McIntryre v. Grigg</i> (2006)
    83 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 91:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[C]ourts accord great deference to a jury’s findings
    in civil negligence proceedings.  The verdict of a civil jury will not be
    set aside as against the weight of the evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable
    and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury, reviewing the evidence as
    a whole and acting judicially, could have reached it [citations omitted].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the same token a jury verdict will be unjust where there is no evidence to
    support it. Where an appellate court finds such an absence of evidence to
    support a particular verdict the court has the right as well as the duty
    to set that verdict aside.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>The Quantum Issues</span></u></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)  The future care damage
      award exceeded the amount sought by the respondents</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cost of future care to meet Harvinder’s needs was a hotly contested issue
    at trial.  Each side called expert evidence to support the various scenarios
    they urged the jury to accept, the appellants obviously urging lower numbers
    than those advanced on behalf of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main thrust of the appeal on this ground is stated in the appellants’ factum.  After
    listing the various experts called on behalf of the respondents in relation
    to future care costs, the appellants write this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence of these experts was used to build
    up three scenarios for the net present value of future care costs, summarized
    in Exhibit 83. The highest cost scenario contained in Exhibit 83 was a 24-hour,
    at home care for Harvinder, for the rest of his natural life, at market rates
    for caregivers. The caregivers included attendant care, rehabilitation support,
    responsible persons for night-time, speech and language therapist, job coach,
    occupational therapist, physiotherapist, neuropsychology expert, psychology/counselling,
    family support, cognitive rehabilitation, summer activity, case management
    and transportation costs.  The highest cost scenario, calculated based on
    all of the expert testimony for the 24 hour-a-day care for his entire life,
    and the cost of medical supplies and rehabilitation equipment was $9.605
    million over Harvinder’s life expectancy (normal life expectancy).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff made no claim for cost of future
    care above $9.605 million. There was no evidence suggested by plaintiffs’ counsel
    in her closing or reviewed with the jury by the trial judge, indicating that
    a jury verdict above $9.605 million for future cost of care was possible
    on the evidence. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The jury granted a future cost of care award, at
    the highest amount claimed by the plaintiffs, plus a $1.336 million “bonus”,
    giving Harvinder $10.942 million for future cost of care. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The jury was not competent, without reliable expert
    testimony, to increase the legitimate mark of $9.605 million for the cost
    of future care.  The jury could have decreased the future cost of care below
    the $9.605 million using expert testimony that, if accepted, could have decreased
    the award for future cost of care from the highwater mark by removing discrete
    elements of the 24-hour-a-day care or by substituting different models of
    care. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was no expert evidence led permitting the
    jury to fairly and competently grant an award above $9.605 million for future
    cost of care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument is essentially that it is an error for the jury to return a verdict
    for an amount higher than the highest damages scenario put by respondents’ counsel
    to the jury for the cost of future care, and that this is an error of the
    magnitude that calls for this court to set that verdict aside. The appellants
    say there is no expert evidence to support that number.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin with the observation that the jury was only asked to assign a figure
    for the cost of future care; it was not asked to explain how the figure was
    arrived at.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exhibit
    83 was a chart which presented three scenarios or examples of calculations
    of the cost of future care. The figure of $9.605 million was the highest
    dollar figure depicted in the chart, and it was the example that respondents’ counsel,
    in her closing address, suggested that the jury accept.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juries
    are told they may accept some, none or all of the witnesses’ evidence.  This
    jury was not obliged to accept only one of the scenarios presented by counsel
    by way of example. They were free to make their own calculation, provided
    that the calculation was based on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ actuarial expert, Mr. John Siegel, who gave evidence at trial
    explained in his evidence-in-chief, using Exhibit 83, how the jury could
    adjust the figures set out in Exhibit 83 upwards or downwards if they thought
    it appropriate, depending on the evidence they accepted on their assessment
    of the various components of the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the respondents point out in their factum, there was evidence before the
    jury which, if accepted, would result in a higher figure for future care
    cost than the one in the scenario advocated by respondents’ counsel at trial.  Clearly
    there is no obligation on the jury to accept only the suggestions of counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their calculation, the respondents used the hourly rate of $10 for caregiver’s
    earnings.  However, there was evidence from Mr. Douglas Hyatt, the appellants’ expert
    economist, that the hourly rate charged by agencies employing these caregivers
    is $24 per hour.  In addition, while the respondents’ charts used an hourly
    rate of $49 for rehabilitation support workers based on the rate charged
    by Harvinder’s then current tutor, Ms. Heather Ricardo, there was evidence
    from an operator of an agency that his agency charged $49 per hour plus G.S.T.
    for a total hourly rate of $52.43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Changing

    excess of that actually awarded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

  <h3>(2)  The jury awarded non-pecuniary general damages at the highest amount<u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no issue but that at the time of trial the maximum or “cap” for non-pecuniary
    damages, adjusted for inflation, was $311,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that in awarding this sum the jury effectively found that
    Harvinder has experienced, and will throughout his life experience, the greatest
    conceivable amount of pain and suffering.  They submit that awards of this
    size should be reserved for the most serious of cases and that the present
    case falls short of such characterization.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    upper limit for non-pecuniary damages in catastrophic injury cases is not
    to be used as a scale against which non-pecuniary claims for all other injuries
    are to be measured: see <i>Howes v. Crosby </i>(1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 449 (C.A.).  In
    other words, it is inappropriate to evaluate Harvinder’s injuries solely
    on the basis of some notional comparison with an imagined worst case scenario.  While
    awards for non-pecuniary damages in similar cases should achieve a degree
    of consistency and uniformity, this kind of comparative analysis offers only
    limited assistance.  The assessment of non-pecuniary damages ultimately depends
    on the mix of factors peculiar to each particular plaintiff: see <i>Koukounakis
    v. Stainrod</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 299 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent from her charge that the trial judge was of the view that the
    maximum award was appropriate for Harvinder:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because of the severity of Harvinder’s injuries,
    it would be reasonable, in my view, to award the upper limit, or an amount
    that’s very close to this limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to numerous physical injuries, Harvinder suffered a severe and permanent
    injury to the frontal and temporal lobes of his brain.  He will never be
    able to work competitively.  He will never be in any productive setting or
    activity without a support person.  He can never be left alone; he requires
    24-hour care.  For the rest of his natural life he will function at the probable
    equivalent of a twelve-year old.  He has difficulty with attention, concentration,
    memory and processing.  He attends special education classes which focus
    on life and vocational skills and which teach, for example, how to take a
    bus and how to go to a store.  He is, because of his injuries, impulsive,
    distractible and at times oppositional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are of the view that it was appropriate for the jury to award Harvinder the
    maximum considering the nature of his injuries, their permanence and the
    manner in which they have affected the quality of his life.  Further, there
    is precedent for awarding the upper limit for non-pecuniary damages in a
    frontal lobe brain injury case like Harvinder’s: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>Baynton
    v. Rayner</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 1617 (Gen. Div.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

  <h3>(3)  The jury gave high awards pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i><u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While <i>Family Law Act </i>claims are not subject
    to a formal “cap” comparable to that applied to general “pain and suffering” damages,
    they are subject to limits of reasonableness, must fall somewhere within
    the range of damages established in comparable cases, and must be supported
    by evidence of the care guidance and companionship that the family member
    has, in fact, been deprived of.  Damage awards to parents rarely exceed $100,000,
    and such amounts are generally reserved for cases involving the death of
    a child.  Awards of this magnitude to siblings are virtually unheard of and
    are consistently lower than $50,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the risk of repetition, we begin with the observation that each and every
    case must be decided on its own particular facts.  Other cases concerning
    other injuries and other family relationships are of limited assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her charge to the jury the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, there is no cap [or] ceiling in place for
    these family claims as there is for Harvinder’s non-pecuniary damages.  However
    I’m going to offer you the following guidance.  I stress this is my opinion
    as to what is fair and reasonable, and you are not bound to accept it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For the parents an amount of $100,000 each would
    be fair and reasonable in my view.  So that would be $100,000 for the mother,
    $100,000 for the father and for Parminder the brother $50,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent from their answers to the questions that the jury agreed with
    the trial judge’s numbers for the parents’ claims but considered that Parminder’s
    award should be higher and equivalent to that of his parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that, although certainly not determinative of the point, the appellants
    did not submit the quantum of these awards as any part of the basis in support
    of their motion to strike the verdict of the jury immediately following the
    receipt of that verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the awards are at the high end of the range for derivative awards we are
    satisfied that these particular awards are well supported on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Sandhu family is close in every respect. Parminder and his brother were happy
    playmates prior to the accident.  Since then, the contrast in their respective
    abilities is stark.  Parminder no longer has a playmate who is his equal.  He
    is required to include Harvinder in his activities and to provide the necessary
    care and oversight Harvinder requires during these activities.  As a result,
    he has had to sacrifice some of his own independence and ability to interact
    with his peers.  As his parents age, he will assume greater care and concern
    for Harvinder.  In their Punjabi culture it is the responsibility of sons
    to care for their parents; Parminder will not have Harvinder’s support to
    rely on.  Parminder’s commitment will be lifelong and, as the respondents
    note in their factum, “the injury to Harvinder in some ways will affect Parminder
    more profoundly than the death of a sibling”. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Even if, considered individually,

      high, these damage awards fall within acceptable ranges, these awards cannot

      that the jury abdicated its responsibility.  The jury made no honest good
      faith attempt to assess the quantum of damages reasonably required  to
      put the plaintiffs in the position they would have been had the accident
      not occurred.  Rather, in every instance the jury automatically awarded
      the highest amount claimed, and in several instances amounts high than

    consistently equal or exceed the highest amounts claimed, it may be concluded
    that the trial was not fair, but rather that the errors resulted in a significant
    predisposition in favour of the respondents.  Leaving aside the fact that
    we have found no errors in the jury’s damages awards, the appellants cite
    no authority for this somewhat startling proposition.  They argue their submission
    is the corollary of this court’s decision in <i>Landolfi v. Fargione </i>(2006),

    of the trial judge’s errors compromised fundamental trial fairness and rendered
    it far from certain that if the errors had not occurred, the jury would necessarily
    have returned the same verdict.  This court indicated that where such errors
    had occurred, the reasonableness of a jury’s damages award may provide some
    assistance in determining whether, notwithstanding errors in the conduct
    of the trial, the jury nonetheless arrived at a fair and just verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ submission put another way amounts to this: whenever a plaintiff
    is awarded the maximum amounts sought on each claimed head of damage it should
    be concluded the trial was unfair and any errors on the part of the trial
    judge must necessarily have resulted in a significant predisposition in favour
    of the plaintiff, thereby rendering the verdict unreasonable.  In other words
    it would only be in a “perfect” as opposed to “fair” trial where a verdict

    appellants acknowledge that repair of damaged screens was the responsibility
    of the landlord.  The appellants’ property manager agreed that the hole in
    the screen in the Dhillon apartment was a safety hazard.  As we have said,
    there was also evidence that the Dhillons had asked the landlord to fix the
    screen on more than one occasion before the accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    Harvinder’s fall, the appellants took remedial measures.  They immediately
    replaced the screen in the Dhillon apartment by taking a screen from another
    apartment and within days had replaced twenty bedroom screens in eleven other
    apartments.  The cost of the screening material for these repairs was less
    than $150.  Within five days of the fall, they installed child safety latches
    throughout the building at a cost of less than $2,000.  </p>

    has been argued that evidence of subsequent remedial measures should not
    be admissible in a negligence action because it lacks relevance and on policy
    grounds.  These arguments are summarized in the decision of the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Anderson</i><i> v. Maple Ridge (District)</i>, [1993] 1 W.W.R. 172 at
    177.  First, it is argued that the evidence lacks relevance because it shows
    nothing more than a belief by the defendant that the prior condition was
    capable of causing injury.  That belief is either irrelevant or, at best,
    equally consistent with a belief that the injury was in fact caused in some
    other way.  Second, it is argued on policy grounds that if evidence of subsequent
    remedial measures is admitted, defendants would avoid taking corrective measures
    for fear that their actions would be taken as an admission of fault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    will deal with the relevance argument first.  The relevance of any piece
    of evidence depends upon the particular circumstances of each case.  As McLachlin
    J. said in <i>R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at 609:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Relevance must be determined not
      in a vacuum, but in relation to some issue in the trial. Evidence which
      may be relevant to one issue may be irrelevant to another issue. What is
      worse, it may actually mislead the trier of fact on the second issue. Thus
      the same piece of evidence may have value to the trial process but bring
      with it the danger that it may prejudice the fact-finding process on another
      issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impugned evidence in this case provides an example of such a situation.  Apart
    from any inference of an admission of liability, the fact that repairs to
    the screens were made quickly and inexpensively after the accident was relevant
    in other ways.  It was evidence from which the jury could infer that the
    appellants had failed to meet a reasonable standard in keeping the building
    in good repair.  The evidence of repairs could also be evidence of a failure
    to take reasonable care because it was capable of showing that the appellants’
    inspection of the building before the accident failed to meet a reasonable
    standard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the evidence concerning the safety locks was also relevant to the issue of
    reasonable care.  Evidence was led showing that the standard of care required
    installation of child safety locks.  In determining whether the defendants
    acted reasonably in not installing those locks, the cost and ease with which
    such locks could be installed was relevant.  A comparable conclusion was
    reached in <i>James v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it is argued that even if such evidence is relevant, it should be excluded
    for policy reasons.  The policy argument with respect to evidence of remedial
    measures is premised on the theory that defendants would be discouraged from
    taking necessary remedial measures if they knew that these measures would
    be admitted against them at trial as an admission of liability.  Courts have
    tended to discount this policy argument.  As Seaton J.A. said in <i><span

    agree with this statement.  We also note that a similar view of the limited
    value of the policy reason for exclusion has been adopted by courts in this
    province: see <i>e.g. </i><i><span lang=EN>Algoma Central Railway v. Herb

    evidence of subsequent remedial measures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a plaintiff offers evidence of subsequent remedial measures, the trial judge
    must balance the probative value of that evidence against its prejudicial
    effect.  The prejudicial effect includes whatever weight the trial judge
    might give to the policy argument for exclusion, but also includes considerations
    such as whether the evidence will unduly lengthen the trial or may be misused
    by the jury.  In considering the balance between probative value and prejudicial
    effect, the trial judge can take into account whether limiting instructions
    to the jury can mitigate any prejudice.  </p>

    our view, the trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence of subsequent
    remedial measures in this case and she properly directed the jury as to the
    use that could be made of it.  In her ruling on the admissibility of this
    evidence, the trial judge took into account the fact that the appellants’ trial
    counsel did not object to respondents’ counsel’s reference to evidence of
    remedial measures in her opening statement.  The trial judge was entitled
    to consider this failure to make a timely objection as a factor undermining
    the subsequent assertion of prejudice.  In considering the probative value
    of this evidence, the trial judge held that while the evidence could not
    be used as an admission of liability, it was relevant to the issue of the
    nature of steps that could have been taken to reduce the risk.  She concluded
    that any concern regarding the possible misuse of the evidence could be overcome
    by proper limiting instructions to the jury.  In our opinion, the trial judge
    properly applied the test for admissibility of this evidence.  We agree with
    her ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her charge to the jury, the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I want to provide you with some direction on what
    I just said. I must caution you about your use of the evidence about the
    remedial steps that were taken by the Defendants after Harvinder fell. That
    is, replacing the screens and putting child locks on the windows in the building.
    I’m going to call those remedial steps. <i>These remedial steps, as evidence,
    standing on their own, cannot be taken as an admission of liability by the
    Defendants</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>I want to repeat that. They cannot be taken
      as an admission of liability on the part of the Defendants. Just because
      the Defendants took these steps, you don’t jump to the conclusion that
      they are liable. These remedial steps can’t be the basis for a finding
      of liability against the Defendants</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It’s the Plaintiffs’ position that the repair of
    the screen and the child lock installation were effective steps that were
    readily and immediately available at minimal cost to the Defendants.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You can consider the particulars of these remedial
    steps to assist you in determining whether the care the Defendants took before
    Harvinder fell was reasonable in the circumstances to see that Harvinder
    and others were reasonably safe. So the remedial steps are circumstances
    that can be considered along with all of the other evidence relevant to liability.
    It is relevant as to what effective steps the Defendants could have taken
    to make the window safe. For example, the expense and ease of doing the remedial
    work could influence your determination of what was reasonable care in the
    circumstances. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the charge to the jury was correct.  As can be seen, the trial
    judge expressly instructed the jury not to use the evidence as an admission
    of liability, and we agree with that limitation on the use of the evidence.  She
    then went on to instruct the jury as to the permitted uses of the evidence,
    namely, as evidence of what was reasonable in the circumstances and whether
    the appellants took reasonable care.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(6)  Harvinder’s competency <i>voir

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in not conducting the <i>voir
    dire</i> as to Harvinder’s competency to testify in the presence of the jury,
    which deprived the jury of the opportunity to evaluate and assess the mental
    and cognitive abilities demonstrated by Harvinder on the <i>voir dire</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is necessary to consider the context in order to understand this ground of
    appeal.  Near the end of their case, the respondents brought Harvinder to
    court to obtain a ruling from the trial judge as to his competence.  The
    respondents’ purpose in producing Harvinder was unclear.  They had not decided
    whether to call Harvinder and seemed to be considering producing him before
    the jury as demonstrative evidence of his condition.  Appellants’ counsel
    expressed concern about this issue, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here are two concerns expressed there, the first
    being that if the child is effectively brought in as an exhibit and then
    the evidence may not be properly recorded.  So the Court of Appeal would
    be effectively deprived of any evidence.  If the child is being brought in
    so the jury can assess his demeanour, again he’s effectively being used as
    an exhibit, but one which the Court of Appeal would not be able to see.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If he’s being brought into court to show the nature
    and extent of his injuries, that might be more accurately explained by the
    witnesses who have given oral testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    submissions from counsel, the trial judge decided to hold the <i>voir dire</i> in
    the absence of the jury.  Not surprisingly, given his position, appellants’ counsel
    did not object.  Following the <i>voir dire</i>, respondents’ counsel announced
    that she had decided not to call Harvinder as a witness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day, appellants’ counsel stated that he wanted the trial judge
    to rule on Harvinder’s competency, but he refused to disclose whether he
    intended to call Harvinder until after the trial judge had ruled.  The trial
    judge stated that she needed to know the purpose for which the appellants
    might call Harvinder and that the issue remained open.  She did not make
    a ruling and appellants’ counsel did not seek to revisit the issue.  In the
    end, neither party called Harvinder to testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not err in holding the competency <i>voir dire</i> in
    the absence of the jury.  As noted by the trial judge, holding competency <i>voir
    dires</i> in the presence of the jury is the general practice, but is not
    mandatory. The reason for this general practice is that if the witness is
    found to be competent, the jury will have had the benefit of the witness’ answers
    in assessing the reliability of his or her testimony.  Holding a competency <i>voir
    dire</i> in the jury’s presence thus saves time by avoiding the need to repeat
    this testimony.  However, since in the end Harvinder was never called as
    a witness, there was no prejudice to the parties or to the efficient management
    of the case in not conducting the <i>voir dire</i> in the presence of the
    jury.   In addition, the trial judge’s decision ensured that the <i>voir
    dire</i> was not used as a vehicle to present Harvinder before the jury as
    if he were an exhibit, particularly in the absence of a clear purpose for
    calling him as a witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    given the appellants’ position at trial, they should not now be heard to
    complain about the procedure.  This is especially so since it is likely the
    trial judge adopted the procedure that she did in order to minimize prejudice
    to the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    give no effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(7)  The trial judge refused
      to compel Harvinder’s teachers to speak to counsel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in denying them access to Harvinder’s
    teachers.  Again, the context is important to understand this issue.  Prior
    to trial, the respondents produced all of Harvinder’s school records.  The
    appellants then sought an order, in part pursuant to r. 30.10 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, requiring Harvinder’s teachers
    to respond to a detailed questionnaire.  Master MacLeod dismissed the motion
    and the appellants did not appeal his order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the first week of trial, counsel for the appellants contacted the principal
    of Harvinder’s school in an attempt to interview Harvinder’s teachers.  The
    principal agreed to meet with counsel on condition that she be present to
    moderate any meetings and that the teachers could decline to participate.  Only
    Harvinder’s current teacher, Ms. Melissa Sherman, agreed to meet with  appellants’
    counsel and they had a short meeting moderated by the principal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    learning of this meeting, respondents’ counsel brought a motion to prohibit
    any future attempts by the appellants to interview teachers.  Appellants’ counsel
    undertook not to make any such further attempt and the motion lay in abeyance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    after Ms. Sherman had testified for the respondents and the appellants had
    opened their case, the appellants sought a ruling on the respondents’ motion
    to prohibit any future attempts to interview teachers.  In addition, appellants’ counsel
    seemed to be seeking a ruling to compel Harvinder’s teachers to submit to
    interviews, although the legal basis for the request was unclear and he conceded
    that the teachers could decline the interviews. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    this backdrop, the trial judge treated this as a motion to compel Harvinder’s
    teachers to submit to the interviews, and ruled that she would not compel
    the teachers to speak to appellants’ counsel.  She noted that they were now
    in the fifth week of the trial, that the appellants had not appealed from
    Master MacLeod’s order, and that teachers owe a duty of confidentiality to
    their students under the <i>Education Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2, s. 266.  The
    trial judge therefore held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A teacher who is subpoenaed must attend and, in
    the witness stand, is required to answer questions.  <i>There is no obligation
    to answer questions that counsel might have prior to the teacher testifying.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In denying this relief I want to emphasize that
    the defendants have had full access to the school records and the opportunity
    to cross-examine Mrs. Sherman, Harvinder’s teacher.  This is not a situation
    where an interview with Harvinder’s teacher is the only way the defendants
    would have had access to the teachers. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that they had a <i>prima facie</i> right to interview Harvinder’s
    teachers and that the trial judge’s ruling was, in the words of their factum, “tantamount
    to an injunction prohibiting defence counsel from contacting Harvinder’s
    teachers and gathering evidence essential to make full answer and defence.”  They
    submit that the trial judge should have made an order authorizing counsel
    to interview Harvinder’s teachers and that the confidentiality provisions
    of the <i>Education Act</i> did not apply in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot give effect to this ground of appeal.  The trial judge’s refusal to
    compel the teachers to speak to defence counsel cannot be equated to forbidding
    defence counsel from approaching the teachers.  The appellants did not require
    the permission of the court to speak to the teachers, and indeed they attempted
    to do so, but the teachers were under no obligation to cooperate. We also
    do not agree that the appellants had a right to interview the teachers.  While
    there is no property in a witness, equally no potential witness can be forced
    to speak to counsel outside the courtroom unless the court makes such an
    order in accordance with statutory or common law rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants had sought paper discovery of the teachers, relying in part on
    r. 30.10, but that attempt failed and they did not appeal.  The appellants
    had tried to interview the teachers, but the teachers refused, as was their
    right.  The appellants may have sought discovery of the teachers as non-parties
    under r. 31.10, but the respondents correctly point out that it was far too
    late to embark on that process in the fifth week of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants have failed to show how they were prejudiced by the ruling.  While
    they complain that they were deprived of the ability to make full answer
    and defence, they have not demonstrated any basis for this assertion.  The
    appellants had all of Harvinder’s school records and had the opportunity
    to meet with and later cross-examine Ms. Sherman.  They have not shown by
    reference to the records or any other material how the opportunity to interview
    the other teachers would have assisted their defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(8)  The trial judge’s rulings

    appellants sought to call Mr. Still as an expert witness in the design, manufacture
    and testing of window screens and windows.  Mr. Still was an architect and
    had worked for many years in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    designing doors and windows.  He was not an engineer and had no expertise
    with respect to the science of forces.  He was familiar with United States
    and international building standards, but had no familiarity with Canadian
    building codes generally or the <i>Ontario Building Code</i>, O. Reg. 403/97,
    in particular.  The effect of his evidence would have been that the kind
    of screen used in the Dhillon apartment was effective for keeping out insects
    but was not intended to protect children from falling out of windows.  His
    opinion, based on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    and international building codes, was that window screens serve no safety
    function.  He had no knowledge of the <i>Ontario Building Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were a number of problems with Mr. Still’s proposed evidence.  He purported
    to give an opinion as to how Harvinder fell and that the cause of the accident
    was the fault of the Dhillons rather than the landlord.  This part of his
    opinion was little more than speculation and would have usurped the role
    of the jury.  Although Mr. Still’s opinion on the manner and cause of the
    accident was mere speculation, the appellants submit that Mr. Still should
    have been allowed to testify on the more narrow issues of industry standards
    relating to window screens and the purpose of window screens.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that Mr. Still could not testify.  She held that his opinion
    did not satisfy the requirements of necessity and relevancy and that he lacked
    the qualifications to render an expert opinion on the standard of care in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or on the physical forces relevant to causation.  In particular,
    the trial judge rejected Mr. Still’s opinion concerning the purpose of window
    screens because it was not relevant to the Canadian context.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    is not required to testify to the contents of building codes, which are public
    documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in rejecting Mr. Still’s qualifications
    on the basis that he had no Canadian experience and no familiarity with Canadian
    building codes. They further submit that the necessity and relevancy requirements
    were clearly met since the trial judge had previously ruled that Dr. Dinno,
    the respondents’ expert, could testify on similar matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the trial judge erred in excluding Mr. Still’s evidence on the
    narrow issue of standards in the industry, including the purpose of window
    screens.  Ordinarily, lack of experience in Canadian standards should not
    disqualify an expert from giving evidence about standards in the industry.  A
    lack of Canadian experience merely goes to the weight to be attached to the
    evidence.  However, we are also satisfied that this error did not affect
    the verdict, because of the limited value of Mr. Still’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Still’s lack of expertise with local standards rendered his evidence of limited
    value in addressing the standard of care.  For example, the uncontradicted
    evidence was that since 1986, the <i>Ontario Building Code</i> required window
    protection to minimize hazards to children in apartment buildings.  This
    protection included a requirement that there be a “heavy duty screen”.  While
    the <i>Ontario Building Code</i> was not determinative of the standard of
    care,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    of reasonable conduct”: see <i>Canada v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i>, [1983]
    1 S.C.R. 205 at 228.  Mr. Still could give no useful evidence that would
    have undermined the impact of this fact.  Further, the appellants’ own witnesses
    had conceded that the tear in the window screen was a safety defect.  </p>

    of force.  He had also worked frequently with building codes and he had passed
    the 2003 building code structural exams that included topics dealing with
    occupant safety and window protection in apartment buildings.  However, as

    screen, the fact that an intact screen would have been able to prevent the

    agree with the trial judge’s ruling.  The threshold for qualification as
    an expert is whether the witness has “acquired special or peculiar knowledge
    through study or experience in respect of the matters on which he or she
    undertakes to testify”: see <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 at 25.  A
    witness may be qualified to give evidence in respect of one area but not
    qualified in a related area because he or she does not possess this special
    knowledge and experience.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, it was open to the trial judge on the record to find that Dr.
    Finegan did not have the requisite expertise to give evidence about adult
    outcomes for children with acquired brain injury.  Dr. Finegan had no special
    or peculiar knowledge either through study or experience in such matters.  To
    the contrary, her <i>voir dire</i> testimony demonstrated that when such
    issues arose, she referred the patients and their parents to other experts.  At
    most, she seems to have had some impression about adult outcomes from later
    hearing back from parents.  For example, she gave the following answers in
    cross-examination on the qualification <i>voir dire</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parents would call me and ask me for the names
    of vocational… people to provide vocational assessment and job coaches and
    I would give them the names that I’m aware of.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Specific interventions, as I said earlier, I don’t
    know how a speech language pathologist for an adult would propose a treatment
    plan.  I don’t know how an [occupational therapist]… [would] propose a treatment
    plan.  I don’t know a physiotherapist, whether they would propose a treatment
    plan, those specific things with adults is outside my area of expertise,
    yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I know how [job coaching] has worked with many

    it’s not something I do, correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also agree with the respondents’ position that even if the trial judge erred
    in failing to qualify Dr. Finegan to testify about adult outcomes, the error
    was of no consequence.  Given Dr. Finegan’s obvious lack of expertise in
    the area, it is not reasonable to believe that the jury would have accorded
    any weight to that part of her testimony, had she been allowed to give it.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in permitting the respondents
    to recall Dr. Lemsky to give reply evidence.  The trial judge ruled that
    the respondents could call Dr. Lemsky in reply to respond to the appellants’ evidence
    concerning job coaching, the use of Alarm Force and Life Line as a substitute
    for overnight live-in care, and the level of care that could be provided
    by an inexperienced caregiver.  The trial judge was of the view that the
    appellants’ position respecting these issues had not been disclosed prior
    to trial, and further that the appellants’ position had evolved during their
    case.  In fact, when the respondents objected to the admissibility of the
    appellants’ evidence on those issues because of the late disclosure, appellants’ counsel
    stated that any prejudice to the respondents could be overcome by permitting
    the respondents to call reply evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to the proper principles relating to reply evidence.  She
    was well aware that plaintiffs are not entitled to split their case.  But
    she also recognized that she had a discretion to permit reply evidence where
    the defence has raised some new matter or defence that the plaintiff had
    no opportunity to deal with and which the plaintiff could not reasonably
    have anticipated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    could reasonably have anticipated the matters raised in the appellants’ defence.  We
    are not  persuaded that she misapprehended the record.  In so finding, we
    think it appropriate to place weight on the fact that the appellants seemed
    to acknowledge at trial, initially at least, that these were new matters
    and that reply evidence would be appropriate.  As the trial judge noted in
    her detailed reasons on the reply evidence issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parties who choose to develop their evidence as
    their case is proceeding run the risk that prejudice will be caused to the
    other side that can only be cured in a fair manner by allowing reply evidence.  Although

    they clearly recognized that this was the risk they were running when leave

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first objection is in relation to the issue of liability.  The appellants
    submit that having improperly excluded the expert evidence of Mr. Still and
    having been overly permissive in relation to the evidence of Dr. Dinno, the
    trial judge exacerbated her errors by pointing out the absence of defence
    evidence on liability and by failing to give an appropriate cautionary instruction
    concerning Dr. Dinno’s lack of expertise in relation to window screens. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    conclusions concerning the admissibility of this evidence are dispositive
    of these submissions.  Although we agree that Mr. Still’s evidence in relation
    to the narrow issue of industry standards should not have been excluded,
    we have concluded that there is no realistic possibility that his evidence
    on this point could have affected the jury’s verdict.  In these circumstances,
    the trial judge’s statement to the jury that the appellants did not “present
    any contrary expert opinion about the standard of care in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario” occasioned no prejudice to the appellants.  Further, given our conclusion
    upholding the trial judge’s ruling on the scope of Dr. Dinno’s evidence,
    we are of the view that the trial judge was not obliged to give a limiting
    instruction concerning his evidence. </p>

    trial judge effectively invited the jury to give little weight to the evidence
    of the appellants’ expert, Dr. Shevell, concerning Harvinder’s prognosis
    and needs for the future.  The trial judge unduly emphasized Dr. Shevell’s
    expertise with children while at the same time failing to point out that
    the respondents’ expert, Dr. Lemsky, did not conduct a personal assessment
    of Harvinder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    failing to use similar qualifying words relating to the respondents’ witnesses

    reject these submissions. In our view, the trial judge’s description was
    not unfair.  The appellants have not challenged the accuracy of the trial
    judge’s description of Dr. Shevell’s experience.  Moreover, the trial judge
    stated explicitly that Dr. Shevell had conducted an assessment of Harvinder;
    the absence of a similar statement in relation to Dr. Lemsky’s evidence,
    as well as the trial judge’s comments that Dr. Lemsky had reviewed the medical
    records and neuropsychological testing that others had done, would have made
    it obvious to the jury that Dr. Lemsky had not conducted an in-person assessment. </p>

    for the failure to summarize the evidence of the lay witnesses, in our view,
    the main issue in dispute was the level of care that Harvinder required and
    not whether the appellants’ proposal for providing the level they suggested
    was realistic.  In this regard, we note that the trial judge also did not
    refer to the evidence of the respondents’ witnesses who testified about how
    Harvinder’s needs could be met if the level of care they suggested was accepted.  There
    was no imbalance in this aspect of her charge.  In these circumstances, we
    are not persuaded that the trial judge erred by failing to summarize the
    evidence of the lay witnesses.</p>

    see no merit in the appellants’ submissions concerning the trial judge’s
    summary of the parties’ positions on future care costs.  Based on our review,
    in summarizing the respondents’ position on this issue, the trial judge used
    the terminology “the plaintiffs say” and “the plaintiffs’ position” eleven
    times over approximately four and a half pages of transcript.  While she
    used similar terminology more frequently when setting out the appellants’ position,
    there is simply no air of reality to the suggestion that this difference
    created any unfairness to the appellants.  Based on the trial judge’s language,
    it would have been obvious to the jury that the trial judge was summarizing

    197 O.A.C. 81, rev’d [2006] 2 S.C.R. 428.  The Supreme Court of Canada subsequently
    reversed this court’s decision and held that as r. 57.01 stood at the time,

    into minutes of settlement by which the respondents were entitled to their
    costs on a partial indemnity scale up to the date of the respondents’ offer
    to settle and thereafter on a substantial indemnity scale.  The costs were
    fixed at just over $1 million with disbursements of approximately $230,000.  </p>

    only be awarded  where the plaintiff has been awarded substantial indemnity
    costs, counsel have achieved an outstanding result and there was a possible
    risk of non-payment of fees.  The trial judge found that these criteria were
    met and awarded a total premium of $1 million, with a solicitor-client premium

    criteria under r. 57.01 would allow the court to take into account other
    factors including the amount recovered, the complexity of the matter, and
    the importance of the issues.  They submit that taking these additional factors

    undertaken by respondents’ counsel.  As she said at para. 51 of the costs
    decision, reported at (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 307 at para. 51, costs premiums “are
    awarded to recognize the financial risk assumed by counsel to provide impecunious

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ original proposal that $5.12 million of Harvinder’s award be
    invested in the capital market was premised on expert evidence concerning
    the cost of annuities and increasing health care costs.  The respondents’ evidence
    demonstrated that the cost of an annuity indexed at the estimated long-term
    inflation rate of 3.5% would cost $11,567,893.68, while the cost of an annuity
    that would cover Harvinder’s future care needs and that was fully indexed
    for inflation would cost $15 million.  Both annuities cost well in excess
    of the $10,942,908 amount awarded to Harvinder for future care costs.  In
    addition, the respondents’ evidence indicated that the cost of health care
    services was increasing somewhat faster than the estimated long-term inflation
    rate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the annuity costs and the estimated long-term inflation rate, the respondents
    proposed investing $7.5 million in an affordable annuity indexed at 2% for
    inflation and that the remaining $5.12 million be invested in a balanced
    capital portfolio.  Based on the historical performance of balanced capital
    funds over the preceding thirty years, the respondents projected that the
    $5.12 million investment would produce a rate of return that would offset
    the difference between long-term inflation and the 2% indexing provided by
    the proposed annuity.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her April 20, 2006 ruling, the trial judge held that r. 7.09(1) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, requiring that a minor’s award be paid into court,
    was the starting point for the analysis.  She noted that Harvinder was eleven
    years old and had a normal life expectancy.  She observed that the stream
    of payments from an annuity could be guaranteed to continue for Harvinder’s
    life and would not be exposed to the risk of a poorly performing market or
    the poor performance of an investment manager.  She concluded that using
    thirty years of data to predict the next seventy years would not give her “the
    comfort level” she needed to approve “such a significant departure from rule
    7.09(1).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge stated that the respondents’ investment proposal
    was driven by their experts’ opinion that “the annuity [could] not protect
    against the inflationary pressures on health care costs”.  However, she noted
    that the respondents’ expert had testified at trial that the discount rate
    prescribed in r. 53.09(1) had taken into account the difference between estimated
    investment interest and inflation rates. Accordingly, she ruled that the
    respondents should have led evidence at trial indicating that health care
    costs are increasing at a faster rate than inflation and asked for a different
    discount rate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge noted that respondents’
    counsel had not asked for a gross-up for income tax on the future care award
    at trial based on an assumption that all of Harvinder’s future care award
    would be invested in an annuity and therefore not subject to income tax. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (c)       <i>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her June 16, 2006 ruling directing that the balance of Harvinder’s award
    be invested in the capital market, the trial judge found that paying the
    money into court would not be in Harvinder’s best interests because that
    procedure is cumbersome and expensive.  Further, given that she had “secured
    the future care award in an annuity,” she concluded that it would be “prudent
    to have the degree of flexibility that a $3 million capital fund will offer”.  In
    this regard, she pointed to “the changes in the marketplace and the advances
    that have occurred in the last 70 years” and indicated that it would be preferable
    that Harvinder’s guardians have the flexibility to respond to changes in
    the future.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (d)       <i>The
        grounds of cross-appeal </i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that the trial judge made three errors in her April 20,
    2006 ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    she erred in treating r. 7.09(1) as the starting point for her analysis because
    that provision is aimed at ensuring that awards in favour of minors are administered
    in their best interest; it offers no guidance as to what type of investment
    strategy is appropriate.  The question of whether payment into court is in
    the best interests of the person under disability is quite different from
    the question of the best investment strategy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    she failed to appreciate that the r. 53.09(1) present-value calculation is
    entirely distinct from the investment strategy issue.  The present-value
    calculation under r. 53.09(1) converts the amount of a plaintiff’s losses
    for expenses that will be incurred in the future into present-day dollars
    as of the date of judgment.  It involves determining the present value of
    the future care costs based on prescribed rates of interest and inflation;
    in contrast, the investment strategy issue concerns whether the annuities
    available to structure future payments will provide adequate protection against
    inflation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    she ignored the fact that the only evidence before her indicated that an
    investment strategy with a capital fund component was more likely to protect
    the integrity of the award than investing all of it in an annuity indexed
    at only 2%.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (e)       <i>Analysis </i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we agree that the trial judge made some of the errors alleged, on balance
    we are not persuaded that she erred in exercising her discretion in the way
    that she did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first issue, we agree that r. 7.09 was of limited value to the trial
    judge’s analysis.  That provision deals with payment into court and offers
    no guidance as to what type of investment strategy is appropriate.  Rather
    than focussing on r. 7.09(1), the focus of the trial judge’s analysis should
    have been on s. 116 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C.43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    116 deals with the circumstances under which a court should order damages
    to be paid on a periodic basis rather than a lump sum basis in personal injury
    cases.  Section 116(1)(b) provides that where the plaintiff makes a claim
    for income tax gross-up, the court must order a structured award unless it
    is demonstrated that such an award would not be in the plaintiff’s best interests.  Although
    the respondents did not expressly request a gross-up for income tax on the
    income from the future care award, as was noted by the trial judge, that
    was because respondents’ counsel assumed the award would be structured. The
    obvious basis for counsel’s assumption was that, absent a structured annuity,
    a gross-up would be necessary to maintain the integrity of the award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    the circumstances, we agree that the requirements of s. 116(1)(b) of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i> were satisfied: see <i>Chesher v. Monaghan</i> (2000),
    48 O.R. (3d) 451 at para. 7 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), in which this court held that the triggering event under s. 116(1)(b)
    is the request for a gross-up, either “express or implied”.  That said, as
    we read her reasons, the trial judge’s main concern was Harvinder’s best
    interests, and that is the proper focus of the analysis under s. 116.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the second issue, in our view, the trial judge made no error when
    she found that to the extent that the respondents relied on health care costs
    increasing at a faster rate than the general inflation rate as the basis
    for their investment strategy proposal, they could and should have led that
    evidence at trial and asked for a different discount rate: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>Walker
    v. Ritchie </i>at paras. 88 and 91 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), rev’d on other grounds; and <i>Roberts v. Morana</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d)
    647 (Gen. Div.), aff’d (2000), 187 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    present-value calculation under r. 53.09(1) assumes that the award will earn
    interest equivalent to the average rate of interest for long-term Government
    of Canada bonds but discounts this rate of growth by the estimated long-term
    inflation rate.  To the extent that a plaintiff believes that r. 53.09(1)
    does not accurately convert the cost of specific expenses to be incurred
    in the future into present-day dollars because the costs for those expense
    are increasing at a rate faster than the estimated long-term inflation rate,
    that is a factor that affects the quantum of the award for the specific expenses
    and is an issue that should be raised at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, however, the trial judge erred by failing to appreciate that the
    difference between the estimated long-term inflation rate for health care
    expenses and the general estimated long-term inflation rate was not the sole
    basis of the respondents’ investment strategy proposal.  Rather, their proposal
    was also based on the submission that there was no affordable annuity available
    to protect Harvinder’s award against the estimated general long-term inflation
    rate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    on the facts of this case, we are not persuaded that we should interfere
    with the trial judge’s order concerning the quantum of funds to be invested
    in a structured annuity.  Based on either the second or third error relied
    on by the respondents, in the particular circumstances of this case, we are
    not satisfied that the trial judge erred by focussing on the advantages of
    the security of an annuity as opposed to any requirement to offset the risks
    of inflation.  Future care costs are awarded on the basis of a real and substantial
    risk that the expense will be incurred.  Particularly since the jury awarded
    an amount for future care costs in excess of the maximum that respondents’ counsel
    suggested to the jury, we consider that the trial judge’s approach of maintaining
    a higher proportion of Harvinder’s award in a secure investment vehicle was
    appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    summary, save in relation to the costs premium issue, the appeal is dismissed.  On
    the costs premium issue, the trial judge’s order is set aside and an order
    awarding a costs premium of $50,000 is substituted.  The cross-appeal on
    the investment strategy issue is dismissed.  The solicitors’ contingent cross-appeal
