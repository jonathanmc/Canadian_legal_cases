    Ontario Health Insurance Plan (“OHIP”) is funded by a tax imposed on employers
    pursuant to the <i>Employer Health Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.11 as amended
    (the “<i>Act</i>”).  Section 2(2) of the <i>Act</i> provides that the tax
    is to be calculated as a percentage of the “taxable total

    Canada Ltd. is part of a worldwide multi-national group of affiliated IBM
    companies, all of which are controlled by International Business Machines
    Corporation.  IBM Canada has a permanent business establishment in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  From time to time, persons employed by IBM Canada take assignments
    to work abroad for one of IBM Canada’s foreign affiliates.  These assignments
    can last from one to five years.  While on assignment, these persons, referred
    to by IBM Canada as expatriates, live in the foreign country and work exclusively
    for the foreign affiliate.  They are paid by IBM Canada, which is reimbursed
    by the foreign affiliate.  </p>

    Minister assessed IBM Canada under the <i>Act</i> on the money it paid to
    the expatriates while they were working for the foreign affiliate.  IBM Canada
    asked the Minister to reconsider that assessment.  He did so and affirmed
    his initial assessment.  </p>

    Canada appealed the Minister’s assessment to the Superior Court of Justice
    pursuant to s. 10(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  It advanced two arguments.  First,
    IBM Canada argued that the expatriates were not employees of IBM Canada while
    they were working for the foreign affiliate.  Second, IBM Canada argued that
    even if the expatriates remained employees of IBM Canada while working abroad,
    they were not remunerated by IBM Canada since they worked exclusively for
    the foreign affiliate who reimbursed IBM Canada for all payments it made
    to the expatriate.  If either argument advanced by IBM Canada carried the
    day, it did not owe tax under the <i>Act</i> on monies paid to expatriates
    while they were working abroad for foreign affiliates.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    two issues came before Campbell J. by way of four appeals (one for each taxation
    year between 1996 and 1999) and an application brought by IBM Canada for
    declaratory relief.  The issues of statutory interpretation raised on the
    application for declaratory relief were identical to those raised on the
    appeal.</p>

    Campbell J. held that IBM Canada was not liable for the tax assessed by the
    Minister.  He held that although the expatriates remained employees of IBM
    Canada while working for the foreign affiliate, they were not remunerated
    by IBM Canada when working for the foreign affiliate.  The conclusions reached
    by Campbell J. are captured in the declaratory relief he granted on the application:</p>

    Minister appeals.  Counsel for the Minister submits that while Campbell J.
    correctly concluded that the expatriates were employees of IBM Canada while
    they were working for the foreign affiliate, he erred in holding that the
    money paid to the expatriates by IBM Canada did not constitute “remuneration
    paid” for the purposes of determining IBM Canada’s liability for taxation
    under the <i>Act</i>.  </p>

    Canada supports Campbell J.’s conclusion that IBM Canada did not pay remuneration
    to the expatriates while they were on assignment to the foreign affiliate.  However,
    by way of cross-appeal, IBM Canada challenges the finding that IBM Canada
    was an employer of the expatriates while they were working for the foreign
    affiliate.  Counsel for IBM Canada correctly takes the position that success
    by IBM Canada either in resisting the Minister’s appeal or on its cross-appeal
    means that IBM Canada does not owe the tax assessed by the Minister.</p>

    would allow the Minister’s appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.  For the
    reasons that follow, I agree with the holding below that IBM Canada and its
    expatriates remain in an employer/employee relationship while the expatriates
    are working abroad for foreign affiliates.  Consequently, I would dismiss
    the cross-appeal.  However, I cannot agree that the monies paid by IBM Canada
    to expatriates do not constitute “remuneration paid” for the purposes of
    the <i>Act</i>.  In my view, payments made by IBM Canada are caught by, and
    taxable under, the <i>Act</i>.  Consequently, I would allow the appeal.</p>

    indicated above, employees of IBM Canada, referred to as expatriates, are
    from time to time assigned to IBM affiliate companies in other countries  The  assignments
    arise when it is determined that an IBM Canada employee has a particular
    skill set needed by one of IBM Canada’s foreign affiliates.  There are various
    arrangements that IBM Canada and the foreign affiliate can enter into to
    make the services of the IBM Canada employee available to the foreign affiliate.  The
    assignments in issue in these proceedings arise out of what IBM Canada refers
    to as “Type B” assignments.  IBM Canada’s internal documentation describes  this
    kind of assignment in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Assignments for
    the prime benefit of the work location country <u>where assignees are treated
    as employees of the work location country.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Such assignees
    may perform the same functions as regular employees of the work location
    countries, including the ability to incur commitments <i>vis-à-vis</i> third
    parties.  <u>Such assignees remain employees of their home country (headcount
    on the Canadian inactive strength) since they continue to be subject to the
    benefit programs, salary plans and applicable tax withholdings of their home
    country.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>

    of IBM Canada who go on foreign assignment live in the foreign country, work
    exclusively for the foreign affiliate, and are under the day-to-day direction
    and supervision of the foreign affiliate.  Normally, the foreign affiliate
    approaches IBM Canada to obtain the services of the employee.  The employee
    goes to work for the foreign affiliate only if IBM Canada, the foreign affiliate,
    and the employee all agree to the assignment.  The employee is guaranteed
    employment with IBM Canada when the assignment is complete, although it may
    be at a different position or location in

    foreign affiliate is not a party to the terms of the letter and does not

    service allowance earned by the expatriate.  These monies are deposited in
    Canadian funds by IBM Canada’s payroll department into the expatriate’s Canadian

    a salary freeze is in effect for employees of IBM Canada, that freeze will
    apply to the expatriate while he or she is working with a foreign affiliate.  Entitlement
    to merit raises is based on performance evaluations done by the foreign affiliate.  However,
    the quantification of any merit increase is based on IBM Canada’s salary
    band and payments are calculated according to IBM Canada’s payout tables.  The
    expatriate may be eligible while on foreign assignment to receive overtime
    payments based on IBM Canada’s compensation package.  </p>

    foreign affiliate enters into an intercompany agreement with IBM Canada whereby
    the foreign affiliate agrees to reimburse IBM Canada for all payments made
    to the expatriate.  That agreement is between IBM Canada and the foreign
    affiliate.  The expatriate is not a party to that agreement.  </p>

    definition of “total

    <st1:place

    Ontario remuneration” and, therefore, taxable only if an employee/employer
    relationship existed between the expatriate and IBM Canada at the time the
    payment was made by IBM Canada.   In addition, even if an employee/employer
    relationship exists, the payments will attract tax under the <i>Act</i> only
    if they constitute “remuneration paid”.  The first inquiry looks to the relationship
    between the payor and the payee.  The second inquiry examines the character

    set out by LeBel J., the interpretation of a taxing statute begins with the
    words used in the statute.  If the words are precise and unequivocal then
    the words used will dominate, and may well determine, the interpretative
    exercise.  No statutory text is, however, an island to be considered in isolation.  The
    purpose animating the legislation and the context in which the statute operates
    may assist in identifying the meaning of the text.  The role of context and
    purpose in the interpretative process increases as the clarity of the language
    used decreases.  </p>

    the argument that any one facet of the tripartite relationship among the

    observation (at para. 34) that the existence of employer/employee features
    in the relationship between the foreign affiliate and the expatriate does
    not necessarily mean that there is no employer/employee relationship between
    IBM Canada and the expatriate.   No risk of double taxation under the <i>Act</i> arises

    review of all of the factors relevant to the ongoing relationship between
    IBM Canada and the expatriate leaves no doubt that their relationship is
    one of employer and employee while the expatriate is on assignment abroad.  Having
    read the extensive international assignment documentation prepared by IBM
    Canada, I think IBM employees and personnel managers would be very surprised
    at any suggestion that an expatriate ceases to be an employee of IBM Canada
    when he or she goes on a temporary assignment abroad.  In addition to the
    overall tenor of that documentation, I rely on the following specific factors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    before and after the assignment, the expatriate is in every sense of the
    word an employee of IBM Canada.  The assignment is temporary and for a fixed
    period.  From the outset, the intention is that the expatriate will return
    to IBM Canada and IBM Canada will reintegrate the expatriate into its operation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    foreign affiliate is no stranger to the employer/employee relationship between
    the expatriate and IBM Canada.  There is an obvious and close corporate connection
    between the foreign affiliate and IBM Canada.  The expatriate remains within
    the IBM Canada family when he or she goes on temporary assignment abroad.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    contractual relationship whereby the expatriate provides services to the
    foreign affiliate in exchange for wages and other benefits is exclusively
    between the expatriate and IBM Canada.  The expatriate would have no contractual
    claim against the foreign affiliate for any breach of the conditions and
    terms of the letter of assignment.  Nor would the foreign affiliate have
    a claim in contract against the expatriate for any breach of the terms of
    that letter.  Specifically, IBM Canada assumes the responsibility to pay
    the expatriate’s wages, bonuses and other benefits.  The foreign affiliate’s
    promise to reimburse IBM Canada for those payments in no way diminishes IBM
    Canada’s direct obligation to the expatriate.</p>

    only does IBM Canada remain directly responsible to the expatriate for payment
    of wages and other benefits, IBM Canada retains a large measure of control
    over the amount of remuneration paid to the expatriate while he or she is

    of any bonuses are both determined by IBM Canada’s salary bands and payout
    schedules.</p>

    other terms of the foreign assignment further confirm the ongoing employer/employee
    relationship between the expatriate and IBM Canada.  The expatriate continues
    to participate in IBM Canada’s pension, medical, dental and stock option
    plans.  Canada Pension Plan contributions are made on behalf of the expatriate
    while he or she is abroad.  Any termination of employment while on foreign
    assignment is ultimately in the hands of IBM Canada, and any severance package
    is the responsibility of IBM Canada.</p>

    I understand IBM Canada’s argument, it does not dispute the assertion that
    a comprehensive consideration of the factors that define the relationship
    between IBM Canada and the expatriate compels the conclusion that their relationship
    was one of employer and employee.  Rather, IBM Canada argues that the definition
    of employee in the <i>Act</i> limits consideration to one factor only – does
    the expatriate, while on foreign assignment, provide services to IBM Canada?  On
    IBM Canada’s argument, if no services were provided by the expatriate to
    IBM Canada, the expatriate could not for the purposes of the <i>Act</i> be
    the employee of IBM Canada regardless of the actual nature of their relationship.  IBM
    Canada submits that the expatriate provides services exclusively to the foreign
    affiliate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    argument rests on the definition of employee found in the <i>Act</i> prior
    to certain amendments, that came into force December 5, 2001 (S.O. 2001,
    c. 23, s. 71(2)).  Prior to those amendments, an employee was defined as “an
    individual employed by and in the service of an employer”.  The amendments
    deleted the words “in the service of”.  Since it is agreed that the 2001
    amendments that eliminated the phrase “in the service of” did not alter the
    substance of the definition, counsel for IBM Canada reasons that the requirement
    that the individual be in the service of the employer remains a prerequisite
    to a finding of an employer/employee relationship under the <i>Act</i>.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot accept this method of statutory interpretation.  Counsel’s argument
    requires that the words deleted from the statute in 2001 be read back into
    the statute and be used to limit the scope of the words left in the statute
    after the 2001 amendments.  The parties agreed, both before Campbell J. and
    on appeal, that the 2001 amendments did not alter the substance of the definition
    of employee in the <i>Act</i>.  I come to the same conclusion.  It must follow
    that the deleted phrase “in the service of” added nothing to the words “employed
    by”
    left in place after the amendment.  The words in the statute and not the
    words removed from the statute control the interpretation to be given to
    the statute.</p>

    would add that even were I to accept IBM Canada’s argument as to the reading
    of the statute, I should not be taken as necessarily agreeing with the submission
    that the expatriate does not provide services to IBM Canada while working
    for the foreign affiliate.  The expatriate goes on assignment with the consent
    of, and perhaps at the request of, IBM Canada.  Presumably, the assignment
    program in which IBM Canada participates benefits IBM Canada.  It is arguable
    that the expatriate does perform a service for IBM Canada when he or she
    goes on assignment to work for the foreign affiliate.  I need not decide
    that issue.   </p>

    challenging the ruling below, counsel for the Minister presented an intricate
    argument that drew a distinction between the meaning of the word “remunerate”,
    which is not used in the <i>Act</i> and the phrases “pays remuneration” and “remuneration
    paid”
    which are found in the <i>Act</i>.  Counsel submits that the word “remunerate”
    may invite some consideration of who bears the ultimately economic burden
    of the payments but that the phrases used in the <i>Act</i>, “pays remuneration” and “remuneration
    is paid”, speak only to the bare act of payment.  Counsel submits that Campbell
    J. erred in effectively substituting the word “remunerate” for the phrases
    actually used in the <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s
    arguments invite a syntaxian subtlety that is beyond my ability.  I see no
    essential difference between the verb “remunerate” and the phrases used in
    the <i>Act</i>.  All connote payment in exchange for something.  I do, however,
    agree with counsel for the Minister’s interpretation of those phrases.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    arriving at the correct meaning of the phrases “pays remuneration” and  “remuneration
    paid” as used in the <i>Act</i>, it is of fundamental importance that the
    phrases are used in the context of an ongoing employer/employee relationship.  As
    counsel for the Minister submitted, there can be payments made that are remunerative
    in nature that are not made in the context of an employee/employer relationship.  For
    example, a company may provide a payroll service whereby it serves as a conduit
    of funds from the employer to the employee.  While it may be that the payroll
    company remunerates the employee in a literal sense of the word, there is
    clearly no employer/employee relationship between the payroll company and
    the employee.  Consequently, the payment could not be caught by the <i>Act</i>.  Used
    in the context of an ongoing employer/employee relationship, I think the
    phrases “remuneration paid” and
    “pays remuneration” capture monies paid by an employer to an employee pursuant
    to the employer’s contractual obligations to the employee to pay for services
    provided by the employee.  For the reasons set out above, the payments made
    by IBM Canada into the expatriate’s bank account are payments made in the
    context of an ongoing employer/employee relationship and pursuant to IBM
    Canada’s contractual obligation to the expatriate.  The payments consist
    of wages and bonuses paid in return for services rendered by the expatriate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot agree that identity of the primary beneficiary of the services provided
    by the expatriate alters the remunerative character of the payments.  For
    example, an employer may direct its employee to provide services to a third
    party for a specified time perhaps in response to an emergency.  When the
    employer pays its employee for the period covered by that temporary assignment,
    the employer “pays remuneration” despite the fact the third party was the
    direct and primary beneficiary of the services provided during that work
    period.    </p>

    must also reject the submission that because the foreign affiliate bears
    the ultimate economic burden of the payment, it cannot be said that IBM Canada “pays
    remuneration” to the expatriate.  The nature of the payment does not turn
    on the ultimate source of the funds.  For example, there may be government
    programs which compensate employers for wages paid to employees in certain
    circumstances.  In those cases, the government bears the ultimate economic
    burden of the payment.  I would not think, however, that the existence of
    these programs would mean that the employer who pays the employee’s wages
    is not paying remuneration to the employee.  By imposing a tax based on “remuneration
    paid” in the context of an employer/employee relationship, the <i>Act</i> looks
    to the nature of the payment as between the employer and the employee and
    not to the source of the funds or to any arrangement which may exist between
    a third party and the employer for reimbursement.</p>

    foreign affiliate’s roles as the ultimate bearer of the economic burden and
    the beneficiary of the services provided, speak not to the nature of the
    payments made by IBM Canada but to whether IBM Canada remains in an employer/employee
    relationship with the expatriate.  Those two factors might suggest that the
    relationship does not continue.  However, for the reasons set out above,
    a comprehensive review of all of the relevant factors, including but not
    limited to those two, compels the conclusion that IBM Canada does remain
    in an employer/employee relationship with the expatriate.  </p>

    would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments of Campbell J., and substitute
    judgments dismissing the appeal from the Minister’s assessment and dismissing
    IBM Canada’s application for declaratory relief.  The Minister should have
    its costs of the proceedings before Campbell J. in the amounts fixed by him.  The
    Minister should have his costs of the appeal and cross-appeal in the amount
    of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

    is interesting to note that the expatriate is advised that while IBM Canada’s
    medical plan continues to apply to the expatriate, that plan requires the
    expatriate to look first to OHIP for payment of any medical expenses that
    may arise in the foreign jurisdiction.  IBM Canada’s medical and dental plans
    will not cover any medical services payable by OHIP.  The expatriate is advised
    to contact OHIP to determine what coverage he or she has while working abroad.</p>

    para. 48 of his reasons, Campbell J. appears to hold that both subsections
    require that the employee be “at a place of work” of the employer.  It does
    not seem that this observation played any role in his analysis.  I do not
    read subsection (b) that way.</p>
