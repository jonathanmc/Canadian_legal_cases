    appellant, Brak, was the main plaintiff in a jury trial for damages arising
    out of a motor vehicle accident. At the end of trial, after the jury began
    its deliberations, the defendant, Walsh, brought a motion that no action
    lay because the plaintiff did not meet the threshold required under s. 267.5(5)
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i> of suffering a “permanent serious impairment
    of an important physical, mental or psychological function”. The trial judge
    allowed the motion and the appellant appeals from that decision. The trial
    judge applied the following test: </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge provided a careful review of the medical evidence. He found that
    the appellant did sustain a low back injury as a result of the accident.
    He went on to find that she did not suffer a permanent impairment, the function
    impaired was an important one, and the impairment was not serious. The trial
    judge based his conclusion that there was no permanent impairment squarely
    on the evidence of Dr. Clifford, the appellant’s expert witness. He stated
    his belief that if the appellant followed Dr. Clifford’s advice on exercise,
    the pain she was experiencing would “clear up with time”. He also noted the
    evidence of the respondent’s expert, Dr. Heitzner that “her pain symptoms
    would diminish with time if she followed his recommendation on a regular
    exercise program.” In relation to whether the appellant’s injury was serious,
    the trial judge focused on the appellant’s ability to resume “almost all” of
    her domestic duties and the fact that she was able to hold gainful and steady
    employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not indicate what standard he applied to determine whether
    the low back pain experienced by the appellant was permanent, nor did he
    indicate what standard he applied to determine that the impairment was not
    serious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisprudence establishes that permanent means lasting indefinitely into
    the future as opposed to for a limited time with a definite end. See e.g. <i>Bos
    Estate v. James</i> (1995),<span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'> [1995]
    O.J. No. 598, </span>28 C.C.L.I. (2d) 166 (S.C.J.) Howden J.; <i>Altomonte
    v. Matthews</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 5756 (S.C.J.), McDermid J. The requirement
    of a permanent injury is also met when a limitation in function is unlikely
    to improve for the indefinite future: See: Roccamo J. in<i> Hartwick v. Simser,</i> [2004]
    O.J. No. 4315 at para. 87 and <i>Rizzo v Johnson</i> <span
class=canliicitation>(2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 633</span> Smith J. at para. 11 to
    the same effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent conceded at the appeal that there was no evidence that the appellant’s
    pain would “clear up”. The only evidence was that her pain would decrease
    with time. Neither expert offered a date by which she would be pain free,
    assuming she embarked on a reasonable exercise and weight loss program. In
    fact, both experts also recommended that she should avoid heavy lifting indefinitely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of whether an injury is serious was addressed by this court in <i>May
    v. Casola</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 2475 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Carthy J.A. said “In our view a person who can carry on daily activities,
    but is subject to permanent symptoms including, sleep disorder, severe neck
    pain, headaches, dizziness and nausea which, as found by the trial judge,
    had a significant effect on her enjoyment of life must be considered as constituting
    serious impairment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial judge’s standard was too high and
    we consider that an error in principle.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    here, as well, the trial judge’s focus was too narrow in determining whether
    the appellant’s injury was serious. The requirement that the impairment be “serious” may
    be satisfied even although plaintiffs, through determination, resume the
    activities of employment and the responsibilities of household but continue
    to experience pain. In such cases it must also be considered whether the
    continuing pain seriously affects their enjoyment of life, their ability
    to socialize with others, have intimate relations, enjoy their children,
    and engage in recreational pursuits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge did not indicate he considered anything other than that the
    appellant carried on with her full range of activities. This is not significant
    in itself as judges are presumed to know the law. However, the trial judge
    also failed to allude to evidence of the lay witnesses, which was important
    in assessing the appellant’s claim that continuing pain affected her overall
    enjoyment of life. Together these omissions undermine the conclusion he reached. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge therefore erred in the standard he applied both with respect
    to the permanency and seriousness of the appellant’s injuries. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the trial judge, and remit
    the matter to be reconsidered by a different judge. We cannot finally decide
    this matter because of the credibility issues involved, however, given the
    amounts involved, the parties may see fit to resolve the matter without a
    rehearing. We fix costs in favour of the appellant in the amount of $7,500.00
    plus disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
