    Di Guiseppe, a sixty-year old first offender, applies for release pending
    the determination of his appeal from conviction on a single count of fraud
    over $5,000.  Preliminary to an application of the governing standard, s.
    679(3) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, a brief reprise of the procedural
    history is of some value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of a police raid on several business premises, including the adult
    entertainment establishments, Fantasia and Bunnies, the applicant was charged
    with several <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> offences.  The applicant’s arrest
    took place in late March, 1999.  He was detained in custody for slightly
    more than two months until released by an order of a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    time passed, the criminal proceedings against the applicant atrophied.  In
    the end, the various counts were withdrawn or stayed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March, 2001, seven years ago, the applicant was in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida when notified he had been charged with several offences under the <i>Income
    Tax Act</i> and<i> Excise Tax Act</i>, as well as under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  These
    charges were contained in the information on which he was later tried, although
    the prosecutor withdrew all but the fraud count of which the applicant has
    now been convicted.  The applicant was released on the same day he surrendered
    to the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    time to time, as pre-trial motions and trial proceedings meandered along
    their somewhat arduous course, the applicant’s judicial interim release order
    was varied.  Prior to the finding of guilt and conviction, the order had
    settled in as a recognizance in the amount of $250,000 with a named surety
    and various residence and reporting conditions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecutor twice sought to revoke the applicant’s judicial interim release
    order.  The first attempt was upon the conviction being recorded, the next,
    when an application for post-conviction relief failed.  Neither application
    succeeded, although the release terms were varied on each occasion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 19, 2008, nearly seven months after the applicant had been convicted,
    he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years in a federal penitentiary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the applicant has been subject to a judicial interim release
    order for about seven years.  The record is barren of any claims of actual
    or apprehended breach of the release terms.  No attempt to interfere with
    witnesses.  No failures to attend.  Nothing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pre-trial applications, trial proceedings and applications for post-conviction
    relief were protracted, to put it charitably.  Pre-trial motions began in
    early 2003, the trial proper on November 14, 2005.  The applicant has been
    represented at different times by half a dozen different lawyers.  Briefly,
    he was unrepresented.  Appellate counsel estimate that the trial proceedings
    devoured about one hundred and thirty days or more of court time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, which involves an appeal from conviction and in time, no doubt,
    an application for leave to appeal sentence, the standard to be applied in
    determining whether to grant release pending determination of the appeal,
    is established by s. 679(3) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.  It falls
    to the applicant to establish: 1) that the appeal is not frivolous; 2) that
    the applicant will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the
    terms of any release order; and 3) that the applicant’s detention is not
    necessary in the public interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that the single issue in controversy concerns the requirement
    of s. 679(3)(a) that the applicant demonstrate that the appeal is not frivolous.  Said
    somewhat differently, the applicant must show an arguable ground of appeal.  It
    is inadequate to the task to simply recite the grounds of appeal asserted,
    rather the applicant must produce information about the circumstances that
    underlie the claims of error, thereby to satisfy the standard erected by
    s. 679(3)(a).  See, <i>R. v. Davison and DeRosie</i> (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d)
    422 at 423 per Brooke J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    discharge the onus imposed by s. 679(3)(a), the applicant relies upon particularized
    complaints about the form of the count upon which he was ultimately convicted
    and the basis of liability advanced on behalf of the prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pleading complaint was not advanced at trial, a proceeding that does not
    appear to otherwise have avoided the highly contagious pre-trial motion malaise.  At
    least one, if not both of the defects of which complaint is now made, the
    use of the term
    “the public” to describe the victim of the fraud, could be characterized
    as a defect apparent on the face of the information, hence subject to the
    requirement of s. 601(1) about the timing of the objection.  Appellate success
    may simply invoke the remedial amendment powers of s. 683(1)(g) if the applicant
    is correct in his submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second pleading complaint, equally not raised at trial, alleges a breach
    of the general but not unremitting single transaction rule of s. 581(3).  According
    to the applicant, the single transaction rule cannot comprehend myriad different,
    distinct transactions of allegedly criminal conduct relating to allegedly
    fraudulent non-payment of 1) separate and distinct tax liabilities of three
    corporate entities; 2) for the different tax liabilities, income tax and
    G.S.T., of each entity; 3) over a different time periods for each entity;
    4) on several different occasions within three different fiscal periods;
    5) through different <i>modus</i> <i>operandi</i>; and 6) carried out to
    different stages of execution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    argument based upon the same principle, violation of the single transaction
    rule, has achieved appellate success from time to time.  So too failure.  It
    cannot be stamped “frivolous” as a matter of course.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal ground of appeal to be advanced has to do with the theory of liability
    put forward by the prosecutor at trial, in particular, whether that theory
    can, as a matter of law, sustain a conviction for fraud in the absence of
    any submission of corporate income tax returns to the CCRA and its reliance
    on their contents as truthful in determining tax payable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not for the applicant to demonstrate certitude of appellate success, only
    that the particularized grounds of appeal are arguable.  That threshold,
    I am satisfied has been met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I am satisfied that the applicant should be released pending
    the determination of his appeal, on a recognizance with sureties and deposit,
    subject to strict conditions to ensure compliance and orderly and expeditious
    progress of preparation of the materials required for the appeal.</p>
