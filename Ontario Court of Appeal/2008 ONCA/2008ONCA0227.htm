    its original enactment in 1959, as <i>National Energy Board Act</i>,<i> </i>S.C.
    1959, c. 46, the <i>Act</i> has contained restrictions on land use on, along
    and under pipelines for the purpose of promoting public safety.  For example,
    s. 77(1) of the 1959 <i>Act</i> permitted a highway, private road, irrigation
    ditch or drain to be carried across a pipeline only with leave of the National
    Energy Board (the “Board”).  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the present time, the regulatory regime governing activities on or adjacent
    to lands on which a pipeline is located is found in s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and
    in the <i>National Energy Board</i> <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>,
    Parts I, S.O.R./88-528 and Part II, S.O.R./88-529 (“<i>Pipeline Crossing
    Regulations”)</i>.  Section 112 was enacted in its current form in 1990.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    112(1) prohibits anyone from constructing a facility (i.e. installations
    such as a structure, road, drainage or fence) across, on, along or under
    a pipeline or from excavating using power-operated equipment or explosives
    within thirty metres of the pipeline (“the control zone”) without leave of
    the Board.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1988, the Board passed the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>, which provide
    that leave of the Board is not required for certain activities on pipeline
    rights of way, including activities for which permission is obtained from
    the pipeline company.  Part II of the Regulations sets out the duties and
    responsibilities of pipeline companies when responding to requests for permission.</p>

    is not necessary in these reasons to go into detail about the interaction
    between s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>.  It
    is sufficient to point out that the appellants’ action is targeted at the
    imposition of increased restrictions on the use of their lands from the combined
    effect of both s. 112 and the Regulations, including the extension of land
    use restrictions to the control zone.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 31, 2000, the appellants instituted the action giving rise to this appeal
    under the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, C.6 (“<i>CPA</i>”).  In
    the action, they make claims on their own behalf and on behalf of other agricultural
    landowners in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    who have lands subject to the respondents’ federally-regulated pipeline easements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants claim compensation and/or damages for the restrictions on their
    ownership rights, the regulatory risks, and the loss of use and enjoyment
    of their lands, each resulting from the imposition of the control zone and
    the pipeline crossing restrictions found in s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and
    the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants allege that pipeline landowners suffer loss of income, increased
    costs and diminished property values from having to modify or restrict existing
    agricultural operations to comply with the new land use restrictions and
    requirements.  Likewise, they allege that future expansion or modification
    of agricultural or other operations and/or land use development will be impeded
    by the land use restrictions and the new notice and consent requirements.  Landowners
    who proceed with their normal farm practices in contravention of regulatory
    requirements incur the regulatory risk of criminal and civil liability.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is notable that the appellants’ claims are directed at the imposition of
    the statutory and regulatory regime found in s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and
    the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>.  The appellants do not complain
    that the pipeline companies have exercised the responsibilities assigned
    to them within the regime in a manner that diminishes the value of the landowners’ property
    or otherwise causes them loss.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants base their claims on three causes of action:  (1) a statutory
    cause of action for compensation found in s. 75 of the <i>Act</i>;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    in their easement agreements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after commencement of the action, CAPLA, acting on behalf of 157 individual
    landowners, including 488 and Kerr, served the Minister of Natural Resources
    with a notice of arbitration under s. 90(1) of the <i>Act</i>, seeking determination
    of their claims for compensation under s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> for the loss
    of interest in, and use and enjoyment of, the land sustained as a result
    of the provisions of s. 112 of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 10, 2001, the Minister denied CAPLA’s request for the appointment
    of an arbitration committee on the basis that the claims were not arbitable
    under the <i>Act</i>.  The Minister determined that the damages sought by
    CAPLA on behalf of its members were not a direct result of an activity of
    a pipeline company,<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> nor were the damages claimed the result of the
    exercise by Enbridge or TCPL of powers conferred upon them by the <i>Act</i>.  Thus,
    the Minister determined that the arbitration provisions under the <i>Act</i> did
    not apply to the claims for compensation asserted by CAPLA. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants did not challenge the Minister’s decision by applying for judicial
    review or otherwise.  Instead, they proceeded with the action that underlies
    this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents moved for summary judgment to dismiss the appellants’ claims
    on the basis that the evidence did not disclose a cause of action.  The appellants
    brought a motion seeking an order that their action satisfied the certification
    requirements of s. 5(1) of the <i>CPA</i>.</p>

    motion judge held that the action did not raise any genuine issues for trial.  She
    based her conclusion on four findings.  First, s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> does
    not create a statutory cause of action for damages.  It only entitles a landowner
    to seek compensation through the negotiation and arbitration scheme set out
    in the <i>Act</i>.  Second, the Minister’s decision refusing to refer the
    appellants’ claims to arbitration operated as an <i>estoppel</i> to the appellants’ claims
    under s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> in the within action.  Third, 488 and Kerr
    are not entitled to compensation under the compensation provisions in their
    easement agreements.  Fourth, any breaches by the respondents of covenants
    in the easement agreements were mandated by a change in the law and, therefore,
    the doctrine of frustration relieved the respondents of liability.</p>

    order to dispose of this appeal, I find it necessary to address three of
    the issues raised by the appellants:  </p>
  <p>(1)  does s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> create a statutory cause of action? </p>
  <p>(2) do the easement agreements require the respondents to compensate the
    appellants for damages arising from the imposition of land use restrictions
    pursuant to s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>? </p>
  <p>(3) do the land use restrictions referred to above breach any of the covenants

    my conclusion that the answer to the first issue is that s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> does
    not create a statutory cause of action, I do not find it necessary to determine
    whether the Minister’s decision refusing the appellants’ claims to arbitration
    operates as an <i>estoppel</i> to their claims under s. 75 in the within

  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <h2>Section 75 of the <i>Act</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no nominate tort of statutory breach in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Thus it is necessary to determine whether s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> expressly
    creates a civil cause of action. I agree with the motion judge that s. 75
    does not create a civil cause of action.  The plain meaning of the language
    used in the <i>Act</i>, along with other indicators of Parliament’s intent,
    show that the <i>Act </i>provides<i> </i>a complete code with respect to
    the determination of s. 75 compensation claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    there is no nominate tort of statutory breach, a statutory obligation – in
    this case the obligation to pay compensation for damages resulting from the
    exercise of a pipeline company’s statutory powers – cannot itself give rise
    to a civil cause of action unless the statute which establishes the obligation
    expressly provides for a right of action:  <i>Canada v. Saskatchewan Wheat
    Pool</i>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 205 at 225. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the question is whether s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> expressly creates
    a civil cause of action. Section 75 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A company shall,
    in the exercise of the powers granted by this Act or a Special Act, do as
    little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation <u>in the manner
    provided in this Act</u> and in a Special Act, to all persons interested,
    for all damage sustained by them by reason of the exercise of those powers.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    interpret s. 75, I rely on Driedger’s approach to statutory interpretation: “the
    words of an Act<i> </i>are to be read in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”. For a recent endorsement
    of this approach, see <i>A.Y.S.A. Amateur Youth Soccer Association v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    most obvious meaning of the language used in s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> is that
    the obligation of pipeline companies to compensate interested persons under
    the section is qualified by the phrase “in the manner provided in this Act”.  The
    plain meaning of that phrase, as the motion judge held, refers to the dispute
    resolution provisions in ss. 88 to 103.  Those sections set out a comprehensive
    scheme for the negotiation and arbitration of compensation claims made by
    landowners against pipeline companies pursuant to the <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Had
    Parliament intended to create a cause of action, it could have done so expressly.
    Indeed, s. 75 can be contrasted with ss. 58.25(3) and 87(3) of the <i>Act</i>,
    where Parliament expressly created civil causes of action for landowners
    in respect of the conduct of companies engaged in the acquisition of lands.  When
    Parliament uses specific language to confer a right in one section of the
    statute and uses different language in another provision of the same statute,
    it is an indication that Parliament did not intend to confer the same right
    in the second section.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants make five arguments in support of their submission that s.75 creates
    a civil cause of action.  First, they argue that the “permissive language” of
    s. 90(1) of the <i>Act</i> –
    which provides that a landowner or company “may” serve a notice of arbitration
    – is indicative of Parliament’s intent in that a s. 75 claim may be pursued
    either by way of arbitration or by civil action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument. Section 90(1) is one in a series of provisions
    that implement the <i>Act’s</i> negotiation and arbitration regime.  The
    use of the word “may” in this context indicates only that, following a breakdown
    of negotiations, arbitration is available should the parties wish to pursue
    it.  It would not make sense in this context to use the word “must” or
    “shall” because to do so would require parties who are unable to negotiate
    a settlement to arbitrate (as opposed to simply walking away from the dispute).  I
    do not accept that s. 90(1) can be read as indicating an intention by Parliament
    to create an alternative remedy through the courts for a s. 75 compensation
    claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the appellants’ argue that because some claims which may fall within s. 75
    are not arbitable under the <i>Act</i>, the void must be filled by a civil
    cause of action.  As part of this argument, the appellants submit that there
    must be compensation because the restrictions on the use of their lands in
    effect amount to an expropriation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    argument fails for two reasons.  The first is that Parliament created the
    right to compensation under s. 75; the right did not otherwise exist.  That
    being the case, it was open to Parliament to limit by statute the circumstances
    in which compensation is payable and the manner in which compensation may
    be pursued.  Parliament has specifically done so in s. 75.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second reason is that the appellants’ lands have not been expropriated.  Their
    claims are for the alleged harm resulting from the imposition by Parliament
    of restrictions on the use of their lands.  The enactment of s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and
    the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i> do not constitute a “taking” and
    are not an expropriation of land or a legal interest in land.  The restrictions
    are analogous to zoning regulations: they are regulatory rather than confiscatory
    and are directed at protecting the safety of the public, including the landowners
    on whose lands pipelines are located.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants third argument, which I also reject is based on the decision of
    Rothstein J.A. (as he then was) of the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>Balisky
    v. Canada (Minister of Natural Resources)</i>, [2003] 4 F.C. 30.  They contend
    that <i>Balisky</i> holds that if a potential compensation claim under s.
    75 is excluded from the arbitration process in the <i>Act</i>, then the claim
    may be pursued by civil cause of action.  I disagree.  The court in <i>Balisky</i> did
    not hold that compensation claims made pursuant to s. 75 of the <i>Act</i> may
    be pursued by way of civil action.  The court held only that the claim in
    that case came within s. 84 of the <i>Act</i> and was, therefore, subject
    to the arbitration process under the <i>Act</i>.  While the court did observe
    that some claims which are otherwise actionable at common law may not be
    included in the arbitration process under the <i>Act</i>, it did not say,
    as the appellants contend, that when a claim under s. 75 does not fall within
    the dispute resolution process in the <i>Act</i> it may be asserted by way
    of civil action.  Put another way, the court in <i>Balisky</i> did not hold
    that s. 75 creates a statutory cause of action for claims that do not fall
    within the dispute resolution process in the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    the appellants argue that they were entitled to arbitrate their claims under
    the <i>Act</i>, but that the process was “abortive” – referring to the Minister’s
    decision refusing arbitration.  This argument assumes that the Minister’s
    decision was wrong.  In that event, there was a means available to the appellants
    to pursue the arbitration process they contend was available to them; they
    could have pursued judicial review.  Their failure to do so does not create
    a civil cause of action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellants appear to argue as an alternative that their claims are enforceable
    under the arbitration provisions in the statutes that applied to pipelines
    prior to the inclusion of the dispute resolution scheme referred to above
    in the <i>Act</i> in 1983.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  One of the processes available under the earlier
    statutes was an application to a Superior Court judge.  The appellants argue
    that despite the fact that the provisions they seek to rely upon were replaced
    by Part V of the <i>Act</i> in 1983, they have a “vested right”
    to invoke those provisions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    short answer to this argument is that the appellants’ statement of claim
    does not seek relief under the predecessor provisions.  Indeed, the predecessor
    provisions provide for an arbitration process not a civil cause of action.  Even
    if the predecessor arbitration provisions continue to have some application,
    which I seriously doubt, the within proceeding is an action not an arbitration.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I agree with the motion judge that s. 75 does not create a statutory
    cause of action, even in circumstances in which a potential s. 75 claim may
    not be subject to arbitration under the dispute resolution scheme in the <i>Act</i>.    </p>
  <h2>Contractual Compensation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judge erred in holding that the damages
    alleged in the statement of claim were not compensable under the easement
    agreements.  I do not accept these arguments.  The compensation provisions
    in the two easement agreements are different and I will address them separately.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    compensation provision in favour of  488 requires Enbridge to pay compensation
    for the matters set out in clause Third.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>THIRD:  The Grantee
    [now Enbridge] will compensate the Grantor [now 488] <i>for damage done to
    any</i> buildings, crops, tile drains, fences, timber, culverts, bridges,
    lanes and livestock on the said land by reason of the exercise of the rights
    hereinbefore granted.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clause
    Third is not an unlimited obligation on Enbridge to pay compensation for
    all losses resulting from Enbridge operating a pipeline on 488’s lands.  Rather,
    the obligation is to pay for damage done to the enumerated list of physical
    items.  I am satisfied that the plain and ordinary meaning of the words “damage
    done to” in the context of this clause is referring to physical damage to
    the listed items.  In my view, the ordinary meaning of the language of clause
    Third does not extend to economic losses that may be incurred as a result
    of the presence of the pipeline on 488’s lands.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    when clause Third is read in the context of the whole easement agreement,
    it is apparent that the parties intended that the landowner would be compensated
    for losses, if any, arising from the presence of the pipeline on the grantor’s
    land through the payment that was made when the easement was granted.  Clause
    Third is a specific provision to cover instances of physical damage to the
    specifically enumerated items, nothing more.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its statement of claim, 488 does not allege any physical damages to the property
    items listed in clause Third.  In its evidence filed on the summary judgment
    motion, 488 refers to “crop and related productivity loss[es]” (i.e. economic
    losses) caused by the imposition of the land use restrictions.  I agree with
    the motion judge that these types of losses, if they occurred, do not fall
    within the compensation requirements in clause Third.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    damages alleged by 488 flow directly from the imposition of the land use
    restrictions in s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i>.  The
    easement agreement was negotiated and executed decades prior to the imposition
    of those restrictions.  It seems most improbable that clause Third was intended
    to require the pipeline company to compensate the landowner for losses that
    may result at some unknown time in the future from a then unknown government
    public safety regulatory regime.  Had that been the intention, the parties
    would have used much different language than that found in clause Third.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of its argument that clause Third applies, 488 again relies on the
    Federal Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Balisky</i>.  That reliance is misplaced.  <i>Balisky</i> did
    not involve a claim under an easement agreement.  It dealt only with a claim
    for compensation under the <i>Act</i>.  <i>Balisky</i> does not assist in
    interpreting the compensation provision in 488’s agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    on this point, 488 relies on s. 86 of the <i>Act</i> which sets out the minimum
    requirements for land acquisition agreements relating to pipelines.  Section
    86 was first enacted in 1983.  The language of s. 86 makes it clear that
    the minimum requirements for  land acquisition agreements apply to future
    acquisitions of land.  Section 86(2) prohibits a company from acquiring land
    for a pipeline unless the acquisition agreement contains the minimum requirements
    set out in the section.  The minimum requirements are not made applicable
    to existing agreements. There is nothing in s. 86 that indicates an intention
    that the section operate retroactively or an intention to modify existing
    contractual arrangements.  Section 86 does not help the appellant landowners.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    similar reasons, Kerr’s claim for compensation under the compensation provision
    of the agreement with TCPL fails.  In that agreement, the requirement to
    pay compensation is explicitly limited to “physical damages resulting from
    the exercise of any of the rights herein granted”.  Kerr does not allege
    physical damage to his property.  As with 488’s claim, the damages alleged
    flow from the government’s imposition of the land use restrictions.  For
    the reasons given above, I do not think that the compensation provision in
    Kerr’s easement agreement applies.</p>

    if covenants of this nature could be implied, there is no basis to conclude
    that the pipeline companies would have given such covenants with the reach
    now urged by the appellants.  There is nothing to suggest that the pipeline
    companies would have covenanted that the government would not impose public
    safety regulations with respect to pipelines at some time in the future.  Indeed,
    it is hard to imagine that they would have done so.</p>

    s. 112 of the <i>Act</i> and the <i>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</i> impose
    a duty on the respondents to reply to requests for permission to carry out
    certain activities in the control zone, this function has nothing to do with
    the conduct of the respondents’
    activities in these areas.  Moreover, the appellants do not allege that the
    respondents have abused or misapplied the permission authority in any way.</p>
