    appellant was convicted of selling crack cocaine to an undercover police
    officer.  The officer who made the purchase testified that the appellant
    was the person who sold him the cocaine on June 4, 2003 in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The undercover officer had been shown a photograph of the appellant
    earlier that day.  The undercover officer also testified to a chance encounter
    with the appellant the next day, June 5<sup>th</sup>.  The officer testified
    that the person he saw on June 5<sup>th</sup> was the same person who sold
    him the cocaine on June 4<sup>th</sup> and the same person whose photograph
    he was shown earlier that day.  The photograph was entered in evidence and
    was in fact a photograph of the appellant.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second police officer who was with the undercover officer on June 5<sup>th</sup> testified
    that he knew the appellant from prior encounters.  When he saw the appellant,
    he addressed him by name and the appellant responded.  The appellant was
    arrested a few months later, after the undercover operation was completed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant testified that he was in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto on June 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> and was not the person
    who sold the cocaine to the undercover officer.  The appellant’s mother testified
    that the appellant was living in her house in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto on June 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> and abiding by an 11:30

style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first ground of appeal relates to the trial judge’s instruction to the jury
    on identification.  Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to draw the important distinction between the reliability of identification
    evidence and the credibility of the witness giving the identification evidence.  Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge conflated the two and, in
    effect, invited the jury to infer reliability because of the police officer’s
    certainty with respect to his identification, particularly his identification
    on June 5<sup>th</sup>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Passages
    of the instruction suggest that the trial judge did fall into the error alleged
    by counsel for the appellant.  Read in isolation, these passages would indicate
    that the trial judge suggested to the jury that factors demonstrating the
    certainty of the officer’s testimony could provide a basis to infer that
    the evidence was, therefore, reliable.  Certainty cannot be equated with
    reliability in respect of identification evidence.  The certainty or uncertainty
    of an eyewitness’s identification is a factor that a jury may consider in
    assessing the ultimate reliability of that evidence.  Its importance as a
    factor for the jury will depend on the totality of the circumstances and
    the assessment of the particular jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    the passages that we think give legitimacy to counsel for the appellant’s
    submission, the totality of the instruction on identification evidence satisfies
    us that the jury would clearly understand that the officer’s certainty with
    respect to his identification was but one of many factors that the jury could
    consider in making its ultimate assessment as to the reliability of the evidence.  Both
    before and after the impugned passages, the trial judge expressly told the
    jury that the certainty of the identification could not be equated with its
    reliability and that witnesses who were certain in their identification evidence
    could well be shown to be wrong in that identification.  We see no error
    in the instruction when it is considered as a whole.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal arises out of the Crown’s cross-examination of the
    appellant.  The Crown cross-examined the appellant concerning the names of
    persons who, on the appellant’s version of events, could support his alibi.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that a jury can never be told that it can draw
    an adverse inference from the failure to call a witness who, according to
    the appellant, could support the appellant’s alibi.  We need not decide that
    question of law and should not be taken as accepting the appellant’s submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown was entitled to explore the appellant’s alibi evidence on cross-examination
    and test that evidence for details or the absence of details as a means of
    challenging the appellant’s credibility.  Details can include questions concerning
    the appellant’s whereabouts and the people the appellant was with at the
    relevant time.  Crown counsel pursued this form of cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge specifically told the jury that it could not draw any adverse
    inference from the failure to call certain witnesses.  This instruction effectively
    removes any need to consider the legal issue raised by counsel for the appellant.  There
    was no objection to the instruction and, in our view, none could legitimately
    be taken.  The cross-examination was not improper.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third ground of appeal also relates to the Crown’s cross-examination of the
    appellant.  This part of the cross-examination related to the appellant’s
    prior conviction for breach of probation.  The impugned cross-examination
    did no more than confirm the witness’s earlier evidence given in-chief that
    he had been convicted of breaching a probation order.  In our view, no prejudice
    could flow to the appellant from this cross-examination.  We also note that
    the trial judge gave a clear and accurate instruction as to the limited use
    that the jury could make of the appellant’s evidence concerning his prior
    criminal record.  This ground of appeal cannot succeed.</p>
