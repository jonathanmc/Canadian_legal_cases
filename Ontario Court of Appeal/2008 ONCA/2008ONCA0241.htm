    is an appeal from the decision of MacDougall J., which found that a notice
    of contestation that was delivered pursuant to ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.21 was a nullity.  The application judge consequently
    dismissed the appellant’s application, amongst other relief, for an order
    that the respondent be deemed to have abandoned any claims she has against
    the deceased’s estate and that any claim she has is forever barred.  </p>

    Omiciuolo died intestate on November 15, 2005.  At the time of his death
    he was separated from the appellant, Giovanna Omiciuolo.  Although Angelo
    and Giovanna had signed a separation agreement in 1998 in which the appellant
    released all her rights in his estate, including her right to act as administrator,
    the appellant applied for and received a Certificate of Appointment of Estate
    Trustee Without a Will in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    respondent, Luciana Pasco, alleges that she met the deceased in 1998, began
    a relationship with him in early 1999, and lived with him as his common law
    wife from 2000 until his death.  The appellant takes the position that the
    respondent was not the deceased’s spouse but his housekeeper and that she
    never resided in the deceased’s home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 7 2006, the appellant served the respondent with an application
    returnable in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket.  The appellant, amongst other relief, claimed vacant possession
    of the deceased’s
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto home or, alternatively, sought occupation rent from the respondent
    and the sale of the property.  At the same time, the appellant served the
    respondent with a notice of contestation, styled under the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket action, contesting the respondent’s claim on the basis that the
    respondent was neither a spouse nor a dependant of the deceased and that
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto property was not a matrimonial home.  The notice, issued pursuant
    to ss. 44 or 45 of the <i>Estates Act</i>, provided that if the respondent
    did not apply for an order allowing her “claim and determining its amount … within
    30 days … or within 3 months after that date if the judge on application
    so allows”, she would be deemed to have abandoned her claim and it would
    be forever barred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the return of the application in Newmarket on February 23, 2006, the parties
    reached what the appellant terms an “interim settlement” in which they agreed
    in writing to terms of a consent order, including an adjournment, document
    disclosure, a settlement meeting, a sale of the property with the proceeds
    of sale being held in trust, and a term that the parties reserved “all their
    rights with respect to remaining claims.”  In addition, the terms of adjournment
    provided for both parties to maintain various belongings of the deceased
    pending settlement or an order of the court.  The settlement did not explicitly
    address the notice of contestation, which – if it remained outstanding and
    operative – would have required the respondent to apply to the court by May
    7, 2006 at the latest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 24, 2006, the respondent delivered a notice of cross-application in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket.  In addition to other relief, and directions as to whether the
    appellant should be the estate trustee,<i> </i>the respondent sought a declaration
    of dependency and support under the <i>Succession Law Reform Act,</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. S.26 (<i>SLRA</i>).  She also sought declarations that she was the
    constructive trustee of the deceased’s property, that the deceased’s estate
    was unjustly enriched, and that she is entitled to compensation for her relationship
    with the deceased.  Despite the requirements of ss. 44(2) and 45(2) of the <i>Estates
    Act</i>, as well as of rule 39.01(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    the respondent apparently did not file a supporting affidavit until September
    25, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the meantime, the parties continued their efforts to negotiate a resolution
    of their dispute concluding with a final unsuccessful settlement meeting
    on August 3, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 14, 2006, the appellant delivered a notice of return of application
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket in which she purported to seek new relief - a declaration that
    the respondent
    “be deemed to have abandoned any claim she has against the estate and that
    any claim she has is forever barred”. </p>
  <h3><a name="P258_33363"></a><a name=s44s5></a>The application judge’s reasons</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    matters were heard on September 28, 2006 in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket.  The respondent brought a preliminary objection on the basis that
    the relief being sought by the appellant was a nullity because it was made
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket rather than in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge considered rule 75.1.02(1)(a)(i) of the <i>Rules</i>, which
    states that Rule 75 applies to all proceedings commenced in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Rule 75.08(1) requires a notice of contestation under ss. 44 or
    45 of the <i>Estates Act</i> to be in Form 75.13.  The application judge
    concluded that the proper court address specified on the form “should have
    been the address of the Toronto Estates Office, rather than the address for
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket courthouse.”  On this basis, he agreed with the respondent that
    the notice of contestation was a nullity and held that, because it was
    “incorrect”, “the time has not commenced under s. 44(2) of the <i>Estates
    Act</i>.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge also observed that, in any event, the consent adjournment
    effectively operated as a standstill order and that, if necessary, he would
    have extended the time for the respondent to file her claim under rule 3.02(2)
    of the <i>Rules</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Finally, the application judge observed that
    the appellant could seek relief in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and the respondent could seek an extension of the limitation period
    pursuant to s. 61(2) of the <i>SLRA</i> regarding her claim for support as
    a dependant. <a name="P7893_693745"></a><a name=s75p08s2></a></p>
  <h3>Statutory provisions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    44 and 45 of the <i>Estates Act</i> set out a code of summary procedure for
    determining claims or demands against the estate of a deceased person.  Section
    44 deals with liquidated claims, while section 45, which was added in 1946,
    deals with unliquidated claims.  These sections provide that where a personal
    representative has notice of a “claim or demand” against the estate of a
    deceased person, he or she may serve the claimant with a notice of contestation
    in writing.  In response, the claimant may, “<a name="P252_31411"></a><a name=s44s2></a>[w]ithin
    thirty days after the receipt of such notice of contestation or within three
    months thereafter … upon filing … a statement of their claim verified by
    affidavit and a copy of the notice of contestation, apply to the judge of
    the Superior Court of Justice for an order allowing the claim and determining
    the amount of it”.  If the claimant fails to make such an application, the
    claimant is “deemed to have abandoned the claim and it is forever barred.” </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the result reached by the application judge that the appellant’s
    application for a declaration to bar the respondent’s claim must be dismissed.  However,
    I do so for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <h3><i>(a)       Irregularity rather than a nullity</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with the application judge’s characterization of the notice of contestation
    as a nullity because it was issued in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket rather than in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant applied to be the administrator in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, where the deceased had a “fixed place of abode” at death, because
    she was required to do so under section 7 of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  However,
    she issued the notice of contestation in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket.  It is reasonable to infer that she likely did so to avoid the
    rule 75.1.02 mandatory mediation requirement for estates matters in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the appellant was entitled to choose
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Newmarket as her place of commencement under rules 38.03(1) and 13.1.01(1),
    the respondent unquestionably attorned to the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket jurisdiction.  She did so when she issued a notice of appearance
    in that court, when she attended on the return of the appellant’s initial
    application and agreed to the interim settlement, and when she filed her
    own cross-application with the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Newmarket court.  Moreover, even if the proceedings should have been commenced
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and not
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Newmarket, the failure to do so renders them only an irregularity that could
    have been remedied by a transfer of the proceedings from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  See rules 2.01 and 2.02 as well as rule 13.1.02 of the <i>Rules</i>.  Accordingly,
    I cannot agree with the application judge that the appellant’s proceedings
    were a nullity.</p>
  <h3><i>(b)       Claim or demand  </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the notice of contestation could not be dismissed as a nullity, the question
    remains whether the respondent’s claims are deemed to have been abandoned.  This
    depends on the interpretation to be given to ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates
    Act</i>, which applies to a “claim or demand” made against an estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interpretation of “claim or demand” must be determined in the context of
    the legislation and consistent with its purpose.  See Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan
    and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4th ed. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 2002) at 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of the provisions, as described in Rodney Hull &amp; Ian M. Hull, <i>MacDonnell,
    Sheard, and Hull on Probate Practice</i>, 4th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1996),
    at p. 329, is “to expedite the winding up of the estates of deceased persons
    by affording to personal representatives a means of determining within a
    reasonable time the legal validity of claims which they think should be contested.”  Noting
    that the procedure is seldom used, the authors conclude that the claims or
    demands captured by the provisions are those brought by creditors.  At p.
    331, they also list other types of claims that have been found to fall outside
    the parameters of the provisions, such as legacies, mortgage enforcement
    claims, a <i>donatio mortis causa</i>, and dower claims: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The “claim or demand” referred to in subs. (1)
    is clearly <u>a claim or demand against an estate by a creditor for payment
    of a money demand</u>.  Where a claimant sought to establish a <i>donatio
    mortis causa</i> in respect of moneys deposited in a savings bank to the
    credit of the estate, it was held this did not come within the section because
    the Judge was not asked to establish a debt against the estate by a creditor,
    but something in the nature of a decree or declaration that would make the
    administration a trustee of the moneys for the donee.<a

    nature of ss. 44 and 45 claims as third party claims is also discussed in
    Brian A. Schnurr, <i>Estate Litigation</i>, 2nd ed., looseleaf (Toronto:
    Carswell, 1994), at
    §8.3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The sections clearly anticipate claims by third
    parties as opposed to beneficiaries or legatees of the estate.  It would
    appear that the type of claims which the sections address are money claims – the
    sections do not relate to any claims arising from tort.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>See also Anne E.P. Armstrong, <i>Estate
      Administration: A Solicitor’s Reference Manual,</i> looseleaf (Toronto:
      Carswell, 1984) at §3-44.  To the same effect, Carmen S. Theriault, <i>Widdifield
      on Executors and Trustees</i>, 6th ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 2002)
      at §3.4.4 says that a claim or demand is “clearly a claim or demand against
      an estate by a creditor for payment of a money demand.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language “claim or demand” was considered in <i>Re Graham </i>(1911), 25
    O.L.R. 5 (H.C.J.), which was decided under the predecessor provision of s.
    69(1) of the <i>Surrogate Courts Act</i>, 10 Edw. VII.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ch.</st1:country-region>
    31.  In that case, Teetzel J., sitting on appeal from the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Surrogate Court, held that “claim or demand”, when read in light of the section
    as a whole, referred to a claim or demand against the estate by a “creditor” for
    payment of a money demand.  On this basis, a claim of a <i>donatio mortis
    causa </i>was held to be neither a claim nor a demand.  The court observed
    that such a claim was in the nature of a declaration that the monies ceased
    being part of the estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation was adopted in <i>London &amp; Western Trust Co. et al. v.
    Sale</i>, [1936] O.R. 244 (S.C.), a case concerning a claim to enforce a
    mortgage.  In that case, Hogg J. concluded that a claim or demand “must be
    held to be claims or demands for the payment of money, and not claims or
    demands of any other nature or character.”  Accordingly, like a claim for
    declaratory relief, a claim for a judicial sale or for foreclosure and possession
    of land in the mortgage context was held not to fit within the meaning of
    a claim for money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    section 45 was added to predecessor legislation in 1946 to address unliquidated
    claims, I do not see this addition as changing the intent of the legislature.  While
    section 45 sets out a modified summary procedure, there is nothing in that
    section to suggest that the language “claim or demand” should be given a
    different interpretation when it is unliquidated than when it is liquidated.  Moreover,
    the intent to restrict the summary procedure to claims of creditors remained
    in section 44, with s. 44(6) requiring a judge to “direct the creditor to
    bring an action for the recovery or establishment of the creditor’s claim”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in my view, the respondent’s claims for declaratory relief, which is the
    nature of her claim under the <i>SLRA</i> as well as her other claims arising
    from her relationship as a spouse, do not fall within the meaning of a “claim
    or demand” under ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find support for this conclusion in s. 61(2) of the <i>SLRA</i>, which provides
    for a six month limitation period that can be extended in proper circumstances.  This
    provides a relatively brief limitation period in recognition of the benefits
    of an expeditious administration of an estate, while also providing a reasonable
    time frame after the death of a deceased for his or her dependant to advance
    a claim.  In my view, this limitation period, which appropriately permits
    an extension of time in proper circumstances, governs a dependant’s claim
    for relief, and not the limitation period set out under ss. 44(2) and 45(2)
    of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  Moreover, I observe that the <i>Estates Act</i> does
    not permit a judge to grant an extension of time for creditors’ claims, while
    the <i>SLRA</i> allows for an extension of time for a dependant claiming
    relief.  In these circumstances, in my view the limitation provisions for
    dependants under the <i>SLRA</i> do not conflict with the provisions of the <i>Estates
    Act</i> dealing with creditors’ claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also find two other decisions helpful.  In <i>Re</i> <i>Lawrence Estate</i>,
    [1950] O.W.N. 571 (H.C.J.), Kelly J., sitting on appeal from the Surrogate
    Court, rejected the argument that the amendment adding unliquidated claims
    expanded the scope of what are presently ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates
    Act</i> to include any claim made against an estate.  In his opinion, those
    provisions relate only to creditors’ claims.  In <i>Re Brill, </i>[1967]
    2 O.R. 586, Clunis Surr. Court J. explained why he rejected the argument
    that a claimant under the then <i>Dependants Relief Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. 104, fit within the definition of a creditor:  “I conceive that an applicant
    under the <i>Dependants' Relief Act</i> is not a creditor of the estate.  He
    is a claimant under a statute passed to empower the Court to alter the terms
    of a deceased's will so as to ensure adequate provision for the maintenance
    of such an applicant.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the interpretation I have reached is consistent with the findings
    of the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s <i>Report on Administration of Estates
    of Deceased Persons </i>(Toronto: Ontario Law Reform Commission, 1991).  In
    that report, the OLRC acknowledged the interpretation in the case law of
    the language “claim or demand” as referencing creditors’ claims and not third
    party claims.  The Report concluded at p. 196 that “there appears to be no
    reason to restrict the proposed notification and contestation procedures
    to ‘claims and demands’, as currently interpreted.”  The OLRC was of the
    opinion, in view of the purpose of the regime, that “claims and demands” should
    include all third party claims whether arising in contract, tort, property
    interest or any other cause.  However, the OLRC’s recommendations have not
    been adopted by the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario legislature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded to a contrary view by the two recent authorities relied
    upon by the appellant.  In <i>Ethier v. Raspberry</i>, [1997] 16 E.T.R. (2d)
    197 (Ont. Gen. Div.), Huneault J. held a claim based on <i>quantum meruit</i>,
    amongst other grounds, to be barred because the plaintiff failed to comply
    with the time limitations of ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  He
    based his conclusion on the New Brunswick Queen’s Bench decision in <i>Dunn
    v. McNeil Estate</i> (1995), 8 E.T.R. (2d) 313 (N.B.Q.B.).  However, it appears
    that neither court was provided with the long-standing line of authorities
    regarding the nature of the
    “claim[s] and demand[s]” encompassed under the summary procedure for notification
    and contestation and neither decision undertakes an analysis of the applicable
    provisions.  In those circumstances, I do not find the conclusions reached
    in these cases to be helpful.  </p>
  <h3><i>(c)       Notice of claim lapsed</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, I agree with the motion judge that the consent order adjourning
    the proceedings operated at a minimum as a standstill agreement with respect
    to the notice of contestation.  Moreover, in my view, the notice of contestation
    lapsed by the time the respondent filed her notice of cross-application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the parties reached their interim settlement, they clearly intended to embark
    on a course of document disclosure and settlement discussions.  It was implicit
    in the wording of the adjournment terms that the running of time under the
    notice of contestation was suspended.  It would be absurd to suggest that
    the respondent agreed to an adjournment to negotiate claims that would be
    barred if she took no court action within 30 days, or at most three months.  Further,
    the continuation of the suspension is evident from the parties’ conduct over
    the ensuing five or six months as they continued their negotiations.  At
    no time during this period did the appellant attempt to revive the notice
    of contestation, deliver a new notice of contestation, or return the matter
    to court.  It was not until August 14, 2006, six months after the notice
    of contestation was first issued, and almost three months after the respondent
    delivered her notice of cross-application, that the appellant purported to
    seek a declaration that the respondent had abandoned her claim.  In doing
    so, the appellant did not take the position that she was reviving the February
    7 notice of contestation, but instead argued that it had already expired.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it was patently obvious throughout that the respondent had not abandoned
    her claim.  Not only had she engaged in months of negotiations with the appellant,
    but she had issued a claim against the estate seeking relief, including relief
    under the <i>SLRA</i>.  In my view, at that time, whether by acquiescence,
    waiver or estoppel, the notice of contestation had lapsed.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I conclude, first, that the issuance of the notice of contestation
    in

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newmarket was an irregularity and not a nullity.  Second, the respondent’s
    claims do not fall within the meaning of a
    “claim or demand” under ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  In any
    event, the consent order operated to suspend the notice of contestation,
    which thereafter lapsed.  Accordingly, the respondent’s claims are not statute
    barred pursuant to ss. 44(2) and 45(2) of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  I would
    dismiss the appeal and return the outstanding matters, including any relief
    requested to extend the time under s. 61(2) of the <i>SLRA,</i> to the court
