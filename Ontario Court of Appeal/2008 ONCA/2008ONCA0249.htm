  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>A.        OVERVIEW</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Done Right Roofing, a roofing repair company,
    is insured by the respondent, CUMIS General Insurance Company, under a
    commercial general liability policy.  The
    issue on the appeal is whether CUMIS has a duty to defend Done Right in an
    action brought by a motorcyclist for damages for personal injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motorcyclist, Ewen MacMillan, was struck by a
    ladder when it flew off a Done Right truck being driven along a country road in
    South Glengarry,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  MacMillan claims that the ladder knocked him
    off his motorcycle and seriously injured him.  He has sued Done Right, alleging that in cleaning up a work site, one of
    Done Right’s employees negligently loaded and stored the ladder on the truck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right asked CUMIS to defend the MacMillan action
    on its behalf.  CUMIS refused, contending
    that MacMillan suffered an automobile-related injury and that CUMIS’s policy
    with Done Right excludes coverage for automobile-related risks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CUMIS brought an application for a declaration that it
    has no duty to defend MacMillan’s action.  The application judge, D. Brown J., granted the declaration.  In doing so, he relied principally on an
    exclusion from coverage in the “G.L. Plus” rider, which amended the original
    policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right makes three submissions on its appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        CUMIS cannot rely on the G.L. Plus rider
    to exclude coverage otherwise available to its insured because to do so would
    defeat Done Right’s reasonable expectations;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       The CUMIS commercial general liability
    policy does not exclude coverage for bodily injuries arising from the “loading
    or unloading” of an automobile; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     MacMillan’s statement of Claim alleges
    non-automobile-related negligence, which imposes a duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to any of these three
    submissions.  I substantially agree with
    the reasons of the application judge.  I
    add my own brief reasons, partly to address Done Right’s first submission,
    which was not made to the application judge.</p>
  <h3>B.        MacMILLAN’S CLAIMS IN THE
    UNDERLYING ACTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the application judge correctly stated at para. 8 of
    his reasons, “[t]he specific pleadings in an action serve as the benchmark
    against which a court must assess an insurer’s obligation to defend.”  The basic principle is that “an insurer has a
    duty to defend where on the facts as pleaded there is a possibility that one or
    more of the claims made against the insured are covered by the policy.”  See <i>Unger
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Unger</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 257 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at para. 9.  I will therefore briefly
    summarize MacMillan’s allegations of negligence against Done Right (and its
    employees) in his statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statement of claim makes a number of allegations of
    negligent driving.  These are not in
    issue on this appeal.  What are in issue
    are the allegations of negligence concerning the cleanup of the worksite and
    the loading and storage of the ladder on the truck.  Stripped to its essentials, the statement of
    claim alleges that Done Right:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to properly store the ladder “in the
    course of cleaning up the worksite and prior to leaving the worksite”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to implement a system for instructing its
    employees on how to clean up a worksite, on how to properly load, store and
    secure work equipment onto trucks, and on how to properly inspect a truck
    before using it;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to properly secure and store the ladder
    on the truck and failed to keep the ladder “under proper care and control”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to properly supervise its employees
    during the “loading, storing and securing of cargo on their vehicles”; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed to provide the “necessary tools,
    equipment and vehicles which would permit the safe loading, storage and
    transportation of work equipment and cargo.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Might one or more of these claims against Done Right be
    covered by the policy, so as to trigger CUMIS’s duty to defend?  The answer turns on the wording of the
    policy.</p>
  <h3>C.        THE RELEVANT TERMS OF THE CUMIS COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY
    POLICY</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy contains both coverage provisions and
    exclusions from coverage.  Two coverage
    provisions are relevant.  First, under
    the policy, CUMIS agrees to pay on behalf of its insured Done Right “all sums
    which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages
    because of bodily injury.”  Second, “as respects
    insurance afforded by this policy,” CUMIS agrees to defend at its cost any
    civil action for bodily injury brought against Done Right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the scope of “insurance afforded by this
    policy,” and thus the duty to defend, turns on the scope of the exclusions from
    coverage.  The original policy lists a
    number of exclusions, of which only one, the automobile exclusion, exclusion
    (b), is in question on this appeal.  Exclusion (b) reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This insurance does not apply to …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>bodily injury or property damage arising out of the
    ownership, maintenance, use or operation by or on behalf of the Insured of any
    automobile.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The definition of automobile under
    the policy includes the truck driven by Done Right’s employee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The G.L. Plus rider amended the automobile exclusion in
    the original policy by deleting exclusion (b) and replacing it with a two-pronged
    exclusion – O(b)(1) and O(b)(2).  The relevant
    parts of the replacement exclusion “O. Broad Form Automobile” read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)(1)  bodily injury or property damage arising out
    or the ownership, use or operation by or on behalf of any Insured of:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        any
    automobile …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)(2)  bodily injury or property damage with respect
    to which any motor vehicle liability policy:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        is
    in effect, or </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       would
    be in effect but for its termination upon exhaustion of its limits of
    liability, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     is
    required by law to be in effect</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>O(b)(1) in substance duplicates
    exclusion (b) in the original policy.  O(b)(2), however, was a new exclusion.  In granting the declaration that CUMIS had no duty to defend, the
    application judge relied on O(b)(2).</p>
  <h3>D.        ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>1.         Can CUMIS rely on the G.L. Plus rider to exclude coverage
    otherwise available to its insured?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the application judge relied on
    exclusion O(b)(2) in the G.L. Plus rider to hold that CUMIS does not have a
    duty to defend the MacMillan action.  O(b)(2) excludes coverage for bodily injury “with respect to which any
    motor vehicle liability policy (i) is in effect, or … (iii) is required by law
    to be in effect.”  Section 239 of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s<i> Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.I-8,
    required that Done Right insure its trucks “against liability … arising from
    the ownership or directly or indirectly from the use or operation of any such
    automobile.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the application judge pointed out, case law under s.
    239 or its equivalent has established that the loading and storage of the
    ladder on the truck – which is at the heart of the claim in the underlying
    action – comes within the scope of the “use or operation” of a truck because it
    is one of the “ordinary and well-known activities” to which trucks are
    put.  See, e.g., <i>Stevenson v. Reliance Petroleum.</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 936.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge therefore concluded at para. 29
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In light of these
    authorities, I conclude that the loading and storing of a ladder onto the truck
    constitute the direct or indirect use or operation of an automobile under the
    terms of a motor vehicle liability policy that “is in effect, or…is required by
    law to be in effect” for the Respondent’s truck.  As a result, Exclusion O(b)(2) of the Policy
    excludes from coverage the negligent acts of loading and storing the ladder
    onto the truck which lie at the heart of the MacMillan Action.  CUMIS therefore does not owe the Respondent a
    duty to defend the MacMillan Action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Done Right candidly conceded that the
    application judge’s conclusion is correct.  If, then, CUMIS is entitled to rely on the G.L. Plus rider, apart from
    its third submission (allegations of non-automobile-related negligence) Done
    Right cannot succeed on its appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right, however, argues that the G.L. Plus rider does
    not apply because CUMIS’s reliance on it would defeat the reasonable
    expectations of its insured.  This
    argument was not put to the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In substance, the argument is that the G.L. Plus rider claimed
    to provide extended liability coverage, but in fact did the opposite: it
    reduced the insurance coverage provided in the original policy.  A prime example of the reduction in coverage
    is the automobile exclusion, which was broadened to include the very exclusion
    the application judge relied on, O(b)(2).  According to Done Right, reducing coverage when the rider professes to
    extend coverage, does not accord with an insured’s reasonable expectations.  In essence, Done Right says that it was
    misled, and the G.L Plus rider itself is misleading.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument takes on significance, Done Right further
    contends, because if CUMIS cannot rely on the exclusions in the G.L. Plus rider
    it must rely on exclusion (b) in the original policy.   And Done Right submits that although the
    loading and storage of the ladder on the truck falls within the scope of the
    “use or operation” of an automobile in the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, it does not fall within the scope of the “use or operation” of an
    automobile in exclusion (b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept Done Right’s argument that the
    application of the rider would defeat its reasonable expectations.  In addition, as I discuss in the next section
    of these reasons, in my view, the loading and storage of the ladder on the
    truck comes within the scope of exclusion (b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right led no evidence of its actual expectations,
    on how the G.L. Plus rider was marketed, or on what representations CUMIS made
    to it.  Without any evidence on these
    matters Done Right’s argument that it was misled must fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Canadian courts have typically used the
    reasonable expectations principle to resolve ambiguities in a policy.  See <i>Chilton
    v. Co-Operators General Insurance Co.</i> (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); Craig Brown &amp; Julio Menezes, <i>Insurance Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto:
    Carswell, 2002) at 8-13.  The O(b)(2)
    exclusion is unambiguous.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And even if the reasonable expectations principle had a
    broader scope it would not apply in this case because the G.L. Plus rider is
    not misleading.  The rider does not
    narrow coverage under the guise of extending it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The G.L. Plus rider contains provisions both extending
    coverage and broadening exclusions.  A
    reasonable insured should not expect one without the other.  The rider extends coverage, for example, by
    defining bodily injury to include injury arising out of false arrest, malicious
    prosecution, libel, slander, defamation and invasion of privacy, as well as by
    specifically providing for advertising liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A rider extending coverage may also be reasonably expected
    to modify exclusions.  The rider states
    repeatedly in bold letters, “Amended Exclusion”.  The automobile exclusion itself has the
    effect of both narrowing and extending coverage.  It narrows coverage by adding O(b)(2) to the
    exclusion in the original policy.  But it
    also extends coverage by restricting the definition of automobile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the original policy, automobile is defined to mean
    (subject to certain exception) any self-propelled land motor vehicle other than
    a land motor vehicle used solely on the premises of the insured.  In the G.L. Plus rider, automobile is defined
    more restrictively to mean “any self-propelled land motor vehicle…which is
    principally designed for the transportation of persons or property on public
    roads.”  So arguably, under the G.L. Plus
    rider CUMIS may be required to indemnify Done Right for an accident caused by
    one of its vehicles that, though not used solely on its premises, was nonetheless
    not principally designed for the transportation of people or property on public
    roads.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with CUMIS that it would not be reasonable for
    Done Right to accept the benefits of the extension of coverage without also
    accepting the corresponding restrictions, restrictions that are set out in
    clear, plain language in the rider.  I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2.         Does the original policy
    exclude coverage for bodily injuries arising from the loading and unloading of
    an automobile?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the G.L. Plus rider does not apply and CUMIS must
    rely on exclusion (b) in the original policy, in my view, injuries arising from
    the loading or unloading of an automobile come within the scope of “use or
    operation” of an automobile in that exclusion.  Done Right’s submission that coverage is not excluded rests on comparing
    the wording of the automobile exclusion (b) with the wording of the watercraft
    and aircraft exclusions, both of which expressly exclude bodily injury arising
    out of the “loading or unloading” of any watercraft or aircraft.  As exclusion (b) does not expressly exclude the
    loading or unloading of an automobile, Done Right contends that MacMillan’s
    injuries resulting from the negligent loading and storage of the ladder on the
    truck are covered by the policy.  This
    contention relies on the implied exclusion maxim<i>, expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>: to express one thing is to
    exclude another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found Done Right’s submission “an
    attractive one”.  Relying on American
    authority, he rejected CUMIS’s argument that the implied exclusion maxim cannot
    apply to exclusion clauses in an insurance policy.  Instead he acknowledged “some merit” in Done
    Right’s contention that the interpretation of one exclusion clause can take account
    of similar language used in another exclusion clause.  However, he did not resolve Done Right’s
    submission because he concluded that exclusion O(b)(2) in the G.L. Plus rider
    precluded coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the implied exclusion maxim does not assist
    Done Right because it does not apply to the automobile exclusion (b) in the
    original policy (or to the similarly worded exclusion O(b)(1) in the G.L. Plus
    rider).  It does not do so because the
    context for the automobile exclusion differs from the context for the
    watercraft and aircraft exclusions.  The
    intent of the automobile exclusion is that automobile-related risks are to be
    insured against under an automobile insurance policy, which is required by the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  Well-established automobile insurance law
    recognizes that the use or operation of an automobile includes the loading or
    unloading of that automobile.  Express
    reference in the automobile exclusion to loading or unloading is therefore unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast, watercraft and aircraft are not subject to
    a mandatory insurance regime.  Moreover,
    there is no acknowledged case law establishing that the use or operation of a
    boat or an airplane includes the loading and unloading of it.  Thus, the watercraft and aircraft exclusions
    contain the words that the automobile exclusion does not to capture this
    broader liability.  Accordingly, I
    conclude that the automobile exclusion (b) in the original policy and exclusion
    O(b)(1) in the G.L. Plus rider exclude coverage for bodily injuries arising
    from the negligent loading and storage of the ladder on Done Right’s
    truck.  As CUMIS’s policy does not impose
    a duty to defend for automobile-related negligence, the remaining question is
    whether the MacMillan’s statement of claim alleges non-automobile-related negligence,
    which does not fall under the exclusions and therefore triggers CUMIS’s duty to
    defend.</p>
  <h3>3.         Does MacMillan’s
    statement of claim allege non-automobile related negligence, which imposes a
    duty to defend?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right submits that MacMillan’s claim alleges a
    concurrent cause of action in negligence unrelated to the use and operation of
    an automobile, thus imposing on CUMIS a duty to defend the underlying
    action.  According to Done Right,
    MacMillan’s allegations of non-automobile-related negligence include failing to
    properly store the ladder in the course of cleaning up the worksite, failing to
    properly instruct its employees on how to cleanup a worksite, and failing to
    supervise its employees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Done Right’s submission relies on the judgment of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Derksen v.
    539938 Ontario Ltd.</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 398.  <i>Derksen</i> dealt with whether a
    comprehensive general liability insurance policy provided coverage for damages
    caused when a steel base plate flew off a tow bar attached to the back of a
    supply truck, killing one child and severely injuring three others.  During a workplace clean up, an employee had
    left the base plate on the tow bar instead of storing it in the truck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exclusion clause in issue in <i>Dersken</i> was identical to exclusions O(b)(1) and (2) in the CUMIS
    G.L. Plus rider.  In <i>Derksen</i> the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs had alleged
    two concurrent causes of action: negligent cleanup of the work site, which was
    not part of the loading of the automobile, and was therefore non-automobile-related
    negligence covered by the comprehensive general liability policy; and
    negligence in the operation of the truck, which was automobile-related
    negligence, and therefore covered by the automobile policy.  Similarly, here, Done Right argues, the
    allegation of non-automobile-related negligence requires CUMIS to defend
    MacMillan’s action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not agree with Done Right’s
    submission.  He distinguished <i>Derksen</i> on the basis that all
    MacMillan’s allegations of negligence at the work site relate to loading the
    ladder on the truck and failing to secure it.  He said at para. 15: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On a reasonable reading of the Statement of Claim
    in the MacMillan Action I cannot reach a similar conclusion.  In my view the “the substance and true
    nature” of the claim is that the Respondent’s employee failed to load and properly
    secure the ladder to the company’s vehicle (Statement of Claim, paragraph
    11).  Unlike <i>Derksen</i> this is not a “failure to load” case.  The Statement of Claim clearly suggests that
    the employee intended to clean up the work site by loading the ladder onto the
    truck and that he did so, but failed to secure the ladder properly to the
    truck.  Those portions of the Statement
    of Claim that plead facts relating to the clean up of the work site (Statement
    of Claim, paras. 10, 24(e), 24(g) and 24(n)) all link the act of cleaning up
    inextricably to the act of loading the ladder onto the truck and failing to
    secure it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge, therefore, concluded that the
    underlying action “does not plead a concurrent cause of action regarding the
    negligent clean-up of the work site.”  The ‘substance and true nature’ of the claim involves the allegation of
    negligently loading and storing of the ladder on the truck”.  I agree with the application judge’s analysis
    of the issue and with his conclusion.  I
    therefore would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>E.        CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss Done Right’s appeal and uphold the
    declaration granted by the application judge that CUMIS has no duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CUMIS is entitled to rely on the automobile exclusion
    in its G.L. Plus rider.  However, even if
    were it not entitled to rely on the rider, the automobile exclusion in the
    original policy precludes a duty to defend.  Finally, the statement of claim in the underlying action does not allege
    non-automobile-related negligence, which would trigger a duty to defend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CUMIS is entitled to its costs of the appeal in the
