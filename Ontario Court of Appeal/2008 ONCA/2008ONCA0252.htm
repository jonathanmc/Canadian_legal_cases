  <h2>1.         INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Paul Douglas Gallagher, pleaded
    guilty to six counts on a twelve-count indictment concerning a series of
    fraud-related offences.  He was convicted
    of attempting to defraud the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce of over $5,000,
    two counts of defrauding the Toronto-Dominion Bank of over $5,000, fraudulent
    imper-sonation of his cousin with intent to gain advantage for himself,
    defrauding a local telephone company of a value not exceeding $5,000, and
    uttering a forged document.  The
    remaining charges were withdrawn by the Crown.  On April 17, 2007, he was sentenced to three years incarceration, after
    credit for twelve months pre-sentence custody on a two-for-one basis.  He was also ordered to make restitution in
    the amount of $19,542.42.  He appeals his
    sentence, including the restitution order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the sentencing judge
    erred: (i) by holding that deterrence and separation from society were the only
    applicable sentencing principles in this case; (ii) by failing to properly
    consider the evidence of the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation; (iii) by
    overemphasizing the appellant’s criminal record; (iv) by relying on statements
    made by the appellant’s probation officer in a pre-sentence report concerning
    the appellant’s rehabilitation potential; (v) by imposing a sentence that
    offended the “jump” principle; and (vi) by requiring restitution in addition to
    the term of imprisonment imposed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the following reasons, save for the
    appellant’s challenge to the restitution order, we would not give effect to
    these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        DISCUSSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see no error in the trial judge’s assessment
    or application of the governing sentencing principles in this case, or in his
    consideration of the evidence of the appellant’s criminal record and
    rehabilitation prospects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The predicate offences were committed between
    March 6 and April 7, 2006, while the appellant was on parole for similar
    offences.  The appellant assumed the
    identity of his cousin and used various forms of forged identification in his
    cousin’s name to obtain or to attempt to obtain loans from the two banks, to
    purchase a cell phone, and to enter into an agreement for cellular service with
    a local telephone company based on identification particulars pertaining to his
    cousin.  In total, the appellant
    defrauded these organizations of $82,135.53.  The sum of $62,593.11 was recovered, leaving an outstanding amount of
    $19,542.42.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant has a horrendous criminal record
    for fraud and other property-related offences.  Since 1981, when he was seventeen years old, the appellant has amassed
    an appalling total of 57 prior convictions, 46 of which involved offences
    similar to the predicate offences, including convictions for fraud, forgery,
    possession of stolen property and personation with intent.  For these crimes, the appellant has served
    custodial sentences ranging from one day to two years and three months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, the appellant has nine prior
    convictions for failure to attend court, attempted obstruction of justice and
    breaches of both probation orders and a conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge expressly adverted to the
    sentencing principles set out under s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In
    particular, in respect of the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation, the
    sentencing judge noted that for almost twenty-five years, the appellant has
    engaged in a persistent course of criminal conduct involving, for the most
    part, offences the same as or similar to the predicate offences, that is,
    “offences dealing in some way with depriving others of their property”.  He also observed that the appellant’s prior
    custodial sentences, including penitentiary terms of incarceration, failed to
    deter him from his criminal conduct, as manifest by the fact that the predicate
    offences were committed while the appellant was still on parole from his last
    offences in 2005.  Those offences also
    involved fraud over $5,000, three counts of personation with intent, two counts
    of false pretences and uttering a forged document.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this context, the sentencing judge concluded
    that both general and specific deterrence, denunciation, and the need to
    separate the appellant from society in order to protect the public were the
    controlling principles of sentencing in this case.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also see no error in the sentencing judge’s treatment
    of the contents of the appellant’s pre-sentence report.  That report confirmed what the evidence
    before the sentencing judge otherwise established, namely, that neither
    community nor custodial sentences have deterred the appellant from his
    demonstrated pattern of criminal wrong-doing and that the appellant appears to
    have made no effort to date to rehabilitate himself.  To the extent that the author of the
    pre-sentence report offered an opinion regarding the appellant’s willingness to
    alter his behaviour in the future, this conformed with the mandatory direction
    contained in s. 721(3)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> that, “wherever possible”, a pre-sentence report contain information
    regarding an “offender’s age, maturity, character, behaviour, attitude and
    willingness to make amends”.  The
    sentencing judge’s reasons indicate that he did not consider the pre-sentence
    report in isolation but, rather, in the context of all the evidence before him
    relating to the appellant’s rehabilitative prospects.  This was unobjectionable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, having regard to the circumstances of
    this offender and these offences, the sentence imposed was fit.  The frauds perpetrated by the appellant
    involved considerable planning and preparation.  They were serious and sophisticated offences committed while the
    appellant was on parole for similar serious offences.  On the record before this court, greed
    appears to have been the only motivation for the appellant’s crimes.  These factors justify a significant
    penitentiary sentence.  See for example, <i>R. v. Kissondath</i> (2003), 174 O.A.C. 209
    (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Bradley</i> (2004), 357 A.R. 234 (Alta.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); and <i>R.
    v. Deutsch</i> (2005), 205 O.A.C. 272 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, while the appellant’s last sentence
    for earlier similar offences was two years and three months, an increase in the
    quantum of sentence is warranted where – as here – similar frauds that involve
    planning and sizeable funds are committed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, we would reject the appellant’s
    challenge to the custodial sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We reach a different conclusion, however,
    concerning the restitution order made by the sentencing judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge’s reasons contain no
    explication of the basis for the restitution order.  More importantly, it does not appear that the
    sentencing judge considered the appellant’s ability to make restitution prior
    to the imposition of the restitution order.  Nor, on the record before us, does it appear that any submissions were
    made to the sentencing judge concerning the appellant’s means or that the
    sentencing judge was otherwise provided with any information about the
    appellant’s personal financial circumstances.  This court has indicated that while the ability to pay is not a
    precondition to the making of a restitution order, it is a factor, among
    others, to be considered by a sentencing judge in determining whether to impose
    the obligation to make restitution.  See
    for example, <i>R. v. Perciballi</i> (2001),
    154 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );
    and <i>R. v. Devgan</i> (1999), 136 C.C.C.
    (3d) 238 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In these circumstances, we are of the view
    that the restitution order cannot stand.</p>
  <h2>III.       DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons given, leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the restitution order imposed by the sentencing judge is set aside
    and, in all other respects, the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
