  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is one of those regrettable cases where
    counsel was summonsed by the opposite party to testify against the interest of
    counsel’s own client.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged with building a deck
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Municipality
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Meaford (the Town)
    without having a building permit contrary to Ontario Regulation 403/97 and s.
    8(1) of the <i>Building Code Act</i>, 1992,
    S.O. 1992, c. 23.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the Town served a summons on counsel
    for the appellant requiring him to appear as a witness against his own
    client.  The appellant retained new
    counsel, who moved before Justice J.R. Sproat of the Superior Court of Justice
    for an order in the nature of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the summons.  The motion was
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal to this court, we allowed the appeal,
    set aside the order of the Superior Court judge and issued an order quashing
    the summons with reasons to follow.  These are the reasons.</p>
  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>1504413 Ontario Limited (the numbered company)
    retained Robert L. Jenkins to represent it in a dispute with the Town
    concerning a deck that was constructed without a building permit.  The Town retained John D. Middlebro’ to act
    on its behalf.  Unfortunately, the two
    lawyers did not get along particularly well as revealed in some of the correspondence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Middlebro’ took offence at certain
    submissions made to the court by Mr. Jenkins and demanded an apology in a
    letter to Mr. Jenkins dated 10 February 2005.  Mr. Middlebro’ went on to suggest in the letter that Mr. Jenkins was in
    a conflict of interest concerning comments he had made to employees of the
    Town.  He then recommended that Mr.
    Jenkins bring a motion to remove himself from the record.  No such motion was brought by Mr. Jenkins.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a further letter from Mr. Middlebro’ to Mr.
    Jenkins dated 12 May 2005, Mr. Middlebro’ said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As suggested in my
    letter to you of 10 February 2005, please be advised that you are likely to be
    summonsed to appear as a witness for the prosecution in these proceedings, and
    I anticipate the substance of your evidence to be as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>you were retained as solicitor for the defendant
    corporation during or about July of 2004;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>you performed various investigations on behalf
    of your client including corresponding with the municipality and commencing a
    Freedom of Information Act proceeding;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>you advised the investigator/recipient of your
    letters of 12 July 2004 and 29 July 2004 of your knowledge that your clients
    did not have a building permit to construct the deck on the marine road
    allowance, in writing; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that the corporation was subsequently charged
    with commencing construction without a build-ing permit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several weeks later on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of
    July, Mr. Middlebro’ forwarded a summons to Mr. Jenkins requiring him to attend
    at the Ontario Court of Justice in Owen Sound on the 1<sup>st</sup> of
    September 2005.  In the covering letter,
    Mr. Middlebro’ said: “I urge you to carefully [consider] your dual role as
    counsel and witness in th[is] provincial offence matter.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>certiorari</i> motion followed and was heard in Superior Court in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Owen Sound on March 24, 2006.  </p>
  <h2>The Reasons of the Motion Judge</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge reviewed two letters that Mr.
    Jenkins had written to the Chief Building Official of the Town and a third
    letter that he had written to the Information and Privacy Commissioner relating
    to the dispute between the numbered company and the Town.  After a review of this correspondence, the
    motion judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am therefore satisfied
    that the evidence of Mr. Jenkins, who confirmed that he sent this
    correspondence on behalf of the numbered company, is evidence that would be
    relevant and probative on the issue of who caused the deck to be built.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge agreed that there were
    considerations, other than the relevance of the evidence, when the subject of a
    summons is opposing counsel.  The motion
    judge, on the authority of <i>R. v. Chenier</i> [2001], O.J. No. 1279 (S.C.J.), accepted that the prosecution must demonstrate
    “that it is necessary to elicit the evidence from counsel as opposed to some
    other person”.  Counsel for the numbered
    company submitted to the motion judge that there were other known sources of
    the evidence which the prosecution sought to obtain.  In particular, he filed two newspaper
    articles concerning the removal of the deck in question in which the principal
    (Mrs. Grist) of the numbered company is quoted as making certain relevant
    admissions.  Counsel submitted that the
    prosecution could summons the newspaper reporters to obtain the desired
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge agreed that “if independent
    journalists confirm the accuracy of the stories, unless they are wrong in
    numerous references, there appear to be admissions by the principal of the
    numbered company with respect to the ownership of the deck.”  However, the motion judge went on to say:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So Mr. Crewe [then
    counsel for the numbered company] was correct to this extent, if evidence given
    by Mrs. Grist was as expected, based upon what I have recited, then there is
    not any reason to require Mr. Jenkins.  But if however, Mrs. Grist proves for some reason difficult to summons
    at this point and if in fact she is summonsed and comes to court and her
    evidence, contrary to Mr. Jenkins’ letters, contrary to the news articles, is
    that the numbered company has no know-ledge of the deck, then Mr. Middlebro’
    wants to be able to confront Mrs. Grist with the letters from Mr. Jenkins and
    if need be call Mr. Jenkins to give evidence indicating that these letters were
    sent on behalf of the numbered company.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think it is necessary
    within the meaning of the authorities to get this information from Mr. Jenkins,
    because it would be unfair to the crown to be blind-sided at trial by
    unexpected evidence from the numbered company through Mrs. Grist or other
    persons.  I can also appreciate the
    reluctance of the crown to be put in the position of having to call Mrs. Grist
    as its witness.</p>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is abundant authority for the proposition
    that the practice of calling counsel for the opposing side to testify against
    his or her client is the exception and should be avoided whenever
    possible.  When it is done, as in this
    case, involuntarily on the part of the counsel summonsed, it is highly
    undesirable and the court should be extremely wary of permitting it to
    happen.  The
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec
    Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. St-Laurent</i>,
    (1984) 11 C.C.C. (3d) 74 at 75-76 made the following observation in respect of
    the issuance of a subpoena to defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The authorities are
    unanimous to the effect that counsel for any party should avoid becoming
    involved as a witness; the practice is described as ‘highly undesirable’, and
    if it is not involuntary, it is unvariably the object of rebuke.  It is evident that a conflict of interest and
    of duty is likely.  It follows that
    counsel should avoid, if possible, calling his adversary; Crown counsel in this
    case does not appear to understand that.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All this must not be
    taken as denying the possibility that <i>extraordinary
    circumstances might conceivably arise in which the Crown</i>, without prior
    warning, <i><u>would have no alternative</u></i>.  This is no such case; the procedure,
    ironically, had no effect in any event on the Crown’s case, <i>and was totally unnecessary</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this court, in <i>R. v. Colbourne</i> [2001], O.J. No. 3620 at para. 51 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Doherty
    J.A. held that it is only where the proper administration of justice demands it,
    that counsel should be required to testify against his or her client:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is well established
    that while a prosecuting counsel (or defence counsel) is a compellable witness,
    he or she should only be compelled to abandon the role of counsel and assume
    the role of witness in cases where the proper administration of justice demands
    that counsel become a witness: <i>R. v.
    Kyling</i>, [1996] Q.J. No. 1566 (Que. Sup.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ct.) [C<span style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>t<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> J.].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the motion judge erred in concluding
    that the evidence of Mr. Jenkins was necessary to the Town’s case.  The motion judge’s suggestion that “it would
    be unfair to the crown to be blind-sided at trial by unexpected evidence from
    the numbered company through Mrs. Grist or other persons” is speculation and would
    not be sufficient to displace the heavy onus on the prosecution to demonstrate
    that it was necessary to call defence counsel.  There is nothing in the facts of this case to suggest, in the words of
    Doherty J.A., that “the proper administration of justice demands that counsel
    become a witness.”  There are no
    extraordinary circumstances that dictate that counsel for the Town had no
    alternative other than the unfortunate course he adopted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether as a matter of custom or policy, issuing
    a summons to counsel for the opposite party to testify against his or her
    client is virtually unheard of and it should not be done absent the most
    exceptional circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At a minimum, such circumstances would require a
    showing of high materiality and necessity (assuming that the proposed evidence
    is otherwise admissible).<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Although not exhaustive, necessity in this
    context will involve considerations such as the importance of the issue for
    which the testimony is sought, the degree of controversy surrounding the issue,
    the availability of other witnesses to give the evidence or other means by
    which it may be accomplished (such as the filing of an agreed statement of
    fact), the potential disruption of the trial process and the overall integrity
    of the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There were other issues raised before the motion
    judge and on this appeal.  However, on the
    view that I take of this case, I find it unnecessary to deal with them.  The only issue of consequence is whether the
    evidence sought from counsel for the numbered company was necessary for the
    proper administration of justice and in my view, it clearly was not.</p>
