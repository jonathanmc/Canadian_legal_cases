    Linamar Group, a large worldwide enterprise with operations in Europe and
    <st1:place

    North America.  The
    equipment consists of three custom machines designed and manufactured by IGMI

    setting aside the statement of claim and staying the action.  In a decision released on September 20, 2007,
    Harvison Young J. dismissed the motion.  She concluded that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice had
    jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> to hear the
    action brought by the respondents.  She
    also held that the action should not be stayed on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i> because of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    Ontario?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D. ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with an important contextual observation: the
    four issues on this appeal are closely linked.  Indeed, the reality is that resolution of the first issue comes very
    close to resolving the other three issues; there is a real cascading effect
    among the four issues.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       <u>Contract formation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that the motion judge erred in
    fact and in law by concluding that the sale contract had been completed in
    March 2004.  They submit that by
    mid-March 2004 the state of play was that the parties had reached only “an
    agreement to agree” and that until the detailed specifications for the
    equipment had been agreed to, there remained uncertainty with respect to a
    number of fundamental issues, precisely what the appellants were to supply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    motion judge comprehensively reviewed the evidentiary record.  It strongly supports her conclusion that the
    contract was formed by mid-March 2004.  By March 2004, the parties had agreed to the precise Giuliani machines,
    the purchase price, delivery dates, performance specifications and other
    matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the parties’ conduct in March 2004 and
    shortly thereafter confirmed their shared view that an agreement had been
    reached.  Invar paid 30 per cent of the
    contract price and IGMI started design and fabrication.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       <u>Dispute resolution forum</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    is the only forum for
    resolving disputes arising out of the contract.  The foundation for this submission is an article in the three order
    confirmation forms sent to the respondents by IGMI in September 2004:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>26.
    Arbitration</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For every dispute regarding the interpretation and execution
    of the present contract the Court of Ravenna, Subsection of Faenza, will be the
    only and exclusive competent court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this submission is that it is premised
    on the appellants’ contention that the contract was not formed until September
    2004 when the order confirmation forms were sent to the respondents.  However, I have concluded that there was no
    error in the motion judge’s conclusion that the contract was formed in March
    2004.  The motion judge observed: “None
    of the parties alleges that there was any discussion of the choice of law or
    jurisdiction issue during the spring of 2004.”  She then reviewed the evidence relating to documents exchanged and
    negotiations conducted over several months (March to September 2004) and
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having reviewed the evidence in this case, it
    appears that the plaintiffs and defendants each intended that there should be
    choice of jurisdiction provisions stipulating
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    respectively.  I cannot conclude,
    however, that there was any meeting of the minds on this issue at the time that
    the contract was formed in March, 2004, or that such terms later became part of
    the terms of this contractual relationship.</p>
  <p>I see no basis for disagreeing with this analysis and
    conclusion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       <u>Jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i></u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge set out the correct test on this
    issue, namely, whether there was a real and substantial connection between the
    action and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She also carefully considered the eight
    factors this court suggested are relevant under the test in <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002), 60 O.R.
    (3d) 20 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    and concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, that test is clearly met on the facts
    before the court.  The plaintiffs’
    connection with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    is very substantial.  <span lang=EN-GB>The machines, designed and built in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    ,
    were constructed for installation and use in the plaintiffs'
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario plant. The contract contemplated
    that the defendants would spend time in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    which they did. This is not a case where the defendant had no presence in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only argument advanced by the appellants on this
    issue is that the motion judge’s errors about the time when the contract was
    formed and the effect of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    jurisdiction provision in the order confirmation forms were carried into her
    analysis of the jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> issue.  Since I have concluded that the
    motion judge did not err on the first two issues, it follows that I see no
    error in her conclusion that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    courts have jurisdiction over the respondents’ action.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       <i><u>Forum</u></i><u> <i>non conveniens</i></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a motion to stay a proceeding on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, the test is
    whether there is clearly a more appropriate jurisdiction in which the case should
    be tried than the domestic forum chosen by the plaintiff: see <i>Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia
    (Workers’ Compensation Board</i>), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 at 921 and 931; and <i>Frymer v. Brettschneider</i> (1994), 19 O.R.
    (3d) 60 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge applied this test and the various
    factors relevant to its application.  Once again, the appellants’ main quarrel with her analysis is that she
    did not give effect to the alleged contractual provision specifying
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    as the
    dispute resolution forum.  Since I have
    concluded that the motion judge did not err on this issue, it follows that the
    appellants’ reliance on it on the <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> issue must also fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ other submission on this issue is that
    the existence of prior proceedings pending in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    dealing with the same dispute
    should have counted for more in the motion judge’s analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  The
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario action is an
    entirely appropriate action.  The factors
    connecting the parties, their contract, and the dispute concerning it all have
    a strong connection with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  They clearly support the motion judge’s
    conclusion, per <i>Amchem Products</i>, that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    is not “clearly a more appropriate jurisdiction in which the case should be
    tried than the forum chosen by the plaintiff.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make two final points.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the respondents contended before the motion
    judge that there would be a loss of juridical advantage if they were forced to
    pursue their claim in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Italy</st1:country-region>
    .  The motion judge rejected this submission: “I
    am reluctant to find that differences between Italian procedures and those of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario constitute
    losses of juridical advantages.”  I
    agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the respondents submit that the appellants’
    action in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    seeking
    recovery of the unpaid $688,500
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    under the contract was a so-called ‘torpedo action’ designed to forestall or
    trump proceedings by the respondents in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  I disagree.  On its face, the appellants’ action commenced in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    seems as appropriate as the respondents’
    action commenced in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In any event, whether the appellants’ action
    is appropriate or not, on ‘torpedo action’ or other grounds, is before the
    Italian court by virtue of a motion brought by the respondents and scheduled to
    be heard by the Italian court on April 9, 2008.  The Italian court is much better placed than this court to determine the <i>bona fides</i> of the appellants’ action
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    .</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  The respondents are entitled to their costs
    of the appeal which I would fix at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
