  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions and sentence for the
    aggravated assault and forcible confinement of the complainant.  The trial proceeded as a jury trial presided
    over by Hockin J. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who was self-represented at trial,
    argues a number of errors, beginning with the trial judge’s alleged failure to
    ensure that the appellant was represented by counsel at trial.  The appellant argues that his representation
    would have prevented alleged evidentiary errors respecting his conviction as
    well as errors respecting his sentence, which he argues was excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    appellant neither sought an adjournment to retain counsel nor asked the trial
    judge for any assistance to do so.  The
    appellant had been represented earlier in the proceedings, but after dismissing
    his counsel, he decided initially not to apply for a new legal aid lawyer and
    at a later appearance indicated that legal aid would not approve new
    counsel.  In appearances leading up to
    the trial, it was suggested to the appellant that he retain counsel, pursue
    legal aid, seek the advice of duty counsel, or make a <i>Charter</i> application for representation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was an experienced criminal law litigant
    and an obviously articulate individual.  He made it clear in his earlier appearances (including one before the
    trial judge) that he was going to represent himself and he expressed confidence
    in his ability to do so.  He failed to
    answer responsively to the trial judge’s two direct questions asking whether he
    wished to retain counsel.  Because he was
    in custody, he did not want his trial delayed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, and in the absence of any
    request for an adjournment or legal assistance, the trial judge was not obliged
    to force a self-represented accused to retain counsel or to conduct a lengthy
    inquiry about the reasons for his decision to represent himself.  See <i>R.
    v. McGibbon </i>(1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 334 at 346.  Moreover, the appellant’s confidence in his
    ability to represent himself persisted.  In his opening address, the appellant specifically told the jury that he
    was representing himself because of “my firm belief that there is no one save
    oneself that will fight for my innocence greater than I.”  The appellant also rejected the trial judge’s
    suggestion that he retain counsel for his sentencing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge adequately and fairly
    assisted the appellant during the trial in a number of ways, including by
    explaining the process to the appellant, explaining how to use the preliminary
    inquiry transcript, ensuring that the appellant had the opportunity to speak
    with witnesses, assisting the appellant with framing questions and in dealing
    with evidentiary matters.   However, the appellant argues inadequate
    assistance in the areas of hearsay, the s. 8 <i>Charter</i> <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>, the <i>Corbett</i> application and his “defence of property” theory.   We would not give effect to these arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided the appellant with a plain
    language explanation regarding hearsay and made it clear that he would give further
    guidance if asked.  We see no error when
    the trial judge stopped the appellant from adducing hearsay evidence and it was
    not incumbent upon him to review the law on hearsay again.  The appellant chose not to proceed with his
    line of questioning.  In any event, we
    are not persuaded that a greater grasp of the finer nuances of hearsay
    evidence, even if feasible, would have assisted the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was the one who raised the potential <i>Charter</i> violation and initiated the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>.  He arranged for duty counsel to explain the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> to the appellant, after which the appellant declined the trial judge’s offer to
    arrange for a more senior counsel to provide further advice.  We see no error on the part of the trial
    judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge raised the issue of a <i>Corbett</i> application despite the
    appellant’s intention not to testify.  He
    did so out of an abundance of caution explaining the purpose of the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> and that addressing the issue would ensure the appellant was fully informed if
    he changed his mind and decided to testify.  The appellant engaged in discussion about his record and made no
    objection to the procedure.  Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding the appellant’s “defence of property” theory,
    there was no evidence that the complainant was an uninvited trespasser in the
    appellant’s apartment.  In our view the
    appellant’s girlfriend’s evidence could not be seen to lend support to this
    defence and the trial judge did not err in not leaving the s. 41(1) defence
    with the jury because, on this record, there was no air of reality to that
    defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in our view, the trial judge took all
    appropriate steps to ensure the appellant’s fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we see no basis for the appellant’s argument
    that the effective sentence of four and a half years was demonstrably unfit
    given the nature of the offence, which was a prolonged and violent assault on a
    vulnerable victim, and the circumstances of the offender, which included a
    substantial criminal record with lengthy prior custodial terms.  In any event, the sentence appeal is moot. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal both as to
    conviction and sentence. </p>
