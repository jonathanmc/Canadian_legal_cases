  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal concerns the interpretation of the price-protection provisions of
    a contract between the appellants Commercial Alcohols Inc. (“CAI”), and the
    respondent, Suncor Energy Products Inc. (“Suncor” or “Sunoco”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early 1990s, Suncor decided to produce and sell ethanol-blended gasoline.  In
    1996 it signed a ten-year contract with CAI for the supply of ethanol.  Suncor
    agreed to purchase annually from CAI on a “take-or-pay” basis 130 million
    litres of ethanol at a price three cents per litre less than the wholesale
    price of gasoline.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the price-protection provisions of the contract
    – s. 19.3 – required CAI to match the price an alternate supplier of ethanol
    offered to Suncor, if the alternate offer provided for a contract term of
    at least one year and for the supply of at least 60 million litres of ethanol.  CAI
    could decline to match the offer only if it released Suncor from buying from
    CAI the amount of ethanol Suncor purchased from the alternate supplier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2005, Suncor received an offer from an alternate supplier that met both criteria
    in s. 19.3, and at a price 30 cents per litre less than the price Suncor
    had agreed to pay CAI.  Suncor asked CAI to match the offer or release it
    from its purchase obligation.  CAI refused, relying on s. 19.1 of the contract.  Section
    19.1 provides: “[i]t is the intention of the parties that in the event that
    an active market develops for Ethanol in Ontario, that Sunoco’s general competitiveness
    shall not become impaired as a result of its commitments under this Agreement.”  There
    was no active market for ethanol in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario because Suncor’s competitors in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    – Esso, Shell and Petro
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    – did not sell ethanol-blended gasoline.  CAI claimed that it was not required
    to match the alternate offer under s. 19.3 because the condition in s. 19.1
    had not been met.  It began an action in the Commercial List.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    narrow issue of contractual interpretation on which the action turned was
    whether, as CAI contended, s. 19.1 applies to offers under s. 19.3, or whether,
    as Suncor contended, s. 19.3 is a stand-alone provision.  After an 11-day
    trial, Ground J. found in favour of Suncor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    its appeal, CAI renews its argument that s. 19.1 informs s. 19.3 of the contract.  I
    would dismiss the appeal.  I agree substantially with the reasons of the
    trial judge.  Both the wording of s. 19 of the contract and the factual context
    in which the contract was signed support his conclusion that s. 19.3 operates
    independently of s. 19.1.  These reasons are intended to supplement those
    of the trial judge.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        RELEVANT FACTUAL
      BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h3>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Genesis
    of the contract</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    manufacture finished gasoline, a refiner mixes a variety of crude oils with
    other components.  The process is akin to mixing a cocktail.  Many components
    can be used, including ethanol, which is often made from corn.  Each refiner
    has its own recipe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge found, in the early 1990s Suncor decided to introduce ethanol-blended
    gasoline throughout
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, both in service stations using its brand name Sunoco, and in service
    stations it operated under the names Pioneer and UCO.  Suncor blended ethanol
    with gasoline on a one-to-nine ratio for sale to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario motorists.  Cars run just as well on the blend.  And the blend has
    marketing advantages: ethanol is seen as a “green” fuel, which is friendlier
    to the environment, and its use increases the market for corn, thus benefiting
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s farmers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    implement its decision to introduce ethanol-blended gasoline, Suncor needed
    a supplier of ethanol.  In the petroleum industry, long-term contracts for
    the supply of a component are unusual.  The industry is so competitive, that,
    in order to keep costs low, refiners prefer to be able to change components
    quickly and easily.  Long-term contracts limit their flexibility to do so.  Indeed,
    the trial judge found that the ten-year supply contract between Suncor and
    CAI was “unprecedented.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    being unusual, this long-term contract held advantages for both parties.  Suncor
    wanted a guaranteed long-term supply of ethanol to ensure the viability of
    its decision and to justify the cost of the capital investments required
    for ethanol blending.  CAI also wanted a long-term contract because it intended
    to build a state-of-the-art, world-scale production plant.  A long-term contract
    would allow CAI to obtain financing to build the plant, which was to be located
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chatham,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, and to service the debt.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    long-term supply contract</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1995, Suncor began negotiations with CAI for a long-term contract for the
    supply of ethanol.  Both parties were represented by counsel.  After nine
    months of intense negotiations, Suncor and CAI reached an agreement in principle.  They
    signed the contract on September 30, 1996.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    1.1 of the contract recites that CAI intended to build a “state of the art,
    world scale plant” in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Chatham.  Sections 1.2 and 4.6 stipulate that once CAI achieved full production
    at its plant, Suncor would purchase from CAI, on a take-or-pay basis, a minimum
    of 130 million litres of ethanol annually.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    14.3 of the contract sets the per-litre price Suncor must pay CAI: essentially
    Suncor’s wholesale price for regular unleaded gasoline less three cents.  Section
    12.1 set the initial term of the contract at ten years.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    price-protection provisions of the contract</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    contract contains three price-protection provisions in favour of Suncor – ss.
    18, 19.2 and 19.3.  Each becomes effective on the happening of certain events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    18 ensures that Suncor always gets CAI’s best price.  If CAI sells ethanol
    to a third party at a price lower than the s. 14.3 price, Suncor has the
    right to request this lower price.  Section 18 is not in issue on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.3 is in issue on the appeal, and s. 19.2 is relevant to the interpretation
    of s. 19.3.  Section 19 begins with this heading in block capitals:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“19.0 COMPETITIVENESS OF CAI ETHANOL PRICING WITH
    THE PRICING OF ETHANOL BY OTHERS SELLING IN THE
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.1, the section on which CAI relies, is headed “Intent,” and as I said
    earlier, states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the intention of the parties that in the
    event that an active market develops for Ethanol in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, that Sunoco’s general competitiveness shall not become impaired
    as a result of its commitments under this Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.2 is headed “CAI Price Match to Market Price,”
    and, importantly, begins with the words “To give effect to this intention”.  Under
    this provision, where significant amounts of ethanol – at least 100 million
    litres annually – are traded in Ontario at an average price lower than the
    section 14.3 price, CAI must match this lower price.  Section 19.2 provides,
    in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To give effect to this intention, the parties agree
    that during the term of this Agreement, in the event that Sunoco can demonstrate
    to CAI that:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        the annual traded volumes of Ethanol
    in Ontario (excluding Ethanol sales made pursuant to this Agreement) are
    equal to or        greater than 100 million litres, whether such volumes
    are produced in Ontario or imported (the “Ontario Market”); and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       that such volumes of Ethanol have
    traded in the Ontario Market for a period of at least one year at an average
    price (for Ethanol of like quality and on like payment terms) which is less
    than the average price over the same period paid pursuant to this Agreement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>then CAI shall provide a price reduction to Sunoco,
    and shall maintain such price reduction for so long as the average price
    in the Ontario Market remains lower than the average Ethanol Price provided
    pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement.  The price reduction shall be equal
    to the difference between the said average prices and shall be reviewed by
    the parties annually. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.2 then equates the establishment of an active market for ethanol with
    the annual trading of at least 100 million litres of ethanol:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For greater clarity, once it is established that
    an active market for Ethanol has developed and the active market price is
    less than the Ethanol Price calculated pursuant to section 14 of this Agreement
    then the parties will agree on a procedure for monitoring the active market
    and on an amendment so that the section 14 Ethanol Pricing Formula reflects
    market conditions and will in no event exceed the Ethanol Price under the
    Ethanol Pricing Formula.  In the event that the parties cannot agree on an
    Ethanol Pricing Formula Amendment it shall be determined by arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.3 is headed “CAI Price Match to Alternative Supply,” and begins with the
    words “The parties further agree…”.  Under s. 19.3, where Suncor receives
    a bona fide offer from another producer to supply at least 60 million litres
    of ethanol annually for a term of at least one year, at a price lower than
    the s. 14.3 price, CAI must match this lower price:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties further agree that, during the term
    of this Agreement, in the event that a then existing producer of Ethanol
    delivers a bona fide offer to supply an annual volume of at least 60 million
    litres of Ethanol of like quality and on a gasoline based pricing formula
    to Sunoco for a contract term of at least one year, and that such an offer
    provides for a discount which is higher than the 3 cents per litre provided
    for under this Agreement, then CAI shall increase the discount to match the
    alternate supply contract effective from the date that the alternate supplier
    has offered to supply Sunoco for the offered volume and for the offered contract
    term.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19.4 of the contract gives CAI the right to decline to match the price under
    either s. 19.2 or s. 19.3, provided that it releases Suncor from buying from
    CAI the volume of ethanol Suncor purchased from either the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <h3>(4)<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 2005, Suncor received an offer from Aventine Renewable Energy Inc. to
    supply up to 130 million litres of ethanol during the period July 1, 2005,
    to June 30, 2006, at a price about 30 cents per litre lower than the s. 14.3

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    CAI conceded that the Aventine offer satisfied all the criteria in s. 19.3
    of the contract, it refused to match the Aventine price or to release Suncor
    under s. 19.4.  Instead, CAI claimed that its obligations under ss. 19.3
    and 19.4 are triggered only if the conditions in section 19.1 are met.  The
    trial judge found that neither condition had been met.  There was no active
    market for ethanol in

    Ontario, and thus Suncor’s general competitiveness with other

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAI’s
    basic position is that the trial judge erred in concluding that s. 19.3 is
    an independent or stand-alone provision.  CAI submits that its obligations
    under s. 19.3 are tied to and informed by the conditions in s. 19.1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAI
    makes four points in support of this submission.  First, it says that s.
    19.3 is in the same section as s. 19.1 because it is subsidiary to s. 19.1.  If
    s. 19.3 were a stand-alone provision it would be in a separate section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    CAI says that ss. 19.2 and 19.3 are connected.  Section 19.2 begins with
    the words “To give effect to this intention,” and s. 19.3 with the words “The
    parties further agree”.  The two sections simply contemplate different scenarios
    in which an active market for ethanol can come about.  Section 19.2 addresses
    the scenario where the active market is a public market and the price is
    known; s. 19.3 addresses the scenario where one of Suncor’s competitors buys
    ethanol privately, and the purchase price is unknown.  In that case, an offer
    under s. 19.3, such as the offer from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Aventine, acts as a proxy for the competitor’s private purchase. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    CAI says that if s. 19.3 were an independent provision, then s. 19.2 would
    be unnecessary and therefore meaningless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    CAI says that interpreting s. 19.3 as an independent provision is commercially
    unreasonable because that interpretation would undermine Suncor’s ten-year
    commitment, on which CAI relied in building its new plant.  Suncor could
    obtain an offer from another supplier immediately after the contract was
    signed, thereby negating the core price provisions on which the contract
    was based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suncor’s
    basic position is that the trial judge was correct in concluding that s.
    19.3 is a stand-alone provision.  Suncor makes two main points in support
    of this position.  First, it says that the trial judge’s interpretation is
    supported by the plain wording of s. 19.3 and by the contrasting wording
    of s. 19.2.  On the other hand, CAI’s interpretation requires the court to
    read words into s. 19.3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Suncor says that in the light of the trial judge’s findings about the context
    in which the contract was signed, its interpretation of s. 19.3 is commercially
    reasonable, whereas CAI’s interpretation is commercially unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Suncor’s position.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting
    a contract</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    goal of contractual interpretation is to determine the intent of the parties
    when the contract was made.  To do so, the court looks at the words the parties
    used and the context in which the contract was signed.  Goudge J.A. concisely
    summarized the proper approach to contractual interpretation in his reasons
    in <i>Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada v. Scott’s Food Services Inc.</i>, [1998]
    O.J. No. 4368 at para. 25 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ): </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the task of interpretation must begin with
    the words of the document and their ordinary meaning, the general context
    that gave birth to the document or its “factual matrix” will also provide
    the court with useful assistance.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>See also a more extensive discussion
    of this approach by Doherty J.A. in <i>Dumbrell v. Regional Group of Companies</i> (2007),
    85 O.R. (3d) 616 at paras. 47-56 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  I begin with the wording of s. 19.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording of section 19</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plain wording of s. 19 strongly suggests that it is a stand-alone provision
    that applies regardless of whether an active market for ethanol has developed
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Apart from being in the same overall section, s. 19.3 is not tied
    in any way to s. 19.1.  Section 19.3 makes no reference to s. 19.1 or to
    the conditions in s. 19.1.  By contrast, s. 19.2 expressly refers both to
    the “intent” in s. 19.1 and to the “active market” condition in s. 19.1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept CAI’s contention that the opening words of s. 19.3, “The parties
    further agree,” is a substitute for the opening words of s. 19.2 “to give
    effect to this intention.”  If the parties had intended s. 19.3 to reflect
    the “intent” in s. 19.1, presumably they would have said something like “to
    further give effect to this intention.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the wording of s. 19.3 shows that the parties intended to address a scenario
    entirely different from the scenario in s. 19.2: where one of Sunoco’s competitors
    is not actively buying ethanol, yet Sunoco receives an offer from another
    producer to supply it with a substantial amount of ethanol at a price lower,
    than the s. 14.3 price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
    CAI’s interpretation of s. 19.3 strains the language of that provision and
    requires the court to read in words.  The notion that a s. 19.3 offer stands
    as a proxy for a private contract between an ethanol supplier and one of
    Suncor’s competitors is not in any way captured by the wording of s. 19.3.  The
    parties were represented by counsel throughout the negotiations.  If they
    had wanted to capture this notion, they would have said so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    interpreting s. 19.3 as an independent provision does not render s. 19.2
    meaningless.  For example, as Suncor points out and as the Aventine offer
    demonstrates, Suncor may be able to obtain a supply of 60 million litres
    of ethanol over a one-year term even though an active market for ethanol
    has not developed (that is, even though 100 million litres of ethanol has
    not yet been traded annually in Ontario at an average price lower than the
    average price paid by Suncor under s. 14.3 of the contract).  Or, to use
    another example, at least 100 million litres of ethanol could trade annually
    even though no single producer had been willing to supply 60 million litres
    to Suncor for at least a one-year term and at a lower price than Suncor pays
    under section 14.3.  Both of these examples show that interpreting s. 19.3
    as an independent provision does not make s. 19.2 unnecessary to ensure Suncor’s
    price protection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plain wording of s. 19 shows that s. 19.3 is a stand-alone provision.  Section
    19.3 does not depend on the conditions in section 19.1 having been met.  Moreover,
    the trial judge’s findings on the context in which the contract was signed
    support the commercial reasonableness of this interpretation.</p>
  <h3>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    context in which the contract was signed</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made numerous findings of fact about the context in which the
    contract was signed.  These findings, which were not challenged on appeal,
    show the commercial reasonableness of Suncor’s interpretation of s. 19.3.  Here
    I will refer only to those contextual findings that I consider particularly
    important.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the production and marketing of gasoline is highly competitive, especially
    on costs.  The price of crude oil, which is the principal ingredient of gasoline,
    is determined by North American or world prices.  To be competitive, Suncor
    must price its gasoline at the market price.  It cannot charge more simply
    because its gasoline contains ethanol.  Thus, when entering into the long-term
    supply contract with CAI, Suncor needed to ensure that it would not pay an
    above-market price for ethanol.  If it did so, it would be taking on a cost
    for one of its components that other refiners were not taking on for their
    components.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    an alternate supplier provision containing a price-match clause is a typical
    term in a supply contract.  Section 19.3, therefore, is typical and does
    not undermine the parties’ bargain.  It merely requires CAI to sell ethanol
    to Suncor at the same price as another supplier is willing to sell ethanol
    to Suncor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    s. 19.3 is not onerous.  As the trial judge said at para. 35 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To grant this protection to Suncor, whether or
    not there is an active market for ethanol in Ontario, also appears to me
    to be reasonable in that it was contemplated by both parties at the time
    of entering into the Agreement that the plant to be constructed by CAI would
    be a modern, state of the art, cost efficient plant which would be competitive
    with ethanol producers within or outside Ontario…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the conditions that must be met to trigger CAI’s obligations under s. 19.3
    are stringent.  Although in theory, as CAI contends, Suncor could have obtained
    an alternate offer for 60 million litres of ethanol for a term of at least
    one year immediately after signing its contract with CAI, that was highly
    unlikely.  The trial judge found “that, at the time of entering into the
    Agreement, there were no offers or agreements available for the supply of
    ethanol for a period of one year or more”.  The Aventine offer shows the
    validity of the trial judge’s finding; that offer came nearly nine years
    after the contract was signed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    Suncor’s interpretation of s. 19.3 accords with each party’s interest when
    the contract was signed.  CAI wanted a ten-year, take-or-pay contract to
    obtain financing to build its plant.  Suncor wanted to ensure that it was
    not paying an above-market price for ethanol.  The trial judge found that
    the parties balanced their interests by ensuring Suncor was committed to
    buying ethanol from CAI unless the market price for ethanol was lower than
    the price under s. 14.3 of the contract.  In short, Suncor received price
    protection in exchange for taking on a ten-year, take-or-pay obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    these contextual considerations, grounded in the trial judge’s unassailable
    findings of fact, demonstrate the commercial reasonableness of interpreting
    s. 19.3 as an independent price-protection provision.</p>

      CAI’s appeal with costs in the amount agreed to by counsel, $20,000, all-inclusive.</span></p>
