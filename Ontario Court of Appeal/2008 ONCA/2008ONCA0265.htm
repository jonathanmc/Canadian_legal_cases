    union brought a certification application before the Ontario Labour Relations
    Board.  The employer prepared a response in which it challenged the identity
    and numbers of persons in the proposed bargaining unit.  It served the response
    on the union but, through inadvertence, neglected to file its response with
    the Board within the two-day statutory time limit.  Consequently, based solely
    on the information provided by the union, the Board made the requested certification
    order.</p>

    employer asked the Board for an extension of time in which to file its response
    and for a reconsideration.  The Board undertook a reconsideration.  However,
    relying on a prior Board decision which held that the Board had no authority
    to extend a time limit set out in s. 128.1 of the <i>Labour Relations Act,
    1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c.1, Sch. A (the “<i>LRA</i>”), the Board did not consider
    the employer’s response.  It affirmed the certification order.  </p>

    June 13, 2006, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (“the

    the <i>LRA</i>.  The application to the

    Ontario Labour Relations Board (“the Board”) was made in respect of all “glaziers
    and glazier apprentices” employed by Maystar General Contractors Inc. (“Maystar”).  The

    proposed province-wide bargaining unit working at a Maystar jobsite in

    Union. In its response, Maystar contended that the two glaziers were contractors
    and not employees for the purposes of the <i>LRA</i>.  Alternatively, if
    the two workers were found to be employees, then Maystar contended that it
    had eight such employees on four different job sites on June 13, 2006.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    reading the Board decision, Maystar discovered that the Board had not received

    decision.  In its request for reconsideration, Maystar explained that its
    response had been supplied to the
    <st1:place

    Union within the two days required by s. 128.1(3) but “through administrative
    error”, it had not been filed with the Board at the same time.  Maystar asked

    June 28, 2007, while the leave application was outstanding, the Board reconsidered
    the certification application.  The Board determined that it should exercise
    its discretion and permit the late filing of Maystar’s response.  On the
    basis of the application filed by the Union and Maystar’s response, the Board
    was not able to determine the percentage of employees in the bargaining unit
    who were members of the

    Board ruled that the matter would be determined following a regional certification

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 is the seminal case on the doctrine
    of mootness.  In <i>Borowski</i> at 353, Sopinka J. explains the doctrine
    in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The doctrine of mootness is an aspect
    of a general policy or practice that a court may decline to decide a case
    which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question.  The general principle
    applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving
    some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties.  If
    the decision of the court will have no practical effect on such rights, the
    court will decline to decide the case.  This essential ingredient must be
    present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but at the time
    when the court is called upon to reach a decision.  Accordingly if, subsequent
    to the initiation of the action or proceeding, events occur which affect
    the relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists
    which affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot.  The
    general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises
    its discretion to depart from its policy or practice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court revisited the doctrine of mootness more recently in <i>Tamil Co-operative
    Homes Inc. v. Arulappah </i>(2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 566.  In <i>Tamil Co-operative</i> at
    para. 13, Doherty J.A., writing for the court, describes the approach the
    court is to take when deciding the question of mootness:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Courts exist to resolve real disputes between parties
    and not to provide opinions in response to hypothetical or academic problems.  Courts
    will, however, on occasion address the merits of an appeal even where the
    dispute giving rise to the appeal has dissolved.  Where a question of mootness
    is raised, the court must first decide whether the appeal is moot.  If the
    appeal is moot, the court must then decide whether it should nonetheless
    hear the merits of the appeal.  The discretion to hear a moot appeal is intended
    to address those exceptional cases where the circumstances are such that
    the general rule against hearing appeals where there is no live controversy
    between the parties should not be followed …  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As

    the first stage of analysis, the court must determine whether the appeal
    is moot.  Making that determination in this case requires a consideration
    of whether, after the Events, a live controversy remains: see <i>Borowski </i>at
    354.  If not, the appeal is moot.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    controversy that drives this appeal is whether the Board can consider the
    information proffered by Maystar.  The Board decision of June 28, 2007 makes
    it clear that not only has the Board determined that it can consider the
    information but that the Board has, in fact, considered it and acted on it.  It
    was as a result of Maystar’s response, in conjunction with the Union application,
    that the Board revoked the certificates it had granted to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union.  Thus, a decision of this court on the merits of the appeal would
    have no practical effect.  Viewing the matter substantively, the controversy
    this court is asked to resolve on the appeal has been overtaken by the post-judicial
    review events, in particular, the subsequent orders of the Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    more technical analysis also compels the conclusion that the appeal is moot.  The
    Union asked the court to set aside the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court order and restore the Board’s decision certifying the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union.  However, this court cannot restore the Board Decision for three reasons.  First,
    the Board Decision is no longer the operative order in this ongoing certification
    battle, as it has been supplanted by the later Board decisions.  Second,
    reinstatement of the certification order is no longer possible because the
    Board revoked the certification by means of its June 28, 2007 decision.  Third,
    the Board decision of June 28, 2007, is not before us.  Therefore, it would
    be improper to effectively overturn that decision, which is what restoration
    of the Board Decision would accomplish.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Union also argues that were this court to set aside the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court order, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union could go back to the Board and invite it to reconsider its decision
    of June 2007 in which it revoked the certification.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union submits that armed with a favourable decision from this court, it would
    ask the Board to restore the certification order made in 2006.  Given the
    material now before the Board and the post-judicial review events, it is
    not clear that setting aside the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court order would lead to such a reconsideration.  The Events
    have clarified the nature of the dispute between the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union and Maystar such that the procedural issues that arise in respect of
    s. 128.1(3) may no longer govern the outcome.  The Board now knows there
    is a real issue concerning the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s right to certification.  It is difficult to see the Board ignoring
    the real controversy and restoring an order which been made in the absence
    of such knowledge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the appeal is moot because the relief sought by the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union is no longer available and because the Events have reshaped the dispute
    between the parties such that the issue this court is asked to decide is
    not determinative of that dispute.        </p>

    concluded that the appeal is moot, the second stage of analysis requires
    a determination as to whether, nonetheless, the court should decide the appeal

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In exercising its discretion, the

    am satisfied that the first factor – an appropriate adversarial context – exists
    in this case.  The litigants have continued to argue their respective positions
    vigourously.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second factor relates to a concern for conserving scarce judicial resources.  In
    deciding whether an expenditure of judicial resources is warranted, the court
    is to consider the importance of the issues raised and whether the issues
    are
    “evasive of review”:  see <i>Borowski </i>at 360,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>New Brunswick</i><i> </i>at para. 45 and <i>Doucet-Boudreau v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two issues.  The first is whether the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in applying a standard of review of correctness to
    the Board Decision.  The second is whether the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in holding that the Board’s interpretation of s. 128.1(3)
    of the <i>LRA </i>was incorrect (the “Procedural Issue”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question but that both issues are important.  However, the importance
    of the legal issues is not determinative of the matter.  As Doherty J. A.
    explains in <i>Tamil Co-operative </i>at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The importance of a legal issue raised in a proceeding
    is a relevant consideration in determining whether a court should hear a
    moot appeal.  It is not, however, determinative.  There are an almost infinite
    number of important legal issues lurking in the myriad of rules and regulations
    governing the citizenry upon which those interested in the issue would appreciate
    the opinion of an appellate court.  If the importance of a legal issue is
    enough to overcome concerns associated with hearing moot appeals, the doctrine
    has little value.  It means no more than that the court should not waste
    its time and resources deciding unimportant legal issues in cases where there
    is no longer a live dispute between the parties.  This would seem self-evident.  <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the issues are not of public importance in the way in which that phrase has
    been understood in this area.  This factor requires a consideration of the
    public importance in resolving the issues raised on appeal, a consideration
    related to the social cost of continued uncertainty in the law.  As discussed
    in <i>Tamil Co-operative</i> at para. 26, the cases which meet this criterion
    have generally addressed questions of broad social and constitutional importance.  While
    the matters in issue in this appeal are important, they do not raise questions
    of that sort.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    neither issue raised on appeal is “evasive of review”.  Generally, a matter
    is evasive of review if it is unlikely that the court will encounter it again
    or if it tends to be moot by the time it reaches the reviewing court.  One
    example of this type of matter is that given in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>New Brunswick</i><i> </i>at para. 47: an interlocutory injunction prohibiting
    certain strike action.  The certification provisions in question are relatively
    new, having only come into effect on June 13, 2005.  It stands to reason
    that the Board will make many decisions that involve those provisions and
    that the procedures the Board follows in arriving at those decisions will
    be scrutinized through the judicial review process; hence, the Procedural
    Issue will be addressed.  There is no question but that the issue of the
    standard of review to be applied to Board decisions in respect of those provisions
    will be revisited in those judicial review proceedings.  Thus, I do not see
    the issues as evasive of review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third factor to be considered in relation to mootness is the need for the
    court to be sensitive to its role as the adjudicative branch in our political
    framework.  A court may decline to hear a moot case where it would require
    “departing from its traditional role as an adjudicator [or] intruding upon
    the legislative or executive sphere: <i>Doucet-Boudreau </i>at para. 22.  This
    concern does not arise in the present case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would decline to exercise the court’s discretion to decide the appeal on
    the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, however, with the following caution.  Nothing in these reasons
    should be taken as affirming the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s view that the appropriate standard of review of the Board
    Decision was correctness and that no deference was owed to the Board in its
    interpretation of the relevant certification provisions in the <i>LRA</i>.  The
    decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, over the course of many decades,
    show an unbroken commitment to affording labour relations boards the highest
    levels of judicial deference on matters within their exclusive jurisdiction.  See,
    for example, <i>Canadian
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union of Public Employees Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp</i>., [1979]
    2 S.C.R. 227,

    governing the certification process in the construction industry are such
    matters.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the nomenclature of old, Board decisions were not to be set aside unless
    they were patently unreasonable or clearly irrational.  <i>Dunsmuir v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i>, 2008 SCC 9, has simplified the standard of review analysis
    with the result that there are now only two standards of review: correctness
    and reasonableness.  However, both the result and the reasoning in <i>Dunsmuir</i> affirm
    a continuing stance of deference in the field of labour relations.  In <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    a standard of reasonableness was held to apply when reviewing the decision
    of an adjudicator made under the <i>Public Service Labour Relations Act</i>,
    R.S.N.B. 1973, c. P-25.  The majority in <i>Dunsmuir </i>notes that an exhaustive
    analysis is not required in every case to determine the proper standard of
    review:  if the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner
    the degree of deference to be accorded a decision maker with regard to a
    particular category of question, the search for the appropriate standard
    is over.  If not, then the usual factors are to be considered.  Deference
    will “usually result” where a decision maker is interpreting its own statute,
    with which it will have particular familiarity.  Deference is also warranted
    where the decision maker has particular expertise in the application of legal
    rules in a specific statutory context.  The majority also noted that a question
    of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and which is
    outside the specialized area of expertise of the decision maker will always
    attract a correctness standard.  I do not see the Procedural Issue as raising
    a question of that nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appreciating
    the need for deference on matters within the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction
    further militates against deciding the present appeal on the merits.  A decision
    on the Procedural Issue would require the court to analyze what appear to
    be two competing lines of Board authority and to perhaps accept one and reject
    the other.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  If nothing else, it would be foolhardy for this
    court to pre-emptively interpret complicated statutory provisions involving
    practices and procedures of which the court knows very little, before the
    Board has an opportunity to consider and, perhaps, reconcile those authorities.  To
    embark on a review of the merits would require this court to do precisely
    what the jurisprudence indicates is improper
    – rather than defer to the Board, it would have this court dictate the process
    the Board is to follow when making decisions on certification, a matter within
    its exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
