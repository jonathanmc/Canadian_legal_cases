  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    being involved in three motor vehicle accidents in the span of six years,
    Suzanne Monks was rendered an incomplete quadriplegic.  She suffers from
    a multitude of serious medical problems and is confined mostly to bed.  She
    is mainly dependent upon medications and attendant care and is disabled from
    her former job in the insurance industry as a rehabilitation consultant and
    case manager, as well as from any other form of gainful employment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    Insurance Company of Canada (ING) was Ms. Monks’ automobile insurer when
    the third and final accident took place in 1998.  At that time, the <i>Statutory
    Accidents Benefits Schedule – Accidents on or after November 1, 1996</i>,
    O. Reg. 403/96 (the SABS) under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c.
    I. 8 (the Act) governed entitlement to no-fault first party accident benefits
    arising out of accidents that occurred on or after November 1, 1996.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    paid Ms. Monks statutory accident benefits in respect of the third accident
    for about three and one-half years, on a without prejudice basis.  Thereafter,
    it terminated any further payments and sought repayment of some payments
    already made on the basis that Ms. Monks allegedly was not “catastrophically
    impaired” within the meaning of the SABS.  Ms. Monks sued ING, claiming declaratory
    relief and an award of aggravated damages.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    almost two months of trial, Lalonde J. of the Superior Court of Justice declared
    that Ms. Monks had suffered a catastrophic impairment as a result of the
    third accident and that she was entitled to receive from ING the statutory
    accident benefits to which a catastrophically impaired person is entitled
    under the SABS.  He also granted specific declarations regarding her entitlement
    to income replacement benefits, past and ongoing medical, rehabilitation
    and attendant care benefits, and housekeeping and home modification expenses.  In
    addition, he awarded Ms. Monks $50,000 in aggravated damages, plus interest
    and costs.  He also awarded her counsel a $75,000 risk premium.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    appeals on several grounds.  Its main submission is that the trial judge
    made numerous errors of fact and law, the cumulative effect of which ING
    claims gave rise to a result at trial that is “so tainted that the only just
    remedy is a new trial”.  In particular, ING challenges the grant of declaratory
    relief relating to ongoing accident benefits and the trial judge’s awards
    of aggravated damages and a risk premium.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part, by setting aside
    the risk premium awarded by the trial judge.  In all other respects, I would
    dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not propose to review in detail the factual background giving rise to
    this appeal.  It is set forth in the reasons of the trial judge, which are
    409 pages and 1,243 paragraphs in length.  As relevant to the issues on appeal,
    however, the following facts should be emphasized.</p>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'><i>The Accidents and Ms. Monks’ Injuries</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    February 1993, Ms. Monks was involved in a relatively minor car accident
    in which she sustained a whiplash-type injury that resolved within two to
    three months.  The parties agree that the consequences of this accident have
    little relevance to the issues on this appeal.  X-rays taken after the accident
    revealed the onset of a degenerative disc disease in Ms. Monks’ spine.  The
    progression of the disease was not significant at that time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second accident, which occurred on July 2, 1995, was more serious.  The parties
    are sharply divided on the extent and severity of Ms. Monks’ injuries arising
    from this accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    maintains that the injuries were severe and progressive.  It claims that
    during the two and one-half years following the accident, Ms. Monks “experienced
    symptom intensification and a marked decline in her overall condition” that
    had a
    “marked and debilitating effect on her work, her household duties and her
    social activities”.  It points out that MRI studies conducted in 1996 and
    1997 disclosed a narrowing of Ms. Monks’ spinal canal to six millimetres
    (normal limits are twelve to thirteen millimetres).  This meant that there
    was no reserve room in her spinal cord and that any sudden extension of her
    neck could further compromise her spinal canal, leading to irreversible spinal
    cord injury.  As a result, after the 1995 accident, Ms. Monks was advised
    to avoid activities that would place her at risk of further neck injuries.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    contrast, while Ms. Monks acknowledges a constellation of injuries after
    the 1995 accident, she denies that they had the debilitating effects alleged
    by ING and maintains that ING’s depiction of the severity of the injuries
    is “grossly exaggerated”.  For example, at trial, she testified that she
    continued to work after the second accident, although she reduced her weekly
    work hours from about eighty to approximately forty hours.  She also continued
    to take on complex files and, as confirmed by her supervisor, there was no
    decline in the quality of her work.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    there is no debate that the 1995 accident did have some negative effect on
    Ms. Monks’ spinal condition.  As a result, Ms. Monks explored the possibility
    of surgery to relieve the pressure on her spinal cord with Dr. Howard Lesiuk,
    her treating neurosurgeon.  He recommended a conservative – <i>i.e.</i> non-surgical – approach,
    feeling that her condition would not necessarily worsen without surgery,
    which carried its own risks.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third accident took place on December 23, 1998.  Ms. Monks’ immediate injuries
    did not appear to be extensive.  No neurological “focal deficits” were revealed
    in examinations of her at the hospital shortly after the accident, and she
    was released with a neck collar.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately,
    as time passed, Ms. Monks’
    symptoms of injury intensified and she experienced increasing pain in her
    neck, discomfort in her arms, limited neck and head mobility, and constant
    headaches.  The results of a June 1999 MRI examination were viewed by Dr.
    Lesiuk as signifying neural tissue damage and a clear indication for surgical
    intervention.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result, Ms. Monks underwent spinal decompression surgery in 1999 and again
    in 2001 to arrest the deterioration in her spine.  Although these operations
    prevented her from becoming a complete quadriplegic, her condition did not
    improve and she eventually became an incomplete quadriplegic.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Monks, who is 52 years of age, now suffers from spastic quadriparesis (weakness
    of the limbs), chronic pain in her neck and shoulders, gait ataxia (decreased
    balance, trunk strength and stability), gastrointestinal dysfunction (persistent
    nausea and vomiting), lack of control over her bowel and bladder functions,
    depression, extreme fatigue, sleep apnea, and problems with concentration
    and memory.  She requires a host of ongoing medication, rehabilitative and
    assistive measures, vehicular and home modifications, therapies and attendant
    care.</p>

    May 31, 2002, approximately one month after the Zurich Settlement, ING terminated
    any further accident benefits payments to Ms. Monks concerning the third
    accident, claiming that she was not catastrophically impaired within the

    second accidents and her pre-existing spinal disease.  Ms. Monks maintained
    that while the second accident played a role in causing her injuries, the

    significant role” in the development of Ms. Monks’ ultimate condition, the
    third accident was a significant factor in hastening and accelerating her
    symptoms and overall condition.  In this sense, Dr. Lesiuk said, the third
    accident “played a lesser but still very significant role” and “contributed
    materially” to Ms. Monks’ condition.  Dr. Lesiuk also testified that, before
    the third accident, there was a 60% chance that Ms. Monks’ symptoms could
    stabilize barring any further injury.  For her part, Dr. Vandewaetere, who
    treated Ms. Monks before and after the third accident, stated in a report
    dated September 5, 2002: “I also believe that the [third] motor vehicle accident …
    was the final blow to her spinal cord and was the proverbial ‘straw that
    broke the camel’s back’.”</p>

    Robert Hansebout, a neurosurgeon like Dr. Lesiuk, was ING’s main witness
    on causation.  He testified that the third accident had a “very minor role” in
    causing Ms. Monks’ disability and that virtually all her medical difficulties
    were attributable to compression of her spinal cord due to a natural progression
    of her degenerative spinal disease.  Dr. Bruce Stewart, a defence neurologist,
    also testified that the third accident contributed “only a minor element” to
    Ms. Monks’ disability, although in his view it did aggravate her symptoms.  He
    suggested that 10% or less of Ms. Monks’ impairment could be attributed to
    this accident.</p>

    the second day of trial, ING moved for an order that evidence concerning
    Ms. Monks’ past and future care needs was inadmissible, in part on the basis
    that the trial judge allegedly had no jurisdiction to order the payment of
    expenses that had not been “incurred” or to make “an Order into the future
    relating to accident benefits”.  In a ruling dated February 1, 2005, the
    trial judge dismissed ING’s motion.  He held,
    “I need to know what current benefits were paid in the past, what benefits
    are currently being paid, and how such benefits will be projected into the
    future.”  Thereafter, extensive evidence was led at trial concerning Ms.&nbsp;Monks’ past

    relies on the decision of this court in <i>Monachino v. Liberty Mutual</i> (2000),
    47 O.R. (3d) 481.  There, a plaintiff with brain damage sought a declaration
    regarding his entitlement to receive ongoing weekly income and future care
    benefits under a prede-cessor schedule to the SABS in accordance with a proposed
    long-term care program under a future care plan prepared by a psychologist.  Citing
    the seminal case of <i>Solosky v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, Finlayson
    J.A. noted in <i>Monachino</i> at para. 20 the two criteria that must be
    satisfied in order to grant declaratory relief: “[T]he case before the court
    must be genuine, not moot or hypothetical; and the declaration must be capable
    of having some practical effect in resolving the issues the case raises.”</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the facts in <i>Monachino</i>, Finlayson J.A. held that it was premature
    to impose obligations arising from the future care plan in question because
    it met neither of these requirements.  In addition, there was no evidence
    before the court that the benefits found to be appropriate for the injured
    plaintiff had not been paid without the intervention of the court (at para.
    24).  Thus, although the requested declaration was not available at the time
    sought in <i>Monachino</i>, this court implicitly recognized that declaratory
    relief in respect of ongoing statutory accident benefits may be granted on
    a sufficient evidentiary record where the criteria for declaratory relief
    identified in <i>Solosky</i> are met.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    defence of the declarations granted by the trial judge, Ms. Monks relies
    on the decision of this court in <i>Coombe v. Constitution Insurance Co</i>.
    (1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 729, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (1981) 35 N.R.
    355.  In <i>Coombe</i>, a declaratory order had been made that a fully disabled
    claimant was entitled to indefinite income replacement benefits under a predecessor
    schedule to the SABS.  Justice Wilson, writing for a majority of this court,
    recognized the validity of the declaration for so long as the insured remained
    permanently and totally disabled (p. 736):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It follows from this analysis of the statute and
    of [the declaration made by the court] that the insurer cuts off weekly benefits
    to the insured at its own risk.  It is not, in my view, for the plaintiff
    to establish that he continues week by week to be permanently and totally
    disabled.  It is for the defendant to establish that he has ceased to be
    so and that [the declaratory order] is therefore no longer binding on it …  It
    is, in my view, unthinkable that an insured be put under an ongoing burden
    to establish his permanent and total disability and I cannot think that the
    Legislature could have intended it.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>These comments are apposite here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this case is more closely analogous to <i>Coombe</i> than it is
    to <i>Monachino</i>.  In contrast to <i>Monachino</i>, the declarations in
    issue here are neither hypo-thetical nor moot.  Nor are they remote to the
    issues in dispute.  The nature of ING’s defences to Ms. Monks’ benefits claims
    made her entitlement to past and ongoing benefits one of the critical issues
    in dispute.  Furthermore, there is no suggestion that the disputed ongoing
    benefits were or would be paid without the intervention of the court.  From
    May 2002 onwards, ING’s position that no further benefits would be paid was
    clear and unequivocal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    ING argues that a declaration of rights and obligations is appropriate only
    to the extent that it co-exists with and does not ignore applicable legislation.  It
    submits that the impugned declarations in this case are unlawful because
    they allegedly “sweep aside” the SABS provisions for the determination of
    benefits claims.  I would not accept this contention. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the impugned declarations –
    properly read – co-exist with the scheme envisaged by the SABS for the determination
    of accident benefits and no inconsistency between the declarations and the
    SABS arises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge explicitly held that the types of ongoing benefits claimed by
    Ms. Monks were reasonable and necessary having regard to her existing care
    requirements at the time of trial.  The result of this finding, which underpins
    the challenged declarations, is that Ms. Monks is entitled to the ongoing
    benefits in question subject to proof, in accordance with the SABS, of specific
    expenses falling within each category of benefits.  By virtue of the declarations,
    while she will be obliged to substantiate specific expense claims, Ms. Monks
    will not be required to again establish that the expenses claimed are “reasonable
    and necessary”.  It will be for ING to prove, if so advised, that they are
    not.  As the trial judge observed at para. 18 of his ruling at the outset
    of trial, mentioned above, “Once I make a declaration, it will mean that
    the benefits are ongoing only, and the plaintiff will enjoy such benefits
    until the defendant is able to prove she is not entitled to future benefits.”  This
    is entirely consistent with the approach approved by this court in <i>Coombe</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    does not override the requirements of the SABS.  Nor do I understand Ms.
    Monks to argue to the contrary.  Indeed, she acknowledged before this court
    that the ongoing benefits declarations do not relieve her from her obligations
    to submit the forms and other documents contemplated by the SABS in respect
    of a particular benefit claim.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  At the same time, however, as Ms. Monks stated in her factum: “But in
    the same manner as in <i>Coombe</i> above, Ms. Monks should not be put to
    an ‘ongoing burden’ to prove to ING that [the identified ongoing benefits]
    continue to be ‘reasonable and necessary’.”  Again, I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    there is no suggestion here that the effect of the challenged declarations
    is to bypass other mandatory provisions of the SABS.  For example, on a plain
    reading, the declarations do not purport to supercede those sections of the
    SABS that establish the maximum rate or amount of medical, rehabilitation
    and attendant care expenses (see for example, ss. 14(4), 14(4.1), 15(6),
    15(6.1), 15(8), and 16(5) of the SABS) or that fix the duration of benefits
    payable under the SABS (s. 18).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    ING’s submission that the ongoing benefits declarations ignore the SABS provisions
    that contemplate the payment of benefits only for “incurred” expenses must
    also fail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute that one of the pre-conditions to the receipt of accident benefits
    under the SABS is that the cost or expense in question be “incurred”.  For
    example, ss. 14(2) and 16(2) of the SABS provide that medical and attendant
    care benefits must pay for “all reasonable and necessary <i>expenses</i> <i>incurred
    by or on behalf of the injured person</i> as a result of the accident” [emphasis
    added] and s. 15(2) states that a rehabilitation benefit must pay for “all
    reasonable and necessary <i>measures</i> <i>undertaken</i>” by the insured
    person.  [Emphasis added.]  See also <i>Monachino</i> at para. 10.  Rather,
    the issue in conten-tion is the meaning to be accorded to the word “incurred” as
    used in the SABS. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    argues that the word “incurred” as employed in the SABS requires a legal
    liability for payment or a certainty that the claimed expense will arise.  This
    is said to preclude, for example, the declaratory relief granted with respect
    to home modifications because Ms. Monks can choose whether or not to renovate
    her home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    courts, however, have rejected a narrow construction of the word “incurred” as
    used in accident benefits schedules.  In <i>Belair Insurance Co. v. McMichael</i> (2007),
    86 O.R. (3d) 68 at para. 24, when considering the meaning of “incurred” in
    the context of the attendant care provisions of the SABS, the Divisional
    Court cited with approval the following statement in <i>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance
    Co. v. Smith</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 441 (

    similar approach to the interpretation of

    by arbitrators involved in the resolution of disputes about the payment of
    accident benefits: see <i>Kennelly v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</i>,

    interpretive approach is consistent with the principles applicable to the
    construction of insurance coverage provisions.  It is well-established that
    insurance coverage provisions are to be interpreted broadly, while coverage
    exclusions or restrictions are to be construed narrowly, in favour of the
    insured.  At the time of Ms. Monks’ third accident, the SABS was deemed to
    be incorporated in every standard automobile insurance policy in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario by virtue of s. 268(1) of the Act.  Consequently, to the extent that
    the word “incurred” as used in the SABS restricts the coverage available
    to Ms. Monks under her ING policy, it must be assigned a narrow meaning.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    a broad interpretation of the word “incurred”
    under the SABS is consistent with the policy objective that accident victims
    promptly receive the statutory accident benefits to which they are entitled
    under the Act and their automobile insurance policies.  It also prevents
    an insurer from benefitting from an insured’s lack of financial resources.  As
    Wilson J.A. observed in <i>Coombe</i> at p. 736: “The legislation was designed

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I turn to the last prong of ING’s attack on the declarations in issue.  This
    concerns the trial judge’s directions that ING pay certain ongoing benefits “as
    set out in the spreadsheets of Sandra Guest-Poulin”.  ING argues that these
    directions are improper because Ms. Guest-Poulin was not personally qualified
    to provide evidence of Ms. Monks’ future needs and her report and spreadsheets
    were tendered at trial only on the issue of aggravated damages.  I would
    not give effect to this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Guest-Poulin’s expertise as a life care planning and rehabilitation expert
    was not challenged by ING at trial.  Nor does it appear that there was any
    suggestion that her spreadsheets should be excluded from evidence on the
    ground that she was not qualified to provide evidence of Ms. Monks’ current
    and future needs, notwithstanding that ING objected to their admission on
    other grounds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, Ms. Guest-Poulin testified that the information contained in her
    report and spreadsheets concerning Ms. Monks’ care requirements was provided
    by Ms. Monks, who is an experienced registered nurse and rehabilitation consultant
    in her own right, and by Ms. Monks’ medical and other careproviders, who
    testified at trial and were subject to cross-examination.  According to Ms.
    Guest-Poulin, her report and spreadsheets were a compilation of information
    from these sources designed to serve as a “tool” to assist the court in understanding
    Ms. Monks’ care requirements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this context, Ms. Guest-Poulin’s report and accompanying spreadsheets identified
    the categories or types of services that Ms. Monks required during the period
    2002-04 and at the time of trial in 2005, given her condition and care requirements
    as determined by her professional caregivers.  The spreadsheets also estimated
    the cost of such services, if undertaken in the future.  In particular, Ms.
    Guest-Poulin’s Life Care Plan 2005 detailed the types of projected services
    that Ms. Monks would require (based on her existing needs), the purpose of
    each service, the healthcare professional or other service provider who recommended
    the service in question, and the estimated cost and source of funding for
    each service identified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his exchanges with counsel regarding the admissibility of this evidence,
    the trial judge indicated, as he did in his ruling at the outset of trial
    concerning the admission of “needs” evidence, that he was concerned strictly
    with Ms. Monks’ existing rather than potential needs.  He said, “I want to
    look at current [needs], I don’t want to go beyond current … I can make my
    order based on the current needs…”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    transcript reveals that Ms. Guest-Poulin’s spreadsheets were ultimately admitted
    for two purposes: to support Ms. Monks’
    aggravated damages claim and to meet ING’s assertion – discussed later in
    these reasons – that ING should not be required to pay any further benefits
    until all the Zurich Settlement funds had first been exhausted.  The spreadsheets
    were intended, therefore, at least in part, to establish that the services
    in question were reasonable and necessary notwithstanding ING’s position
    to the contrary and the services already being provided by virtue of the
    Zurich Settlement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons indicate that he understood these purposes of Ms. Guest-Poulin’s
    report and spreadsheets.  As I have said, he explicitly stated that this
    evidence was relevant to Ms. Monks’ <i>“current”</i> needs and elaborated: “because
    for the most part they are recurring and known, they fit within the definition
    of ‘incurred’” (at para. 1125).  He then referred to his earlier ruling regarding
    the admissibility of evidence about Ms. Monks’ past and future needs, which
    I have mentioned above, and in a clear reference to <i>Coombe</i>, <i>supra</i> stated
    (at paras. 1125-26):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I also decided that the material that is being supplied
    to Ms. Monks, to meet such needs, is reasonable and necessary.  The plaintiff
    should definitely not be obliged to come to court every other month for a
    determination of what is reasonable and necessary.  If
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ms. Monks’ needs do change and the material required to look after the needs
    also changes, then a court application must be made.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I declare that the defendant is obliged to meet
    Ms. Monks’ needs on an ongoing basis as, presently, they are recurring needs.  The
    defendant has only to consult the spreadsheets found in Ms. Guest-Poulin’s
    report to know what is to be provided, on a monthly basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I read the trial judge’s reasons, therefore, he had regard to Ms. Guest-Poulin’s
    report and accompanying spreadsheets to determine the categories of services
    that Ms. Monks would require going forward, based on the evidence of her
    existing care requirements at the time of trial.  He recognized that these
    requirements might change, in which event ING would be free to challenge
    Ms. Monks’ entitlement to the services in question.  Importantly, he did
    not rely on Ms. Guest-Poulin’s costs estimates for the purpose of the declarations
    that he granted. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Understandably,
    the parties’ final written submissions at trial specifically addressed the
    categories of expenditures that were in dispute.  ING was thus provided with
    a full opportunity to contest, and did contest, the asserted necessity and
    reason-ableness of the services claimed by Ms. Monks.  In addition, ING’s
    trial counsel appears to have acknowledged at one point during the trial
    that Ms. Guest-Poulin’s evidence could ground a declaration of Ms. Monks’ entitlement
    to the services enumerated in Ms. Guest-Poulin’s report and spreadsheets.  She
    said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There may be some which you will make your ruling
    on in terms of whether or not you feel that it’s something that she is entitled
    to.  And then, once you’ve made your ruling on that particular aspect of
    it, that’s decided one way or another in terms of any future claim for that
    particular item.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, I do not agree that the trial judge erred in his
    treatment of Ms. Guest-Poulin’s report and spreadsheets.  The trial judge
    relied on this evidence, together with the evidence of Ms. Monks’ caregivers
    and Ms. Monks herself, to determine her benefits requirements current to
    the time of trial and, based on them, her anticipated ongoing benefits requirements.  He
    crafted the declarations in question to ensure that the quantum of any particular
    future benefits claim remained to be determined in accordance with the SABS
    and to preserve ING’s right to seek to establish that a benefit claimed in
    the future was no longer reasonable and necessary.  I see nothing objectionable
    in this approach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    end my consideration of this ground of appeal where I began.  As I have indicated,
    ING argued at the end of trial that if a declaration was granted regarding
    Ms. Monks’
    entitlement to ongoing benefits, the relief allowed should be limited to
    a declaration of entitlement, without any determination of the amount of
    the benefits in question.  That is precisely what the trial judge did.</p>
  <h2><i>The Judicial Bias Issue</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING’s
    assertion of judicial bias is focused on the trial judge’s reasons.  There
    is no suggestion that the trial judge’s conduct deprived ING of adjudicative
    fairness during the trial itself.  ING’s four complaints in support of its
    bias claim are succinctly described in para. 65 of its factum on appeal: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ING respectfully submits that a combination of errors
    and comments exhibiting bias when taken in totality ought to result in a
    new trial.  The learned trial judge made a number of material errors in his
    understanding of the evidence; he failed to grasp the theory of the defence;
    His Honour made comments exhibiting a bias against ING, its witnesses and
    its counsel and his treatment of the evidence of Sandra Guest-Poulin resulted
    in a denial of natural justice.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;'>ING made similar oral submissions
    before this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    faces a significant hurdle to succeed on this ground of appeal.  The threshold
    for a finding of actual or apprehended judicial bias is a high one, “requiring
    cogent and substantial evidence that the judge has done something giving
    rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias”: <i>Hungary v. Horvath</i> (2007),
    230 O.A.C. 66 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    and <i>R. v. S. (R.D.)</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.).  The courts

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING’s
    first complaint is that the trial judge “made a number of material errors
    in his understanding of the evidence”.  Having reviewed the findings said
    to reflect these legal errors and the evidence relevant to those findings,
    it is my view that they are either not errors at all or they are so minor
    when viewed in the context of the critical issues at this complex and lengthy
    trial as to be inconsequential.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    examples suffice to make this point.  Of the factual errors alleged by ING,
    the most serious involve the trial judge’s finding concerning Dr. Besemann’s
    neutrality in the conduct of his assessment of Ms. Monks and his finding
    that Drs. Hansebout and Besemann testified at trial on the key issue of causation
    beyond the bounds of the opinions detailed in their reports.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    Dr. Besemann.  The trial judge stated that Dr. Besemann acknowledged that
    his neutrality had been compromised due to his failure to adhere to impartiality
    guidelines applicable to designated assessment centre assessors.  During
    a searching cross-examination at trial, Dr. Besemann acknowledged his awareness
    of and support for the neutrality provisions of the guidelines, including
    the requirement that communi-cations with assessors – like Dr. Besemann – involve
    all parties to an assessment.  But he also confirmed that he had met with
    ING’s trial counsel to prepare for trial, without the knowledge or involvement
    of Ms. Monks’ counsel.  Further, he was confronted at trial with the fact
    that, unbeknownst to Ms. Monks’ counsel, he had received documentation from
    ING’s counsel after the date of his assessment that included “insurance” and “legal” files.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    this evidence, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that Dr. Besemann’s
    testimony on cross-examination included an implicit acknowledgment that the
    neutrality provisions of the guidelines were breached.  Even if the trial
    judge erred in his appreciation of whether Dr. Besemann actually acknowledged
    such a breach, this error is of little moment.  The admissions made by Dr.
    Besemann, objectively viewed, supported the trial judge’s finding that such
    a breach occurred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the suggestion of ‘over-reaching’ by Drs. Hansebout and Besemann.  The trial
    judge held that Drs. Hansebout’s and Besemann’s opinions on causation as
    offered at trial went beyond those expressed by them in their written reports.  I
    see no palpable let alone overriding error by the trial judge in respect
    of this factual finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to Dr. Hansebout, the trial judge stated that he gave no indication
    in his report that Ms. Monks required corrective spinal surgery <i>before</i> the
    third accident, although he offered the opinion at trial that surgery was
    necessary before the third accident due to the natural progression of Ms.
    Monks’ spinal disease.  ING submits that this reflects a critical misapprehension
    by the trial judge of Dr. Hansebout’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  On more than one occasion during his trial testimony, Dr. Hansebout
    said that Ms. Monks required surgery before the third accident.  In its final
    written argument at trial, ING expressly relied on this evidence.  The trial
    judge was correct that this opinion was not clearly expressed in Dr. Hansebout’s
    written report.  Instead, Dr. Hansebout stated in his report that Ms. Monks “would
    have required surgery even had she not been involved in the 1998 motor vehicle
    accident”.  This language left open the important issue of when the surgery
    would have been necessary.  To this extent, therefore, Dr. Hansebout ‘went
    beyond’ the opinions expressed in his report when testifying at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    the trial judge noted that Dr. Besemann expressed uncertainty in his report
    about whether Ms. Monks had sustained a spinal cord injury in the third accident.  However,
    until objection by Ms. Monks’
    counsel, Dr. Besemann attempted to testify at trial that he was certain that
    there had been no spinal cord injury occasioned by that accident.  Again,
    the trial judge’s finding was grounded in the evidence and events at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s findings concerning the evidence of Drs. Hansebout and
    Besemann must be placed in context.  The record before this court supports
    the trial judge’s observation that ING’s trial counsel led “many new points
    at trial” and that Drs. Hansebout’s and Besemann’s trial testimony, at least
    in some respects, went beyond the matters outlined in their reports.  More
    importantly, apart from this factor, the trial judge outlined many other
    considerations concerning these witnesses’
    evidence that amply justified his rejection of their opinions on causation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING’s
    second complaint concerning judicial bias involves the contention that the
    trial judge misapprehended the defence theory on causation.  ING submits
    that the trial judge erred by concluding that the defence theory turned on
    the premise that Ms. Monks required corrective spinal surgery prior to the
    third accident when, in fact, it was ING’s position that Ms. Monks would
    have required surgery at some point, regardless of the occurrence of the
    third accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    I disagree.  In his reasons, the trial judge quoted extensively, and verbatim,
    from ING’s final written argument at trial on causation.  That argument clearly
    states that ING’s primary position on causation was that Ms. Monks needed
    surgery prior to the third accident.  Only in the alternative did ING argue
    that Ms. Monks’ condition would have progressed to the point of necessitating
    corrective surgery regardless of the third accident.  The trial judge’s reasons
    reveal that he was mindful of both planks of the defence theory on causation.  His
    rejection of ING’s position on the timing of the need for surgery cannot
    ground a claim of judicial bias.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons also include a detailed review of the evidence concerning
    the timing of Ms. Monks’ need for surgery.  Dr. Hansebout’s and Dr. Stewart’s
    opinions on this issue directly conflicted with that of Dr. Lesiuk.  The
    timing of the need for surgery was one of the key causation-related issues
    at trial.  In the end, as he was entitled to do, the trial judge simply preferred
    Dr. Lesiuk’s opinion that, before the third  accident, Ms. Monks was in the
    60% category of patients who could remain stable if nothing further untoward
    occurred and that the clear need for surgery did not arise until after the
    third accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING’s
    third complaint is that certain of the trial judge’s comments and findings
    about ING’s conduct in responding to Ms. Monks’ benefits claims and its conduct
    of the trial reflect judicial bias.  I am unable to accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    challenged remarks and findings by the trial judge fall into three categories:
    (i) comments that quote directly from ING’s final trial argument; (ii) observations
    and findings concerning the evidence of the defence experts and Dr. Besemann;
    and (iii) comments and findings that form part of the trial judge’s analysis
    of Ms. Monks’ aggravated damages claim.  I see nothing inappropriate in the
    challenged references in any of these categories.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    can be no serious objection to the trial judge’s references to ING’s final
    written argument at trial.  The fact that the trial judge concluded that
    parts of that argument were not supported by the evidence, or were otherwise
    to be rejected, does not render his mention of them improper.  As I have
    already said, his disagreement with the submissions advanced by ING does
    not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    recognize that the trial judge used blunt and sometimes harsh language to
    express some of his findings about the evidence of the defence experts and
    Dr. Besemann and ING’s conduct both prior to and at trial.  But this was
    a lengthy, complex and hard-fought trial that involved conflicting expert
    evidence on the core issue of causation.  In this context, the trial judge
    is to be afforded some latitude on the manner in which his findings were
    expressed.  This is particularly so, in my view, where – as here – many of
    the challenged comments and findings concern the trial judge’s evaluation
    of the credibility and impartiality of the expert witnesses, the usefulness
    of their evidence to his decision-making process, and his appreciation of
    the evidence as a whole.  These are matters squarely within the trial judge’s
    domain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    some of the impugned comments and findings relate to the adequacy, timeliness
    and reasonableness of ING’s response to Ms. Monks’ benefits claims and its
    decisions to terminate benefits payments and to seek partial reimbursement
    of benefits already paid.  These were the issues underlying Ms. Monks’
    allegations that ING’s conduct constituted a wanton disregard of her rights
    and a breach by ING of its duty of good faith, thereby justifying an award
    of aggravated damages.  To the extent that the trial judge’s comments and
    findings on these issues reveal a negative view of ING’s conduct, his criticisms
    were reasonably supported by the record.  They do not constitute judicial
    bias but, rather, his assessment of the facts supporting an aggravated damages
    award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    ING complains that the trial judge’s treatment of Ms. Guest-Poulin’s report
    and spreadsheets supports a claim of judicial bias.  As I have said, it is
    my view that the trial judge’s use of this evidence was permissible in the
    circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Overall,
    I am satisfied that the passages from the trial judge’s reasons relied on
    by ING, viewed individually or in combination, do not amount to judicial
    bias.  Given the issues in play and the positions of the parties on those
    issues at trial, I am of the view that a reasonably informed person, reading
    the trial judge’s reasons as a whole in light of the trial record, would
    conclude that the trial judge demonstrated no actual or apprehended bias.  I
    would therefore reject this ground of appeal.</p>

    Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    clarified the exceptions to the “but for” causation test and the circum-stances

    for Ms. Monks argued at trial that causation would be established in respect
    of the third accident if Ms. Monks demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities,
    that this accident contributed to her injuries in a manner that was outside
    the <i>de minimis</i> range.  The trial judge agreed and found that the material
    contribution test for causation was satisfied despite Ms. Monk’s two prior
    accidents and her pre-existing spinal condition.  ING acknowledged in its
    factum on appeal that “the record discloses a reasonable body of evidence
    that would permit a properly instructed trier of fact to so conclude”.  However,
    it submits that the trial judge erred in his causation analysis by applying
    the material contribution test to determine causation.   </p>

    disagree.  ING’s effort to now disclaim the application of the material contri-bution
    test in accident benefits cases is completely inconsistent with its position
    at trial on causation.  In ING’s final written argument at trial, it submitted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The case law relating to accident benefit claims
    is clear – that the principles enunciated in the Supreme Court of Canada
    decision of <i>Athey</i> are equally applicable in the context of an accident

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    in its written argument, ING stated even more bluntly: “[T]he Plaintiff must
    meet the burden of establishing that the [third] accident <i>significantly
    contributed to the severity or duration</i> of the Plaintiff’s symptoms” [emphasis
    in original] and, further: “The test incorporates a requirement that the
    Plaintiff prove that the contribution of the [third] accident is <i>significant
    or material to the development or continuation of the disability claimed</i>.”  [Emphasis

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    thus invoked and urged the adoption of the material contribution test, ING

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s application of the material contribution test conforms

    any event, I agree with Ms. Monks’ submission that the evidence of Dr. Lesiuk
    could have grounded the application of the “but for” causation test as well
    as the material contribution test and that, if the former test had been applied,
    the outcome would have been the same.  Dr. Lesiuk, for example, testified
    that: “[T]he ultimate outcome of the things that happened to her had the
    potential to be different had this accident not occurred.  And the outcome
    of everything that happened if the accident had not occurred could not be
    reliably predicted to be the same.”  I am satisfied that the evidence and
    the trial judge’s reasoning and findings support his conclusions on the basis
    of a
    “but for” analysis.</p>

    also submits that the trial judge erred in his causation analysis by concluding
    that the “crumbling skull” principle discussed in <i>Athey</i> has no application
    to accident benefits cases.  This principle recognizes that a defendant tortfeasor
    need not put a tort victim in a position better than his or her original
    position.  As Major J. put it in <i>Athey</i> at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span

    for those injuries caused by our accident, being a cervical strain”, which
    expenses had already been paid.  The trial judge rejected this argument,
    holding at para. 852: “[T]here is no room for the crumbling skull theory
    in accident benefit cases.”  </p>

    agree.  There is no indication in the SABS of a legislative intent that an
    insurer’s liability for the accident benefits in issue in this case should
    be subject to discount for apportionment of causation due to an insured’s
    pre-existing injuries caused by an unrelated accident.  The SABS simply states,
    in clear and unambiguous language, that an insurer “shall pay an insured
    person who sustains an impairment as a result of an accident” medical, rehabilitation
    and attendant care benefits (ss. 14(1), 15(1) and 16(1)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    where – as here – a benefits claimant’s impairment is shown on the “but for” or
    material contribution causation tests to have resulted from an accident in
    respect of which the claimant is insured, the insurer’s liability for accident
    benefits is engaged in accordance with the provisions of the SABS.  </p>

    if the crumbling skull principle could be said to apply to accident benefits
    cases, its application would not be triggered here.  As I have said, the
    trial judge accepted Dr. Lesiuk’s evidence that, prior to the third accident,
    there was a 60% chance that Ms. Monks’ condition could have remained stable.  There
    was no finding by the trial judge that the incomplete quadriplegia to which
    Ms. Monks eventually succumbed would have occurred at some point without
    the third accident, which would have engaged the crumbling skull principle.  See <i>Athey</i> at

    reliance on s. 60(2), ING argues, as it did at trial, that: (i) it ought
    not to be required to pay any benefits to Ms. Monks until the Zurich Settlement
    monies are exhausted in full; (ii) the maximum funds available to Ms. Monks
    are equal to a single policy limit for the accident benefit in question;
    and (iii) it ought to receive “credit” for the whole amount of the Zurich
    Settlement funds because these proceeds were “reasonably available” to Ms.

    trial, Ms. Monks responsibly acknowledged that she was not entitled to double
    recovery or a windfall in respect of the accident benefits that she claimed.  At
    the same time, it was her position that she was entitled to receive immediately
    the applicable accident benefits under her ING policy, for which she had
    paid a separate premium, with-out being required to first exhaust the Zurich
    Settlement funds.  She proposed, therefore, that the monthly amounts to be
    paid to her from the proceeds of the Zurich Settlement on account of medical,
    rehabilitation, attendant care and housekeeping expenses should be deducted
    from any monthly amounts to be paid to her by ING in connection with the
    third accident, on account of the same categories of benefits.  She further
    proposed that the funds she received under the Zurich Settlement for home
    renovations ($75,000) be used to either renovate her home or purchase another
    and that the balance of the funds required be funded by ING.</p>

    unrea-sonable or incorrect in the plaintiff’s plan to account for the
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    required to wait until the funds under the Zurich Settlement were exhausted
    before receiving benefits payments from ING (para. 1112); (ii) s. 60(2) of
    the SABS did not apply in this case (para. 1115); and (iii) Ms. Monks was
    entitled to the coverage afforded by both the Zurich and ING policies: “Both

    be “net of collateral benefits and what the Plaintiff receives from the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Zurich settlement funds”.  Similarly, in respect of ongoing housekeeping

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no basis for interference with the trial judge’s treatment of the Zurich
    Settlement funds.  In my view, his acceptance of Ms. Monks’
    proposals was reasonable and his interpretation of s. 60(2) of the SABS was
    correct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the language of s. 60(2) of the SABS that exempts an insurer
    from paying accident benefits where the insured is positioned to claim the
    same type of benefits from another insurer for injuries arising from a different
    accident.  Section 60(2) contemplates that an insurer need not pay that portion
    of
    “an expense” for which payment is “reasonably available” under another insurance
    plan.  This language is designed to prevent recovery from two insurers for
    the same expense.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    s. 60(2) makes no mention of an insured’s pre-existing impairment arising
    from a prior accident.  In contrast, s. 60(1) authorizes an insurer to deduct
    benefits being received by an insured “in respect of an impairment that occurred
    before the accident” from the amount payable to an insured as an income replacement
    benefit after the accident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    in respect of income replacement benefits, funds payable from another insurer
    for injuries sustained in another accident are deductible.  No such provision
    is contained in s. 60(2) of the SABS in respect of medical, rehabilitation
    or attendant care benefits.  In accordance with well-established principles
    of statutory interpretation, the absence of such language in s. 60(2) signals
    a legislative intent that an insurer’s liability for the accident benefits
    in issue in this case is not subject to reduction on account of benefits
    paid for an insured’s injuries in another accident.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Zurich policy and that ING was also her insurer in respect of the third accident
    is irrelevant to Ms. Monks’ right to recover accident benefits from both
    companies.  That Zurich and ING became, in effect, the same payor for the
    purpose of Ms. Monks’ benefits claims by virtue of the transaction between
    Zurich and ING does not change the fact that Ms. Monks purchased two separate
    insurance policies, paid premiums on each policy, was afforded coverage under
    both policies and each policy responded to a different accident.  I agree
    with the trial judge that Ms. Monks is entitled to look to both insurers
    for payment of those accident benefits to which she is entitled in accordance
    with the statutory accident benefits regimes in place when each accident
    occurred.</p>

    Zurich Settlement, on

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Zurich’s account, in each benefit category.  I therefore agree with Ms. Monks’ submission
    that the effect of the declarations in issue, as crafted, is to recognize
    that the limits under both policies are fully available to satisfy proper
    benefits claims by Ms. Monks, subject to the restriction that they cannot
    be drawn down in respect of the same expenditure.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Zurich Settlement was entered into on April 22, 2002.  By that time, ING
    had acquired

    addition, the evidence at trial indicates that, by at least November 27,

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    structured settlement ensured that Ms. Monks would receive funds in certain
    benefits categories until she dies.  As the trial judge recognized, the effect
    of ING’s argument that it should not be required to pay benefits until the
    Zurich Settlement funds have been expended in full is that it would never
    have to pay benefits, for which it is otherwise liable, in at least those
    benefits categories contemplated by the structured settlement.  This result,
    in my view, would be unjust and would not accord with the scheme of the SABS
    or the terms of Ms. Monks’
    contract of insurance with ING.</p>

    contrary to ING’s contention, can the structured settlement be regarded as
    manipulation of the Zurich Settlement funds to the prejudice of ING.   If
    the effect of a structured settlement was regarded this way, so as to reduce
    or indefinitely defer an insurer’s benefits payment obligations, a significant
    chilling effect on the willingness of accident victims to enter into structured
    settlements would be occasioned, thus vitiating the salutary effects of such
    settlements.  </p>

  <h2><i>The Aggravated Damages Issue</i></h2>

    challenges the trial judge’s award of aggravated damages on the sole ground
    that there is no basis in the evidence for such an award.  In support of
    this argument, it relies on all its submissions on appeal, especially those
    relating to the allegation of judicial bias.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was ample evidentiary support for the award of aggravated damages in this
    case.  In the course of his damages assessment, the trial judge made the
    following findings: (i) ING did not look after Ms. Monks’ needs properly
    from August to December 2000, even when her cognitive powers were diminished
    and she was in a depressive state; (ii) some care recommendations made for
    Ms. Monks were not carried forward by ING; (iii) in other instances, ING’s
    delay in implementing care measures, <i>i.e.</i> home improve-ments, caused
    Ms. Monks physical and emotional damage; (iv) ING’s sudden termination of
    Ms. Monks’ benefits after the Zurich Settlement and its demand for reimbursement
    of approximately $52,600 on account of benefits already paid caused stress
    and damage to Ms. Monks and exacted a high toll on her physical and mental
    health; (vi) at about the same time, ING reduced Ms. Monks’ monthly income
    replacement benefits by 20% to offset the alleged overpayments made to Ms.
    Monks; and (vii) the funds paid to Ms. Monks in respect of needed expenditures
    prior to May 2002, when benefits were cut-off, were “the bare minimum”.  These
    findings, which were open to the trial judge on the evidence, are sufficient
    to support his award of aggravated damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    add one final point.  The trial judge indicated that he would have awarded
    $100,000 on account of aggravated damages but for some delay on Ms. Monks’ part
    in renovating her home or choosing to move to another home.  The trial judge
    reduced the damages awarded by 50% on account of this factor.  In these circumstances,
    in my view, the award of aggravated damages was both reasonable and arguably
    modest.</p>
  <h2><i>The Risk Premium Issue</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his ruling on costs dated September 8, 2005, the trial judge allowed a $75,000
    premium to Ms. Monks’ counsel, in addition to the costs awarded to Ms. Monks,
    on account of the risk assumed by counsel in undertaking this case.  At the
    time of this ruling, the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Walker
    v. Ritchie</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 428 and of this court in <i>The Manufacturers
    Life Insurance Co. v. Ward</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4882 were not available.  Those
    cases hold that a risk premium may not be passed on to an unsuccessful defendant
    as part of a costs award under Ontario’s <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> as
    in force today (<i>Manufacturers Life</i>) and at the time costs were fixed
    in this case (<i>Walker</i>).  Accordingly, the $75,000 risk premium awarded
    by the trial judge cannot stand.</p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I would allow the appeal in part, by setting aside the
    $75,000 risk premium awarded by the trial judge.  In all other respects,
    I would dismiss the appeal.  As Ms. Monks has been almost entirely successful
    on appeal, she is entitled to some costs of the appeal on the partial indemnity
    scale.  I would fix those costs in the amount of $35,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>

    declarations that Ms. Monks suffered a catastrophic impairment as a result
    of the third accident and that she is entitled to receive from ING the statutory
    accident benefits that a cata-strophically impaired person is entitled to
    receive under the SABS.  In its factum on appeal, ING challenged the declarations
    granted by the trial judge regarding both past and ongoing accident benefits.  However,
    during oral argument, it clarified that the declarations in issue are those
    that pertain to Ms. Monks’ future, that is, ongoing accident benefits.  In
    the result, as ultimately argued on appeal, ING does not dispute the relief
    granted by the trial judge concerning income replacement benefits and <i>past</i> medical,
    rehabilitation and attendant care benefits.</p>
