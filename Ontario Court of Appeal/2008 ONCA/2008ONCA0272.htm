    appeal concerns the liability of the respondent insurer, Lombard, under a
    Commercial General Liability Policy, to indemnify condominium unit owners
    for extensive damage caused to the foundation of their building by the negligence
    of the insured general contractor, Bradsil Leaseholds Ltd.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Bradsil
    first damaged the aquifer below the building during the initial excavation,
    then negligently made the repair. Several years later, the garage sank and
    the entire building had to be evacuated for months in order to properly repair
    the foundation supporting the building. The condominium owners and others
    with subrogated claims successfully sued Bradsil for the damages caused by
    its negligence and in 1996 obtained summary judgment for an amount in excess
    of the policy limits. As Bradsil could not satisfy the judgment and Lombard
    had denied coverage throughout, the owners then sued
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard under s.132 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, for
    recovery up to the policy limits.</p>

    response to the respondents’ summary judgment motion, the appellant asked
    the motion judge to dismiss the action. The motion judge found that the condominium
    owners’ claim was covered by the policy and awarded summary judgment against
    <st1:place

    Lombard. I agree with the motion judge and would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    part of its contractual responsibilities, Bradsil was to follow the recommendations
    of a geo-technical consultant which included the directive that excavations
    not breach the aquitard, a layer of soil composed of clay that prevents the
    waters of the aquifer below from permeating up into the layer of soil containing
    the foundation of the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bradsil
    and its subcontractors failed to follow this directive and punctured the
    aquitard during their initial excavations, causing the waters of the aquifer
    to rise to the level of the foundation’s raft footings and concrete plugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agreed that it was Bradsil’s responsibility, to install a dewatering
    system to rectify this situation. Bradsil accordingly hired experts who competently
    designed a dewatering system that would have solved the problem without removing
    the soil supporting the condominium.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    Bradsil’s subcontractors failed to install the system in accordance with
    the experts’ designs. The subcontractors failed to ensure that the filter
    blanket beneath the building was continuous so as to avoid loss of soil,
    and failed to ensure that the sump pumps were equipped with bases or filters
    to prevent them from pumping away soil along with water. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    unbeknownst to anyone, the defective dewatering system pumped away silt and
    sand from beneath the condominium from 1989 until the defect was discovered
    in 1995. At that point, someone noticed that part of the condominium’s garage
    was sinking. Further investigation revealed that the removal of soil created
    large voids beneath the building which left the column footings underpinning
    the garage hanging in the air without soil support, and had caused damage
    to other parts of the foundation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the condominium residents were subject to an evacuation order for
    several months. The condominium owners had to borrow funds from the Regional
    Municipality of York and the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Richmond Hill to pay the $7.26 million required to fill the voids and lower
    the water level, as well as to repair the building foundations.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the large voids caused damage to the original foundations, which the respondents
    had to pay to repair, the motion judge found that the construction of the
    original foundations themselves was not defective. Rather, the foundations
    were gradually damaged as a result of the voids produced by the faulty installation
    of the dewatering system, which was aimed at correcting Bradsil’s first error
    in excavating beyond the aquitard soil layer.</p>

    rise to Bradsil’s liability fell within the period and territory covered

'>(1)       Did the damages awarded against Bradsil constitute compensation for

    product?</p>
  <p align=left style='

    the meaning of Bradsil’s CGL policy?</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue
      1: Was the damage third party property damage or damage to Bradsil’s own
      work?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first issue, the appellant argues that the correct way to view the respondents’ claim
    against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard is as a claim for damages to compensate for Bradsil’s poor workmanship
    in the installation of the defective dewatering system that resulted in the
    damage to the foundation of the building, which was Bradsil’s work product
    itself. The appellant argues that the claim therefore treats the CGL policy
    as a performance bond rather than as insurance against damage to the property
    of third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for the appellant’s position is its characterization of the “foundation” under
    the building as part of Bradsil’s work. The trial judge correctly rejected
    this characterization. I believe that part of the appellant’s argument stems
    from confusion over the dual meaning of the term “foundation”. In relation
    to a building, the foundation can refer either to the structural components
    constructed by the contractor that anchor the building: the “constructed
    foundation”, or to the compacted soil, earth or rock that forms the natural
    base upon which the building is erected: the “natural foundation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    major consequence of Bradsil’s faulty workmanship was that the dewatering
    system removed not only water but also silt and soil from under the constructed
    foundation, thereby removing the building’s natural foundation and leaving
    the footings that supported the garage hanging in a void. The natural foundation
    is the land beneath the building and is part of the property of the third
    party owners of the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    consequence of the defective dewatering system was that as the earth beneath
    the building was washed away over time, the structural columns that formed
    part of the constructed foundation were damaged by the erosion. The motion
    judge found that these structural components were not defective when they
    were constructed. Therefore, Bradsil’s faulty workmanship also damaged part
    of the constructed foundation, however that foundation had by then become
    part of the third party property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is governed by this court’s decision in <i>Alie v. Bertrand &amp; Frere
    Construction Co.</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 345. Bertrand had supplied defective
    ready-mix concrete for the construction of the foundations of a number of
    homes. The defect was in the fly-ash component of the ready- mix which had
    been supplied by Lafarge. Eventually the concrete failed and both the foundations
    of the homes that had been constructed using the ready mix that had been
    formed into concrete, as well as the homes themselves suffered structural
    damage; also, remediation was required to prevent future damage. The insurers
    of Bertrand and Lafarge argued that the damage caused to the foundations
    of the homes was damage to the product supplied by Lafarge and Bertrand,
    that is, it was damage to their own work and was therefore not covered by
    their CGL policies. The court rejected the insurers’ position. Although the
    CGL policies would not pay for the portion of the damage referable to the
    cost of the concrete itself, the other damage, including all of the other
    costs involved in remediating and replacing the damaged foundations, was
    damage to the homes of the third party homeowners and was therefore covered
    by the CGL policies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court had no trouble disposing of the insurers’
    arguments in <i>Alie</i>. At para. 35, the court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In our view,
    little would be gained in reviewing the submissions of counsel on the relevant
    caselaw. The principle that a CGL policy is not intended to cover the insured’s
    own defective product or work is well-established and not disputed in this
    case. It is its application that is in issue. The ultimate determination
    of whether the damage was to the insured’s own product, or to the property
    of a third party, is largely a question of fact…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as in <i>Alie,</i> the motion judge determined that the damage
    caused by the defective dewatering system to the natural foundation underneath
    the building as well as to the foundational columns was damage to third party
    property for which the appellant is responsible under Bradsil’s CGL policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Alie,</i> the
    insurers also sought to rely, as the appellant does in this case, on the
    Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>Winnipeg Condominium Corp. No. 35
    v. Bird Construction Co.</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85, for the proposition that
    one cannot artificially differentiate between different components of the
    structure to say that one defective component caused damage to the rest – instead
    the entire structure must be treated as a single unit. In <i>Alie,</i> this
    court at para. 45 rejected the insurer’s argument, explaining that in <i>Winnipeg
    Condominium</i>, the Supreme Court </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>has simply rejected,
    as unhelpful, any artificial characterization of the nature of the loss as
    the basis for determining the extent of tortious liability. The court favoured
    a more principled approach based on relevant policy considerations. Further,
    the rejection of the complex structure theory does not assist the insurers.
    Their argument on this point still rests on the assumption that the defective
    foundations are Bertrand’s product and that they constitute the entirety
    of the loss. As we have stated earlier, it is our view that the trial judge’s
    finding that the damage went beyond Bertrand’s ready-mix concrete is supported
    on the evidence. (para. 45)</p>

    damage is only compensable under the policy if it was caused by an “occurrence” which
    is defined as: “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to
    the same general harmful conditions.”</p>

    appellant argues that the damage was caused by Bradsil’s negligence and that
    an event caused by negligence cannot be an accident, relying on the 1964
    Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in <i>Marshall Wells of Canada Ltd. v.
    Winnipeg Supply &amp; Fuel Co.</i> [1964] 49 W.W.R. 664. However, as the
    motion judge stated in her reasons, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected
    that holding in 1975 in <i>Canadian Indemnity Co. v. Walkem Machinery &amp; Equipment
    Ltd.,</i> (1975) 53 D.L.R. (3d) 1 at 6-7, calling it
    “wholly erroneous”, preferring instead to characterize an accident as “any
    unlooked for mishap or occurrence”. The court specifically rejected the notion
    that a negligent act could not be an accident or that damage caused by negligence
    would not be compensable under a CGL insurance policy. </p>

    ) assist the appellant. That case held that errors in negligently manufacturing
    a product do not constitute an accident under a CGL policy and distinguished <i>Canadian
    Indemnity</i> on the basis that it involved compensation for damage to the
    property of a third party, rather than for the cost of repairing the negligently
    manufactured product itself.</p>

    damage in this case was caused by Bradsil’s negligent installation of the
    dewatering system which caused an “unlooked for mishap”, the destruction
    of the natural foundation of the building and the consequent damage to its
    structural integrity. In my view, the motion judge was correct in her conclusion
    that the damage was caused by an occurrence within the meaning of the CGL
    policy.</p>

    my view, the motion judge made no reversible error in finding that the damage
