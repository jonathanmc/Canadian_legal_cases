    appellant was charged with second degree murder and attempted murder.  Both
    charges arose out of an incident that occurred at the appellant’s home in
    the late evening hours of April 25, 2005.  Jason Joyce and Michael Kane went
    to the appellant’s home in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in search of drugs.  The appellant was a drug dealer.  A dispute
    broke out on the landing of the elevated deck leading to the door of the
    appellant’s home.  The appellant shot and killed Joyce.  The Crown contended
    that he also shot at, but missed, Kane.  The appellant did not testify at
    trial.  Through counsel, he argued that he shot Joyce in self-defence.  He
    also contended that he did not intend to kill Kane and that in any event
    he acted in self-defence when he fired a shot in Kane’s direction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury could not reach a verdict on the murder charge but convicted the appellant
    on the attempted murder charge.  He appeals his conviction and sentence.  The
    appellant’s re-trial on the murder charge is scheduled to begin next month.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this appeal, counsel concedes that the jury must have concluded that the
    appellant intended to kill Kane.  He accepts that the finding of intent to
    kill is untainted by any of the alleged errors in the trial judge’s instructions
    and must be accepted for the purpose of his arguments on appeal.  Counsel
    further accepts that assuming the appellant intended to kill Kane, s. 37
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides the only statutory basis for the self-defence
    claim.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that the jury must have been satisfied that the appellant intended
    to kill Kane and that his self-defence claim stands or falls on s. 37.  We
    also agree with counsel’s submissions that the self-defence instruction on
    attempted murder was inadequate and necessitates the quashing of the conviction.  Given
    that result, we do not propose to review the evidence in detail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    Kane and Joyce went to the appellant’s home in search of drugs, Joyce and
    the appellant had a heated conversation on the telephone.  When Kane and
    Joyce arrived at the appellant’s home, he refused to let them in.  Joyce
    was standing at the door and Kane was standing off to one side apparently
    out of the appellant’s sightlines.  Joyce and the appellant argued at the
    door.  Joyce was a very large man who was quite capable of acts of violence.  He
    had a criminal record.  When Joyce tried to gain entry to the appellant’s
    home, the appellant retrieved a baseball bat.  Joyce made it clear that a
    baseball bat would not stop him from entering the home.  He continued to
    try to kick the door down.  The appellant then retrieved a gun.  Joyce saw
    the gun and made a derisive comment towards the appellant.  He continued
    to kick at the door, eventually breaking the deadbolt and forcing the door
    open.  After the door opened, the appellant fired one shot striking Joyce
    in the chest.  Joyce turned towards Kane, said something and fell to the
    floor on the landing just outside the door.  This wound was fatal according
    to the medical testimony. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Seconds
    after Joyce was shot, Kane emerged from behind the door with a golf club
    in his hand. He was on the landing approximately ten feet away from the appellant.
    The appellant fired a second shot.  According to Kane, he had started away
    from the door towards the stairs when the appellant fired the second shot.  After
    Kane had fled down the stairs, the appellant fired three more shots into
    Joyce who was lying on the landing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming,
    as we must given the jury’s verdict, that the appellant fired at Kane intending
    to kill him, we are satisfied that there was an evidentiary basis for the
    defence of self-defence as it applied to the attempted murder charge.  The
    events between the firing of the first shot and the firing of the second
    shot occurred very quickly in a confined space, in chaotic circumstances
    and in relatively bad lighting.  Despite Kane’s evidence that he had headed
    down the stairs before the shot was fired, a jury could reasonably conclude
    that the appellant reasonably perceived that Kane was a party to Joyce’s
    efforts to forcibly gain entry to his house.  The jury could further conclude
    that the appellant reasonably perceived that Kane, who standing about ten
    feet away from him with a golf club in his hand, posed an immediate threat
    to cause grievous bodily harm to the appellant in the seconds immediately
    after the appellant shot Joyce.  If the jury took this view of the evidence
    or had a reasonable doubt on these issues, the defence of self-defence as
    set out in s. 37 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> could be available to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    concluding that there was an air of reality to the appellant’s self-defence
    claim as it applied to the attempted murder charge, we note that Crown counsel
    at trial did not suggest otherwise either in the pre-charge discussions or
    by way of objection to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  In those
    instructions, the trial judge left self-defence as an available defence to
    the attempted murder charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge dealt at some length with the defence of self-defence as it applied
    to the murder charge.  He made it clear to the jury that the defence was
    available even if the jury was satisfied that the appellant had the requisite
    intent for murder.  He effectively told the jury that an intentional killing
    was unlawful and therefore murder only if the Crown negated the defence of
    self-defence.  These instructions were embodied in a
    “decision tree” that the jury took into their deliberations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    on appeal have carefully taken us through the relevant passages from the
    trial judge’s instructions referable to the attempt murder charge (transcript
    vol. 15, pp. 76-83).  Unlike the murder charge, the trial judge did not deal
    separately with the application of the elements of self-defence to the charge
    of attempt murder.  We agree with counsel for the appellant’s submission
    that several passages in the instruction conflate the distinct issues of
    intent and self-defence as they relate to the attempt murder charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    parts of the trial judge’s instruction, he expressly told the jury that it
    had to convict the appellant on the attempt murder charge if the Crown had
    proved that he intended to kill Kane.  For example, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact that
    he missed Mr. Kane, that is up to you to decide.  <u>As long as you decide
    beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to kill him and he intended to
    kill him, you must convict of attempted murder with respect to Mr. Kane.</u>  If
    he attempted to shoot him but did not intend to kill him, then he is not
    guilty of attempted murder.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
    passages of the instructions do indicate that the defence of self-defence
    remains a live issue even if the appellant intended to kill Kane.  Unfortunately,
    these passages do not explain how the defence of self-defence applies should
    the jury be satisfied that the appellant intended to kill Kane.  For example,
    the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you can say
    beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to kill Mr. Kane and missed, as
    opposed to a warning shot, or scaring him off, or wounding him, if you can
    say that, then you can convict of attempted murder.  <u>And you will look
    at all of the evidence and on that evidence when you talk about self-defence,
    self-defence enters into it.</u>  You may have different considerations with
    self-defence with respect to Mr. Kane.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    appreciate, as stressed by Crown counsel, that the trial judge’s instructions
    must be considered as a whole.  Certainly, the passages quoted above cannot
    be considered in isolation.  They do, however, fairly reflect the confusion
    created by the instructions on the defence of self-defence as it applied
    to attempt murder.  Nowhere in those instructions did the trial judge make
    it clear to the jury how the defence of self-defence could be applied if
    the jury was satisfied that the appellant intended to kill Kane.  We are
    satisfied that the jury may well have been left either with the impression
    that self-defence was only relevant as part of the assessment of the appellant’s
    state of mind, or was entirely irrelevant if the jury was satisfied that
    the appellant had the necessary intent to kill.  Either impression is wrong
    in law and would have seriously prejudiced the appellant’s defence on the
    attempt murder charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    attempt murder “decision tree” could only have exacerbated the confusion
    created by the instructions.  Unlike the murder “decision tree”, the attempt
    murder “decision tree” does not present self-defence as a distinct issue
    that had to be addressed by the jury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    argument of this appeal, counsel for the Crown asked this court to provide
    whatever guidance it could to the trial judge, should this court order a
    new trial.  The difficulties inherent in self-defence instructions are well
    known.  We are anxious to provide whatever assistance we can to the judge
    who will preside over the new trial.  However, the self-defence instructions
    that should be provided in any given case depend on the entirety of the evidence
    and, to a lesser extent, the positions taken by the parties at trial.  There
    is no guarantee that the evidence on the re-trial will be the same as the
    evidence heard at the first trial.  Consequently, it can be unhelpful, if
    not downright dangerous, for this court to try to anticipate what self-defence
    instructions should be given on the re-trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the hope, however, that it may be of some assistance on the retrial, and
    assuming there are no material differences in the evidence heard on the re-trial,
    we make the following observations.  These observations apply to the application
    of the self-defence provisions to the murder and attempt murder charges.  If
    instructions on included offences are necessary, those instructions may raise
    their own self-defence issues:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant shot at
    Kane intending to kill him, s. 37 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is the only
    statutory provision in respect of the defence of self-defence that has any
    application on the attempt murder charge;  </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    34(2) and s. 37 are potentially applicable on the murder charge.  Whether
    both sections should be put to the jury depends on whether the defences as
    described in those sections completely overlap on the evidence adduced in
    the case.  If the overlap is complete, there is no need to put both sections; </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no need for a separate instruction under s. 37 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> based
    on the theory that the appellant was acting to protect his girlfriend who
    was in the house with him;  </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    41, the defence of property provision, cannot excuse an intentional killing
    or an attempt to kill.  In any event, the defence of property described in
    s. 41, is on the evidence heard at the trial, subsumed in the appellant’s
    self-defence claims.  There was no need for a separate s. 41 instruction.</p>
