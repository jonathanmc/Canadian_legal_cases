    appellant alleges that he was constructively dismissed by his employer without
    cause.  This appeal concerns the proper forum in which to litigate that claim.  The
    appellant submits that he is entitled to have his claim decided in the Superior
    Court.  The respondent asserts that the claim is within the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Ontario Labour Relations Board.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    fundamental principles frame this jurisdictional dispute.  On the one side
    stands the imperative that legislative pronouncements must be respected by
    the courts.  The legislature has put in place a comprehensive statutory scheme
    requiring employers and employees to take certain disputes to specialized
    tribunals where these disputes can be resolved in a timely, cost-effective
    way that minimizes the disruption in the workplace.  This scheme can only
    work if the courts, except when exercising their supervisory powers through
    judicial review, stay out of these disputes.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the other side of the jurisdictional dispute stands the individual’s right
    to access to justice.  Those individuals alleged to have been wronged in
    the context of the employer/employee relationship, but whose allegations
    are either not caught by the legislative scheme or cannot be remedied under
    that scheme must, like any other litigant, have access to the ordinary courts.  </p>

  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant sued his employer, Cintas Canada Limited (“Cintas”), in Superior
    Court for wrongful dismissal.  He claimed that Cintas had constructively
    dismissed him by substantially reducing his wages, increasing his workload,
    unilaterally altering other terms of his employment, and harassing him in
    the workplace.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cintas
    moved under rule 21.01(3)(a) to dismiss the action arguing that the appellant&rsquo;s
    complaint was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ontario Labour Relations
    Board (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). The motion judge accepted Cintas&rsquo; submission,
    held that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the wrongful dismissal claim,
    and struck the action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the appellant submits that his claim does not fall within the purview
    of the scheme created by the <i>Ontario Labour Relations Act</i>, S.O. 1995,
    c. 1 (the “<i>Act</i>”).  He submits that his claim does not give rise to
    any right of arbitration, since there was no collective agreement in effect,
    nor to any right to claim relief against Cintas before the Board pursuant
    to s. 96 of the <i>Act</i>.  Alternatively, the appellant submits that even
    if the <i>Act</i> can be read to give the Board jurisdiction over his complaints,
    he could not hope to obtain effective redress before the Board.  On the appellant’s
    submission, only the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union could properly take the complaints before the Board.  He contends that
    as the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union has been decertified, there is no reasonable prospect that it would
    pursue any complaint on his behalf.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  I accept Cintas’ submission that the appellant’s
    claim is in essence a claim that Cintas changed his working conditions unilaterally
    at a time when s. 86 of the <i>Act</i> prohibited Cintas from doing so.  Under
    the <i>Act</i>, the Board had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether
    Cintas had unilaterally changed the appellant’s working conditions and if
    so what remedy should be imposed against Cintas.   </p>

  <h4>THE FACTS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant commenced work for Cadet Uniform Services (“Cadet”) as a Sales
    Service Representative in May 1989.  Cintas purchased Cadet in February 1995.  Like
    Cadet before it, Cintas provided customized garment supply services and facility
    cleaning services through numerous stores across
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The appellant worked at Cintas’ plant on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    November 2003, the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 207 (the “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union”) applied to the Board for certification in respect of Cintas’
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Dundas Street operation.  Eventually, in September 2005, the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for all Cintas employees
    working at the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street location.  The appellant was in the bargaining unit described
    in the certification.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    September 2005, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union served notice on Cintas of its intention to commence negotiations towards
    a collective bargaining agreement.  The appellant served as one of the Union
    representatives on the bargaining committee.  Bargaining sessions were held
    in January 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    of June 12, 2006, the parties were unable to arrive at a collective bargaining
    agreement and a June 29 strike date was set.  On June 28, 2006, with the
    help of a mediator, the negotiators reached a tentative collective agreement.  On
    July 6, 2006, the employees voted against acceptance of the proposed agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    September 2006, a group of the employees filed an application with the Board
    to decertify the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union.  On September 29, 2006, following a vote by the members of the bargaining
    unit, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union was decertified.  No collective agreement was ever in effect at the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street operation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the appellant’s statement of claim and the material he filed on the motion,
    his difficulties with Cintas started in the latter part of 2003 when the
    efforts to unionize the workforce at the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street facility first started.  The appellant contends that he was
    seen by Cintas as one of the Union organizers, although he was not in fact
    an organizer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant alleges that beginning in 2004, Cintas significantly reduced his
    wages without cause.  This reduction continued through 2004, 2005 and 2006.  In
    addition to reducing his wages, Cintas increased the appellant’s workload
    and subjected him to constant abuse and harassment.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s lawyer wrote to Cintas in December 2004 outlining the appellant’s
    complaints and suggesting that Cintas was trying to pressure the appellant
    to quit his job.  The letter connected the attempts to unionize the Cintas
    workplace on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street and the mistreatment of the appellant.  The letter specifically
    referred to sections of the <i>Act</i> which address anti-union conduct by
    an employer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    May 2006, the appellant’s lawyer (not the lawyer who wrote the earlier letter)  wrote
    a further letter to Cintas.  He complained that since the application for
    union certification in November 2003, the appellant had been the victim of
    ongoing abuse by Cintas resulting in a significant loss of wages and the
    creation of an intolerable working environment.  Counsel described Cintas’ treatment
    of the appellant as constituting constructive dismissal.  He suggested a
    severance package that included payment of the equivalent of eighteen months’
    salary to the appellant.  Cintas did not respond.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 6, 2006, the appellant’s lawyer wrote another letter to Cintas indicating
    that for the reasons set out in the previous correspondence, the appellant
    regarded his contract of employment as repudiated and that he would not be
    returning to work.  The appellant started his wrongful dismissal claim about
    five days later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    outlined above, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union and Cintas attempted to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement
    early in 2006.  During those bargaining sessions, a Union representative
    (not the appellant) complained that Cintas was unilaterally altering the
    working conditions and wages of some of its employees, including the appellant.  The
    Union representative took the position that in doing so, Cintas was violating
    the statutory freeze provisions set out in s. 86 of the <i>Act</i>.  Cintas
    responded to these allegations claiming that any alterations to the wages
    and working conditions were consistent with the historical pattern within
    Cintas’ operation and did not violate s. 86.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union was apparently satisfied with this explanation and did not pursue the
    matter any further.  At no time did the appellant ask the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union to pursue any claim against Cintas for altering his working conditions.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    important points emerge from the summary of the relevant facts.  First, the
    appellant’s claim is in substance a claim of wrongful dismissal based on
    changes to his employment that were so fundamental as to constitute a constructive
    dismissal.  These changes include a significant reduction in his wages and
    an increase in his workload.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    all of Cintas’ alleged misconduct said to constitute constructive dismissal
    occurred between November 2003, when the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union applied for certification and July 6, 2006 when the appellant left
    the employment of Cintas.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union was not decertified until September 2006.  </p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>III</h2>
  <h4>THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Cintas submits that the substance of the appellant’s allegations described
    conduct that is addressed in ss. 72 and 76 of the <i>Act</i>.  These sections
    proscribe various kinds of employer misconduct that is animated, in part
    at least, by anti-union bias.  Certainly, the appellant’s allegations, if
    not in the statement of claim then certainly in his lawyers’
    letters, have that tone.  However, and apart from any allegation that Cintas
    was motivated by anti-union bias, the substance of the appellant’s allegations
    relate to changes in his working conditions, including changes in his wages.  These
    allegations fall four square within the prohibition described in s. 86 of
    the <i>Act</i>.  I think the jurisdictional point can be determined without
    reference to ss. 72 and 76. </p>

    notice triggered the freeze period described in s. 86(1).  That freeze period
    began with the aforementioned notice in September 2005 and continued through
    September 2006 when the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union was decertified.  Consequently, any alteration in the appellant’s wages

    s. 86 of the <i>Act</i> unless the

    review of the case law governing the resolution of competing jurisdictional
    claims in the labour law context can begin with <i>Weber v. Ontario Hydro</i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929.  Weber was receiving sick benefits pursuant to a collective
    agreement.  His employer, Ontario Hydro, suspected that Weber was malingering.  It
    conducted certain surveillance and eventually suspended Weber.  His union
    grieved the suspension and Ontario Hydro’s use of surveillance against Mr.
    Weber. The grievance was settled.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the grievance was outstanding, Weber sued Ontario Hydro alleging various
    torts and <i>Charter</i> breaches.  Ontario Hydro sought an order dismissing
    the lawsuit on the basis that the dispute arose out of the collective agreement
    and was therefore within the exclusive jurisdiction of the grievance procedures
    established by the <i>Act</i> and the collective agreement.  The Supreme
    Court of Canada concluded that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain
    Weber’s lawsuit.  McLachlin J. stated at para. 67:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I conclude that
    mandatory arbitration clauses such as s. 45(1) of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Labour Relations Act</i> generally confer exclusive jurisdiction
    on labour tribunals to deal with all disputes between the parties arising
    from the collective agreement.  <u>The question in each case is whether the
    dispute, viewed with an eye to its essential character, arises from the collective
    agreement.</u>… The exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitrator is subject to
    the residual discretionary power of courts of inherent jurisdiction to grant
    remedies not possessed by the statutory tribunal.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching the conclusion that the <i>Act</i> gave arbitrators exclusive jurisdiction
    over disputes arising out of the collective agreement, McLachlin J. was influenced
    by three consideration (<i>Weber</i> at paras. 41-46).  First, s. 45(1) of
    the <i>Act</i>, an exclusive jurisdiction provision, constituted a clear
    expression of the legislature’s intent to make arbitrators the exclusive
    and final decision makers in disputes arising out of the collective agreement.  Second,
    like other Canadian labour statutes, the <i>Act</i> put a premium on the
    quick and economic resolution of labour disputes in a manner that would minimize
    the disruption in the workplace and the ongoing relationship between the
    employer and its employees.  An interpretation that gave the courts concurrent
    jurisdiction with arbitrators would undermine those policy objectives.  Finally,
    the existing case law favoured the view that mandatory arbitration clauses
    in labour statutes deprived the courts of jurisdiction in matters covered
    by those clauses.</p>

    analysis favoured in <i>Weber</i> is not restricted to circumstances where
    the dispute arises out of matters that are the subject of a collective agreement
    requiring mandatory arbitration.  Even before <i>Weber</i>, the Supreme Court
    of Canada had held in <i>Gendron v. Supply and Services Union of the Public
    Service Alliance of Canada, Local 50057</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1298 that an
    employee’s complaint against his union for unfair representation could not
    be brought by way of an action in civil court because the relevant labour
    legislation gave the Labour Board exclusive jurisdiction to hear statutory
    claims of unfair representation.  L’Heureux-Dub<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> J.
    said at pp. 1326-1327:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Allowing parties
      to disputes which, by their very nature, are those contemplated and regulated

      an exclusive and comprehensive mechanism for labour dispute resolution,
      particularly in the context of the present case.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I concluded earlier
    that the common law duty of fair representation was by necessary implication
    ousted in situations where the statute applies.  <u>As the statute is applicable

    to <i>Weber</i>, this court applied the jurisdictional analysis to a dispute
    that arose after the expiration of a collective agreement.  In <i>Dagher

    sued their employer for breach of contract in the course of an ongoing labour
    dispute.  These employees claimed that certain brokerage fees charged to
    them pursuant to an agreement were improperly increased by the employer in
    the course of negotiations towards a new collective agreement.  A similar
    claim had been advanced before the Labour Board where the union argued that
    the unwarranted increase in the fees constituted a breach of the employer’s
    obligation to bargain towards a new collective agreement in good faith.  The
    proceedings before the Board had not been completed when some of the employees
    commenced a lawsuit in the Superior Court.  The employer argued that the

    practices where those allegations were made in the context of negotiations
    for a new collective agreement.  He concluded that the allegation that the
    employer had improperly increased the brokerage fees was an allegation of
    a failure to bargain in good faith, which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Board.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>[T]he principles

      of the Act that occur after the expiry of the collective agreement:  s.

    motion judge relied on <i>Dagher</i> in holding that the Board had exclusive
    jurisdiction over the appellant’s allegations.  Like the employee in <i>Dagher</i>,
    the appellant’s complaints relate to events that occurred when there was
    no collective agreement in place but negotiations towards achieving a collective
    agreement were underway.</p>

    recent case law from the Supreme Court of Canada has reaffirmed the application
    of the <i>Weber</i> analysis to all forms of decision-making embedded in
    labour legislation that provides a comprehensive scheme for the resolution
    of labour disputes:  see <i>Regina Police Assn. Inc. v. Regina (City) Board
    of Police Commissioners</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 360 at paras. 34-35;  <i>Vaughan

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the face of this jurisprudence, the appellant relies on two decisions in
    the Superior Court.  <i>Armitage v. Z.C.L. Composites Inc.</i>, [1999] O.J.
    No. 3789 is factually indistinguishable from this case insofar as the jurisdictional
    point is concerned.  The employees in <i>Armitage</i> were laid off while
    the union and the employer were engaged in negotiations aimed at producing
    the first collective agreement.  The employees sued for wrongful dismissal.  In
    holding that the lawsuit could proceed, the motion judge said at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There was no
    collective agreement and no grievance procedure, or provision for binding
    arbitration in force when the facts complained of arose in this case.  <u>As
    the plaintiffs’ layoffs or dismissals occurred during a period [when] there
    was no collective agreement in force, therefore I am satisfied that the claim
    can proceed through the courts.</u>  [Emphasis added.]<u>  </u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge made no reference to s. 86 of the <i>Act</i> and its application
    to the time period during which the union and the employer are attempting
    to negotiate the initial collective agreement.  The motion judge also made
    no reference to the possibility of a claim to the Board under s. 96 alleging
    a wrongful variation of the employee’s terms of employment during the statutory
    freeze period set out in s. 86.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    failure to advert to s. 86 and to consider a possible complaint under that
    section led the motion judge into error.  I think <i>Armitage</i> was wrongly
    decided.  I prefer the analysis, in similar facts, found in <i>Roberts v.
    Serca Food Services Inc.</i> (2001), 15 C.C.E.L. (3d) 92 (S.C.J.).  In that
    case, the motion judge held that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction to
    consider allegations of wrongful dismissal arising between the date on which
    the union was certified and the date on which the first collective agreement
    took effect.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second case from the Superior Court relied on by the appellant is <i>Duncan
    v. Cadillac Fairview Corp.</i> (1999), 178 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup> ) 530.  In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Duncan</i>, the employee sued the employer alleging various torts.  The
    facts underlying the employee’s claim were somewhat unusual and, like the
    motion judge, I think it is arguable that at least some of the claims did
    not fall within the ambit of matters that were the subject of the collective
    agreement.  The motion judge could have decided the jurisdictional issue
    in favour of the employee on that basis alone.  However, in the course of
    analyzing the employer’s argument that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction
    to hear the lawsuit, the motion judge said at para. 31:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The principles
    approved in <i>Weber</i> have no application unless the particular dispute
    arises out a collective agreement.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent that the motion judge’s decision depends on his interpretation
    of <i>Weber</i>, I think he reads that case too narrowly.  There is also
    no analysis of the potential application of s. 86 to the complaint put forward
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Duncan</i>.  On the facts as I understand them, the employee’s alleged
    wrongful dismissal occurred after certification and before a collective agreement
    was reached.  The statutory freeze requirements in s. 86 were applicable
    and, in my view, could have supported a complaint under s. 96.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also relies on <i>Guenette v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 601 (

      <st1:place

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That case required an examination of several grievance and arbitration
    provisions in the <i>Public Services Staff Relations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. P-35.  This court ultimately held that those provisions did not exclude
    the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.  The same sections that were examined
    in <i>Guenette</i>, were subsequently examined by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Vaughan</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The analysis of the legislation and the result

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Guenette</i> did,
    however, use the analysis developed in <i>Weber</i>.  Applying that analysis,
    Laskin J.A., for the court, concluded at paras. 49-50 that the grievance
    mechanism in the legislation was not intended by Parliament to oust the jurisdiction
    of the ordinary courts.  In reaching that conclusion, he stressed, among
    other factors, the limited nature of the finality clause in issue and the
    lack of any recourse to a specialized autonomous decision-making body under
    the operable grievance provisions.  I take no issue with the analysis in <i>Guenette</i>,
    but note that this case, of course, involves a very different statute and
    a very different decision-making mechanism.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>V</h2>
  <h4>THE APPLICATION OF THE <i>WEBER</i> ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    its core, the analysis used in <i>Weber</i> to determine whether the relevant
    legislation has given the tribunal exclusive jurisdiction over a dispute
    is an exercise in statutory interpretation.  The court must determine whether
    the applicable legislation precludes access to the court in favour of the
    grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the specialized tribunal.  <i>Weber</i> looked
    at three factors, the existence and scope of a finality clause, policy considerations,
    and the prevailing jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Weber</i>,
    at para. 45, the court referred to s. 45(1) of the <i>Act</i> (now s. 48(1))
    which required that all disputes arising under a collective agreement be
    resolved by “final and binding” arbitration.  McLachlin J. read that provision
    as leaving no room for concurrent jurisdiction in the ordinary courts over
    disputes arising out of the collective agreement.  Section 114(1) of the <i>Act</i> cloaks
    decisions made by the Board under s. 96 in the same exclusivity and finality
    as is provided to arbitrators’ decisions by s. 48(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  The
    language of s. 114(1) strongly suggests the same conclusion with respect
    to the jurisdictional issue as was reached in <i>Weber</i>, where, as in
    this case, the disputes fall under s. 96 of the <i>Act</i>:  see <i>Daghar</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    paras. 21-22.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    policy considerations evoked in <i>Weber</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 46, to
    assist in the resolution of the jurisdictional question have full application
    here and point towards the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board.  Allowing
    individual employees access to the court to litigate what are in their factual
    essence claims of a breach of the statutory freeze period can only complicate
    ongoing union-employer relations, increase costs, delay resolutions, and
    undercut the values inherent in the collective bargaining process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    prevailing jurisprudence, the third consideration referred to in <i>Weber</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    paras. 41-44, also points to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board in this
    case.  The motion judge relied on <i>Daghar</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 7
    of his reasons.  Although <i>Daghar</i> addressed breaches of sections of
    the <i>Act</i> other than s. 86, it ultimately held that where complaints
    fell within the jurisdiction of the Board under s. 96, that jurisdiction
    was exclusive.  That ratio has direct application to this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    concluded that the <i>Weber</i> analysis applies, it remains to determine
    whether on that analysis the appellant’s complaints are within the exclusive
    jurisdiction of the Board.  <i>Weber</i> commands at para. 52 that the court
    look at “the essential character” of the dispute and not the legal label
    one of the parties may choose to place on that dispute.  The “essential character” of
    the dispute is determined by reference to the factual matrix of that dispute:
    see
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Vaughan</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    factual essence of the appellant’s claim is that Cintas significantly reduced
    his wages, increased his workload, and made it impossible for him to carry
    on at his job.  The appellant characterizes this conduct as constructive
    dismissal and a breach of the contract of employment with Cintas which preceded
    any union certification.  That classification does not, however, change the
    essential factual nature of the appellant’s allegations.  These allegations
    fall squarely within the prohibition in s. 86(2) against altering “the rates
    of wages or any other term or condition of employment”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    essential nature of the appellant’s allegations would appear to place them
    within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board on a <i>Weber</i> analysis.  There
    remains the question of whether there is anything that would justify allowing
    the claim to proceed as an exercise of the Superior Court’s residual discretionary
    power:  see <i>Weber</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 67.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Weber</i> indicates
    that the court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction where the remedy sought
    cannot be granted by the statutory tribunal that has jurisdiction.  That
    is not a concern in this case.  Section 96(4)(c) expressly contemplates an
    order by the Board compensating an employee for “loss of earnings or other
    employment benefits”.  That award, if made, may ultimately be enforced as
    if it were an order of the Superior Court:  see s. 96(6) of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant, however, submits that the appellant does not have an effective
    remedy under the <i>Act </i>because he cannot personally make a complaint
    under s. 96 of an alleged breach of the statutory freeze provisions in s.
    86.  That complaint can only be brought by the union.  Counsel is correct
    in his assertion that only the union can bring a complaint alleging a breach
    of s. 86.  However, this fact provides no basis for invoking the court’s
    inherent jurisdiction as an “end around” the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction.  As
    observed by Binnie J. in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Vaughan</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 25, employees must also count on their
    union to carry forward grievances brought under the terms of a collective
    agreement.  The individual employee cannot invoke the mandatory arbitration
    provisions referable to such grievances.  If the union refuses to do so,
    the employee’s recourse is by way of a complaint alleging unfair representation
    by the union in contravention of s. 74 of the <i>Act</i>.  The appellant
    has exactly the same remedy.  Were I to accept the submission that the appellant’s
    inability to personally mount a claim under s. 86 should take him out of
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board, it would follow that employees should
    also be able to sue in respect of grievances clearly covered by the collective
    agreement.  To so hold, would be to turn the current jurisprudence inside
    out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant also submits that his lawsuit should be allowed to proceed
    because there is no realistic chance that the union will bring a s. 96 complaint
    in reference to the allegations made by the appellant.  In making this submission,
    counsel stresses that the union has been decertified.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have no way of knowing what the union would or would not do if asked to bring
    the complaint.  The appellant has never asked the union to do so.  I cannot
    assume that the union would not comply with any obligations that it has with
    respect to the fair representation of the appellant.  The union raised the
    matter with Cintas in the course of negotiations.  It received certain responses
    from Cintas and did not pursue the matter.  I can only assume that it would
    have exercised its duty of fair representation to the appellant had he taken
    the opportunity which he clearly had then to put his case before the union
    and ask it to advance a claim before the Board:  see <i>Allan v. Alberta</i>,
