    admissibility of the evidence? Second, what must the Crown prove to show
    that the investigating officer made a valid Intoxilizer demand under s. 254(3)
    of the <i>Criminal Code </i>where the officer’s grounds for the demand depend
    upon the results of a test with an approved screening device?    </p>

    80” contrary to s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The appellant did
    not serve any notice prior to trial indicating that she intended to ask for

    appellant then applied for leave to appeal to this court on the basis that
    the appeal judge erred in failing to enter an acquittal.  The only issues
    on this appeal concern the submission that the appeal judge should have entered
    an acquittal.  The Crown has not appealed from the order that there be a
    new trial.</p>

    is only necessary to refer to the facts concerning the validity of the Intoxilizer
    demand.  The facts relating to this issue were given by Provincial Constable
    Twilley.  On April 1, 2005, Constable Twilley was stationed at a R.I.D.E.
    stop in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Alton.  At 9:15 p.m. she stopped a truck driven by the appellant.  The appellant
    told the officer that she had had two glasses of wine, her eyes were bloodshot,
    she had difficulty finding her licence and smelled of alcohol.  Accordingly,
    the officer made the following demand to the appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I demand that
    you provide forthwith such a sample of your breath as I require for analysis <i>by
    the approved screening device</i> and that you accompany me for this purpose.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer testified that she did a “demo of the Alcotest” to show the appellant
    how it worked.  The appellant blew into the device and registered a fail.  The
    officer arrested the appellant for “over 80” and “read [her] a breath demand
    for the Intoxilizer”.  At this point in the officer’s evidence an issue arose
    concerning the admissibility of statements that the appellant made to the
    officer.  The trial judge stated that “even though no <i>Charter</i> application
    has been raised or made up until now, I certainly wouldn’t have a problem
    with one being made at that point in time”.  Crown counsel then questioned
    the officer further about her grounds for making the Intoxilizer demand and
    especially in relation to the results of the approved screening device.  The
    officer testified that as a result of the appellant registering a “fail” she
    formed an opinion that the appellant was impaired by alcohol.  She then briefly
    described her training with the device, which she described as “the Alcotest”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    back at the police detachment, the appellant spoke to a lawyer and then complied
    with the Intoxilizer demand.  Without objection, Crown counsel filed the
    Certificate of a Qualified Technician showing the results of the Intoxilizer
    tests.  It was marked as Exhibit 1 and shows the results of tests taken at
    10:45 p.m. and 11:06 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    counsel cross-examined Constable Twilley on her grounds for making the demand
    and the officer confirmed that her basis for the Intoxilizer demand depended
    on the results of the test with the “Alcotest”.  The officer clarified that
    she had grounds for believing the appellant had committed the “over 80” offence,
    not impaired driving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    Constable Twilley’s evidence, Crown counsel called the Intoxilizer operator.  Constable
    Cormier testified without objection that Constable Twilley told her that
    she had conducted “a roadside test with the approved screening device which
    the accused registered a reading of fail on that approved screening device”.  Constable
    Cormier also identified Exhibit 1.  Defence counsel again raised no objection
    to the admissibility of the certificate or the officer’s references to the
    results of the test.  As well, Crown counsel tendered through Constable Cormier
    two Subject Test Reports that are produced by the Intoxilizer and show the
    results of the tests.  Defence counsel did not object to the admissibility
    of these reports, which were marked as Exhibits 2C and 2D.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel then sought to file an affidavit from a forensic toxicologist to
    the effect that based on the Intoxilizer results of 217 and 207 milligrams
    of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, the appellant’s ability to operate
    a motor vehicle would have been impaired by alcohol.  There was a brief argument
    about the admissibility of this affidavit that turned on the technical requirements
    of s. 657.3 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial judge ruled that the
    affidavit was admissible.  Crown counsel then closed her case.  The defence
    offered no objection to the admissibility of the results of the Intoxilizer
    test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence called the appellant, her partner and an expert toxicologist.  In
    the course of the expert’s evidence, defence counsel referred him to the
    results of the Intoxilizer test.  At the conclusion of the defence case,
    the trial judge and counsel discussed an adjournment for argument.  At that
    time, the only issue appeared to be the <i>Carter</i> defence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SUBMISSIONS

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case resumed approximately one month later at which point, for the first
    time, the appellant’s counsel indicated that he was possibly raising a <i>Charter</i> argument
    concerning the admissibility of the Intoxilizer results.  Crown counsel stated
    that she had received no notice of any <i>Charter</i> issue and that during
    the trial the only <i>Charter</i> issue that seemed to be raised concerned
    the admissibility of the appellant’s statements because of a possible violation
    of the appellant’s right to counsel.  The trial judge ruled as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[O]nce the evidence
    comes out if there is no <i>Charter</i> issue that arose, as far as defence
    was concerned, based upon the disclosure but once evidence was given at the
    trial that raises a <i>Charter </i>issue, I think it is only appropriate
    that the defence be allowed to argue that.  Certainly counsel, having heard
    all of the evidence, <i>counsel for the</i> <i>Crown having heard all of
    the evidence as it has come out in the same way the defence has, it is not
    prejudiced in any way by that argument being raised</i>, so if there are <i>Charter</i> issues
    I will hear them. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel then made submissions.  First, he argued that the certificate was
    invalid because while the result of the first test was identified by the
    full date including the year, the second test did not include the year.  Second,
    he argued that the Crown had failed to prove that the appellant was given
    a true copy of the certificate.  He continued with various other technical
    arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel then turned to the issue of “reasonable and probable grounds”.  His
    argument here was that the officer did not have grounds to make the Intoxilizer
    demand because the Crown had not proved that the device used was an approved
    screening device.  Counsel pointed out that Constable Twilley referred to
    the device as an “Alcotest”.  Finally, counsel turned to the <i>Carter</i> defence
    issue.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave lengthy reasons addressing all of the issues raised.  Her
    reasons on the issue of reasonable and probable grounds were as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fourth argument
    of the defence is that there were no reasonable and probable grounds for
    making a demand for a sample of Ms. Gundy’s breath, as there was no evidence
    that the roadside screen was conducted properly. The submission is that the
    evidence did not establish that an approved device was used to administer
    the screen. The case of <i>R. v. Brown</i>, [1998] O.J. 1431 (Ont. Gen. Div.)
    was cited in support of the proposition that absent reference to an approved
    screening device, or evidence naming a device which has been approved for
    use, the evidence of reasonable and probable grounds is not admissible.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the <i>Brown</i> decision,
    the officer administering the screen testified that it was a “Dragar PA3”,
    which was not an approved device. In the case at bar, Officer Twilley referred
    to the device she used by name, an Alcotest. She also, in her evidence, indicated
    that she said to Ms. Gundy, “I demand that you provide forthwith such sample
    of your breath as I require for analysis by the approved screening device
    and that you accompany me for this purpose”, and that Ms. Gundy then did
    so. In addition, Officer Cormier testified that she received the grounds
    for the demand from Officer Twilley based upon Officer Twilley administering
    a screen with “an approved screening device”. Based upon that evidence, I
    am satisfied that an approved screening device was indeed used, and that
    there were proper grounds to make the demand for a sample of Ms. Gundy’s
    breath.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      APPEAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, the appellant appealed to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court.  The appeal judge pointed out that Crown
    counsel had not had notice of the <i>Charter</i> issue and he said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    quite properly and fairly agreed to have counsel argue it and she dealt with
    it, but it does contextualize somewhat the type of evidence that may have
    been given in a more casual manner than might have been anticipated if the <i>Charter</i> issue
    was known to be a live issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge then went on to deal with the Alcotest issue and reasonable
    and probable grounds.  He concluded that the evidence showed that an approved
    screening device was used and that there were proper grounds to make the
    Intoxilizer demand.  He then dealt with the other ground of appeal and held
    that because the trial judge had misapprehended some of the defence evidence
    going to the <i>Carter </i>defence, there must be a new trial.</p>

    counsel took no objection to the admissibility of the results of the Intoxilizer
    tests either when the certificate was tendered during the evidence of Constable
    Twilley or during the testimony of the Intoxilizer operator, Constable Cormier.  He
    also did not object to Constable Cormier’s testimony about the results of
    the tests or the admissibility of the Subject Test Reports that also showed
    the results of the Intoxilizer tests.  Further, no objection was taken to
    the admissibility of any of this evidence at the close of the Crown’s case.  Finally,
    the defence expert referred to this evidence during his testimony.  The first
    inkling that there was any concern about the admissibility of this part of
    the Crown’s case came a month later during submissions.  In my view, the
    objections came too late.</p>

      self-evident that objections to admissibility of evidence must be made

      would exercise that discretion is if other evidence subsequently given

    at the completion of the trial.  Allowing the argument at that stage did
    not serve the interests of justice.  I do not agree that the Crown was not

    timely objection been taken, Crown counsel would have had the option of calling
    additional evidence.  A month later, the case was closed and presumably the
    witnesses were gone.  As it turned out, the trial judge dismissed the objection,
    but the Crown could have been unfairly prejudiced because of the defence’s
    failure to make a timely objection.  These observations do not relate solely
    to the <i>Charter</i> issue but apply to all of the other objections to the

    requires an accused to give notice of an application to exclude evidence
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  That was not done in this case.  The
    courts must be flexible in their application of Rule 30 and a trial judge

    made under subsection 254(3)”.  The argument is that
    “demand” must mean a valid demand and a valid demand is one made where, in
    the words of s. 254(3), the peace officer “believes on reasonable and probable
    grounds that a person is committing, or at any time within the preceding

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It

      [now s. 254(5)] of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, it does not render inadmissible
      certificate evidence in the case of a charge under s. 236 [now s. 253(b)]
      of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The motive which actuates a peace officer
      in making a demand under s. 235(1) [now s. 254(3)] is not a relevant consideration

      argument relating to the s. 258(1)(c) presumption runs along similar lines
      since the opening words are virtually identical:  “where samples of the
      breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection
      254(3)”.  It would seem to me that <i>Rilling</i> is a complete answer
      to that argument as well: see <i>R. v. Anderson</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1900
      (

    between the admissibility of the certificate or the operation of the presumption,
    writing that proof of reasonable and probable grounds was a condition precedent
    with respect to both.  He said this at p. 91:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>I

      to the demand under s. 235(1) was inserted by Parliament with the intention
      of limiting those cases where the analysis could be proved by a certificate
      of a qualified technician and then that such analysis would provide <i>prima
      facie</i> proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused
      only to those cases where the peace officer had, on reasonable and probable
      grounds, believed that the accused was or had been driving while impaired.
      This was only a proper requirement when the test was one which the citizen
      was required to submit to on penalty of committing an offence if he refused.</span></p>

    the advent of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> should have an impact
    on <i>Rilling</i>. Again, the argument is straightforward.  The taking of
    breath samples is a warrantless seizure.  A minimum constitutional requirement
    for a valid seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> is that
    the seizure was authorized by law: <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 14. A lawful seizure of breath samples requires that the
    officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the motorist
    committed an offence under s. 253.  Accordingly, if a police officer took
    breath samples from a motorist in circumstances where the officer did not
    have reasonable and probable grounds, the seizure would be unlawful and violate
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and the evidence obtained would potentially be
    inadmissible under s.&nbsp;24(2).  This was the holding of Cory&nbsp;J. in <i>R.
    v. Bernshaw</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal issue in <i>Bernshaw</i> turned on the validity of the approved
    screening device demand and whether the police officer should have waited
    fifteen minutes before taking the sample to ensure the motorist did not have
    any alcohol in his mouth.  Three sets of reasons for judgment were delivered
    but only Cory J., speaking for himself, Lamer C.J.C. and Iacobucci J. dealt
    with the <i>Rilling </i>issue.  He held that <i>Rilling </i>is still good
    law and that absent a <i>Charter</i> challenge to the admissibility of the
    results, the prosecution need not establish that the officer had reasonable
    and probable grounds.  He wrote as follows at paras. 40-41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      British Columbia Court of Appeal, in this case, held that <i>Rilling</i> was
      no longer good law since it was decided prior to the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view, the Court of Appeal erred in taking this position. Certainly,
      the <i>Charter</i> is relevant. An accused may be able to establish on
      the balance of probabilities that the taking of breath samples infringed
      his <i>Charter</i> rights. For example, it might be contended that the
      requisite reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand
      were absent, and that, in the circumstances, the admission of those breathalyzer
      results would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In those
      circumstances, the breathalyzer evidence might well not be accepted. Yet,
      where an accused complies with the breathalyzer demand, the Crown need
      not prove as part of its case that it had reasonable and probable grounds
      to make that demand. Rather, I think, the onus rests upon the accused to
      establish on the balance of probabilities that there has been a <i>Charter</i> breach
      and that, under s. 24(2), the evidence should be excluded. There should
      not be an automatic exclusion of the breathalyzer test results.</span></p>

      grounds exist is not only a statutory but a constitutional requirement
      as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure under s. 8 of the <i>Canadian

      v. Woods</i> (2005), 197 C.C.C. (3d) 353.  Like <i>Bernshaw</i>, <i>Woods</i> was
      a case engaging the validity of the approved screening device demand as
      the basis for reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer
      demand.  The court held that a refusal to comply with the approved screening
      device demand could not be the basis for reasonable and probable grounds
      to make a breath demand.  The court also held that a fail in response to
      a demand made over an hour later at the police station could not be the
      basis for reasonable and probable grounds because such a demand is illegal,
      not being a demand to provide samples “forthwith” as required by s. 254(2).  Unfortunately,
      the court made no reference to the basis for excluding the breathalyzer
      results, nor did the court discuss <i>Rilling </i>or <i>Bernshaw </i>in
      relation to the reasonable and probable grounds issue.  Fish J. speaking

      find it difficult to believe that the Supreme Court of Canada intended
      to overrule <i>Rilling</i> without referring to it.  In my view, although
      it is troubling that there is no reference to the <i>Charter </i>in the
      reasons for judgment, the more reasonable explanation is that the court
      found that the accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights were infringed and excluded
      the evidence on that basis albeit without going through the full <i>Charter</i> analysis.  Also
      see <i>R. v. Bilokvely</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 5131 (C.J.) at para. 24. I
      find some support for this view from the reasons of the Manitoba Court
      of Appeal in <i>Woods</i> reported at (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 70.  Speaking
      for the court, Philp J.A. held at para. 31 that the actions of the police
      in taking breath samples for the approved screening device test at the
      police station without consent or statutory authority and the subsequent
      admission of evidence of the breathalyzer samples “resulted in an unfair
      trial” and a denial of “fundamental justice”.  It seems to me that this
      is <i>Charter </i>language and other portions of the reasons show that
      the case was fought on the basis of a <i>Charter</i> challenge to the admissibility
      of the breathalyzer results.</span></p>

      there is the decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>R. v.
      Searle</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 374.  In <i>Searle</i>, the accused
      did not seek to exclude the breath test results and made no <i>Charter</i> argument.  Rather,
      he argued that the Crown could not rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c).  The
      accused argued that because the officer did not have reasonable and probable
      grounds to make the demand, the demand was improper and therefore the presumption
      was not triggered.  Larlee J.A. speaking for the court at para. 25 agreed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Since
      the demand was not made in strict compliance with s. 254(3) of the <i>Code</i>,
      it is unlawful. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption found in s. 258(1)(c)
      unless the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer
      demand in the first place.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    leading judgment on the question of reasonable and probable grounds to make
    an Intoxilizer demand where the officer relies upon the results from an approved
    screening device is that of Sopinka J. in <i>Bernshaw</i>.  In that case,
    Sopinka J. pointed out that while the issue is the officer’s belief, that
    belief has a subjective and objective component.  As he said at para. 48:  “<span lang=EN>s.
    254(3) of the <i>Code</i> requires that the police officer subjectively have
    an honest belief that the suspect has committed the offence and, objectively,
    there must exist reasonable grounds for this belief”.  Sopinka J. held that
    where the officer is aware that the results of the approved screening device
    are unreliable because of the circumstances in which the test was administered,
    then the officer cannot have the requisite subjective belief.  However, he
    also held at para. 80: “Where the particular screening device used has been
    approved under the statutory scheme, the officer is entitled to rely on its
    accuracy unless there is credible evidence to the contrary.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    focus of Sopinka J.’s reasons is almost entirely on the subjective component
    of reasonable and probable grounds.  The earlier decision in <i>R. v. Storrey</i> (1990),
    53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.) dealing with the arrest power assists in understanding
    the objective component of reasonable and probable grounds.  There at p.
    324, Cory J. held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      is not sufficient for the police officer to personally believe that he
      or she has reasonable and probable grounds to make an arrest. Rather, <i>it
      must be objectively established that those reasonable and probable grounds
      did in fact exist.</i> That is to say a reasonable person, standing in
      the shoes of the police officer, would have believed that reasonable and
      probable grounds existed to make the arrest [citations omitted].  [Emphasis
      added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note
    that it is the reasonable and probable grounds that must be shown to exist.  It
    may turn out that, in fact, the motorist’s ability to drive was not impaired
    or that the motorist’s blood alcohol level did not exceed the legal limit.  The
    question is whether a reasonable person with the same information as the
    officer would have concluded that there were reasonable and probable grounds
    to believe an offence had been committed.  Thus, if the device used by the
    officer was not in fact an approved screening device, the objective component
    may or may not be made out; it depends upon whether the officer could reasonably
    believe that the device he or she was using was an approved device.  I turn
    then to the issue of what kind of evidence is required to show that an <i>approved</i> screening
    device was used.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Identification
      of the Approved Screening Device</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    determining whether the particular device was approved, the court must consider
    all the evidence, including any circumstantial evidence.  The court is entitled
    to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence.  Thus, in my view, if the
    officer in his or her testimony refers to the device as an “approved screening
    device”, the trial judge is entitled to infer that the device was indeed
    an approved device.  As such, the officer is entitled to rely upon the “fail” recorded
    by the device to find that there were reasonable and probable grounds to
    make the breath demand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer is not required to refer to the device by its particular brand and
    number such as “Alcotest 7410 GLC”.  Further, references to a part only of
    the identification such as “Alcotest” or “Alcotest GLC” do not rebut the
    reasonable inference from the officer’s reference to the device as approved
    that it is indeed an approved screening device.  The addition of the manufacturer’s
    name, for example “Drager Alcotest 7410 GLC”, is likewise not fatal: see <i>R.
    v. Neziol </i>(2001), 22 M.V.R. (4th) 299 (Ont. S.C.J.). Further, in my view,
    the context in which the officer refers to the device as approved is of no
    particular moment.  Thus, if the officer testifies that he or she used an
    approved screening device, or agrees with the suggestion that it is an approved
    screening device, such testimony is direct evidence upon which the trial
    judge can rely: see <i>e.g. R. v. Latulippe</i> (2005), 26 M.V.R. (5th) 97
    (Ont. S.C.J.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
    as here, the officer states that she made a demand that the motorist provide
    a sample for analysis by the approved screening device, surely the trier
    of fact can reasonably infer that the officer used an approved device.  That
    was the holding of the trial judge in this case and I agree with that decision.
    As Langdon J. said in <i>R. v. James</i>, [1995] O.J. No.&nbsp;190 (Gen.
    Div.) at para. 5, “what is the likelihood that the O.P.P. would supply its
    constables with an unapproved device with which to enforce the R.I.D.E. programme?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, cases holding that the officer did not have reasonable and probable
    grounds because, although the officer referred to the device as an approved
    screening device, he or she used a shorthand reference to the device or transposed
    some of the numbers or letters are wrongly decided.  In the absence of some
    credible evidence to the contrary, it is not reasonable to infer that an
    officer who says that he or she used an approved screening device actually
    used an unapproved device.  That was the holding of this court in <i>R. v.
    Kosa</i> (1992), 42 M.V.R. (2d) 290 at 291:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>We
      are of the view that the manufacturer's model number given by the officer
      in evidence as Model JA3 rather than Model J3A as set forth in the regulations
      was no more than an innocent transposition of a number and letter and that <i>the
      unchallenged assertion by the officer that it was an approved screening
      device is sufficient proof thereof</i>. If such is the case, there is no
      need to look further to justify the finding of reasonable and probable
      grounds.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course the question of whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds
    depends on the circumstances of each case.  My only point here is that the
    trial judge is not confined to direct evidence and is entitled to and should
    draw reasonable inferences from the proven facts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    even if the Crown is unable to establish that the officer had the requisite
    reasonable and probable grounds and thus the accused has shown a violation
    of his or her s. 8 rights, exclusion of the results of the Intoxilizer is
    not automatic.  The accused must still establish that admission of the evidence
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute under s. 24(2) of
    the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>R. v. Lotozky</i> (2006), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 509 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, on a charge of “over 80” or impaired driving, where an issue arises
    as to the admissibility of the results of the Intoxilizer/Breathalyzer analysis,
    the trial court should proceed as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Generally</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         If
    the accused does not challenge the admissibility of the results of the Intoxilizer/Breathalyzer
    analysis on the basis that the accused’s rights under the <i>Charter</i> were
    violated, the Crown is not required to establish that the officer had reasonable
    and probable grounds to make the s. 254(3) demand.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         Any
    objection to the admissibility of the results of the analysis should ordinarily
    be made, at the latest, when the Crown tenders the evidence either through
    a certificate under s. 258(1)(g) or by way of oral testimony.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.         Where
    the accused intends to object to the admissibility of the results of the
    analysis on the basis of a violation of the <i>Charter</i>, the accused should
    comply with Rule 30 of the <i>Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice in Criminal
    Proceedings</i>, although a trial judge has a discretion to dispense with
    notice in a proper case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b><i>Charter</i> challenge
      because of lack of reasonable and probable grounds</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.         Where
    the accused objects to the admissibility of the results of the analysis pursuant
    to ss. 8 and 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> that the officer lacked reasonable
    and probable grounds to make the demand, the burden is on the Crown to establish
    the requisite grounds.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.         Reasonable
    and probable grounds involve an objective and subjective test.  Where the
    grounds depend upon a “fail” from an approved screening device, the Crown
    must prove that the officer reasonably believed that he or she was using
    an approved device.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>6.         In
    the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, the officer’s testimony
    that he or she made a demand with an approved screening device is sufficient
    evidence that the officer had the requisite reasonable belief.  The officer
    is not required to give the particular model number or otherwise identify
    the device.  Obvious errors such as incomplete reference to the model number
    do not undermine the officer’s testimony that the device was an approved
    screening device.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>7.         Where
    the officer did not have the requisite reasonable and probable grounds, the
    warrantless seizure of breath samples for analysis in an Intoxilizer or breathalyzer
    is an unreasonable seizure within the meaning of s. 8 and the results may
    be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter.</i></p>

    light of the above, it will be apparent that I agree with the trial judge
    and the appeal judge that the Crown established that the officer used an
    approved screening device.  The officer’s reference to an “Alcotest” did
    not undermine her direct evidence that she used an approved screening device.  She
    therefore had reasonable and probable grounds to make the Intoxilizer demand
    and there was no violation of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
