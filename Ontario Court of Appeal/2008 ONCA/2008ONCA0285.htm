    three questions of law argued in this court were raised in the summary conviction
    appeal court and addressed by Dunnet J. in her careful reasons.  We see no
    error of law in her analysis.  We propose to make only brief reference to
    one of the grounds of appeal.</p>

    observed by Dunnet J., the trial judge used inappropriate phraseology in
    considering the second step in the <i>W.D.</i> inquiry.  The trial judge
    asked whether the defence evidence might reasonably be true instead of
    asking herself whether the defence evidence left her with a reasonable doubt.  Whether
    those formulations would ever yield different results is debatable.  However,
    the might reasonably be true formulation does pose a risk, particularly
    in jury cases, of an improper reversal of the burden of proof.</p>

    the context of the defence raised in this case and the trial judges findings
    as to credibility, like Dunnet J., we cannot assign reversible error to the
    trial judge in respect of her application of a fundamental principle like
    the burden of proof based on her single use of an inapt phrase.  In other
    parts of her reasons, the trial judge made it clear that she understood that
    the burden of proof was on the Crown throughout the case to prove guilt beyond
    a reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence.  </p>

    summary conviction appeal judge found that the trial judge made an error
    of law by misstating the second branch of the <i>W.D</i>. test, asking whether
    the evidence given by the appellant and his wife might reasonably be true,
    instead of whether it raised a reasonable doubt. As explained by Fish J.A.
    (as he then was) in <i>R. v. Mathieu</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Qc.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the might reasonably be true test derives from the doctrine of recent
    possession, where it effectively reverses the onus of proof. Its use as part
    of the <i>W.D</i>. test is at best confusing and at worst undermines the
    presumption of innocence by placing a higher onus on the accused than is
    required by the <i>W.D</i>. approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary conviction appeal judge applied and followed this courts decision
    in <i>R. v. Rattray</i> (2007), 222 O.A.C. 28, in which it held that the might
    reasonably be true error does not amount to reversible error where the trial
    judge completely rejected the appellants evidence as untrue and found the
    Crowns case to be overwhelming. In my view, she erred in so doing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants evidence was essentially that after his stepdaughter and her
    family moved out of his house, his loving relationship with them continued
    but he did not see them that much and he was never alone with the complainant
    and her two brothers, as the complainant alleged. As noted by appellants
    counsel, the complainants brothers were not called as witnesses to either
    address this issue or the corollary, that is, if they were together, what
    they observed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not completely reject the appellants evidence in this case.
    Rather, she found only that his credibility was undermined by his minimization
    of the number of occasions where he had contact with the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, this was not an overwhelming Crown case. The only evidence of
    the commission of any offence came from the complainant. The trial judge
    had to explain away discrepancies in the complainants evidence, including
    her initial disclosure of only one incident of sexual touching later followed
    by serial disclosure of five to seven incidents of sexual touching. The
    trial judge also had to overlook the indication from the complainants vocabulary
    that the complainants evidence had been somewhat contaminated between
    her initial disclosure and her testimony. Although the trial judge ultimately
    accepted the complainants evidence as credible, it cannot be said to constitute
    an overwhelming case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this was not a case where the seriousness of the <i>W.D.</i> error
    can be overcome on the basis of the two reasons given by this court in <i>Rattray</i>.
    The appellant denied the complainants allegations. The trial judge concluded
    that his story could not reasonably be true, while explaining away the
    discrepancies in the complainants account. In these circumstances, one cannot
    be certain that the trial judges error of law in articulating and applying
    the burden of proof could not have affected the verdict. I would therefore
    grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order
    a new trial.</p>
