    appeal concerns the interpretation of a pollution exclusion clause in a directors’ and
    officers’ liability policy.  The appellant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
    (“
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty”), issued a directors’ and officers’ liability policy (“D&amp;O Policy”)
    to the respondent mining company, Boliden Limited (“Boliden”).  The D&amp;O
    Policy insured the directors and officers of Boliden in respect of specified
    losses arising from claims made against them during the currency of the policy,
    including damages and defence costs.  </p>

    the coverage period, the directors and officers were indemnified by Boliden
    for defence costs they incurred in connection with class actions brought
    against them by Boliden shareholders for prospectus misrepresentation.  These
    actions were commenced in the wake of an environmental disaster at a zinc
    mine located in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region>

    Liberty, the motion judge determined that the pollution exclusion clause
    applied to some
    — but not all — of the losses arising from the allegations of misrepresentation
    against the directors and officers.  He concluded that the defence costs
    should be allocated in accordance with the defence costs allocation endorsement
    to the D&amp;O Policy (“allocation endorsement”).  Pursuant to the allocation
    endorsement, he awarded summary judgment in favour of Boliden for 80 per
    cent of the defence costs. </p>

    tailings pond<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    the fifth largest zinc producer in the western world once the Spanish mine
    reached specified 1998 production levels, and that Boliden’s production estimates

    company then moved for summary judgment against

    the motion for summary judgment, the material facts were not in dispute.  It
    was also not disputed that the insuring clause in the D&amp;O Policy covered
    the claim for defence costs in the class action litigation.  Boliden accepted
    for the purpose of the motion that the materials in the tailings pond were
    pollutants and that their escape when the dam collapsed would constitute
    pollution within the meaning of s. 28.15 of the policy.  The primary issue
    was the effect of the exclusion clause for “pollution loss”. </p>

    of the question before him, noting that “[n]one of the cases contained all
    of the same language as the exclusion clause in question or have facts comparable
    to this case” (at para. 22).  The question before him required “the consideration

    in paragraph 36 of the amended statement of claim.  He based this conclusion
    on the phrase “in any way involving, directly or indirectly” in the definition
    of
    “pollution loss”.  His conclusion is found in paragraph 35 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[35]     The sense that I take of the words “in
    any way involving” is that it means in any way tied to or concerned with.  The
    issue then becomes whether the amount to be paid for each claim of misrepresentation

    or concerned with, pollutants.</p>

    motion judge then went on to conclude that some of the allegations in paragraph
    36 do not involve, or are not tied to or concerned with, pollution loss while
    others are.  He found that those omitted material facts described in paragraphs
    36(a), (b), (c) and (d) “do not involve, nor are they tied to or concerned
    with, the actual or threatened seepage or discharge of pollutants”.  His
    view was that these omitted facts deal with the proper construction and maintenance,
    as well as the stability and structural defects of the dam.  Accordingly, “the
    amounts to be paid on account of these claims are not excluded from coverage”.  </p>

    motion judge found that the remaining alleged omitted material facts described
    in paragraphs 36(e) to (j) fall within the language and the definition of “pollution
    loss” because they relate to claims of actual and alleged seepage of pollutants.  He
    then, in paragraphs 38 and 39, framed the issue for his consideration in
    these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… whether it can be said that the amounts which
    the directors would become legally obligated to pay if these claims succeeded
    for the depreciation in value of the shares resulting from the misrepresentation
    could be said to directly or indirectly involve, be tied to or concerned
    with, such actual and alleged seepage of pollutants. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Can it be said that the drop in value of the Boliden
    shares as pleaded in the further amended statement of claim indirectly involves,
    or is tied to or concerned with, the actual or alleged escape of pollutants. … </p>

    of the Boliden shares can be said to directly involve, or be tied to or concerned
    with, the actual or alleged escape of pollutants.  Thus, he decided that
    the exclusion clause applies to some of the claims of misrepresentation but

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the motion judge proceeded on the basis that the exclusion clause excludes
    pollution-related losses, not pollution-related claims.  In doing so he held
    that the applicability of the exclusion clause requires a consideration of
    whether the allegations of wrongful acts or omissions on the part of the
    directors and officers in the statement of claim gave rise to both pollution
    loss and loss other than pollution loss.  He was correct. </p>

style='color:black'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching the conclusion he did, the motion judge had regard to the relevant
    principles of interpretation of an insurance contract.  He correctly noted
    that exclusion clauses should be strictly and narrowly interpreted against
    the insurer and where there are ambiguities, the reasonable expectations
    of the parties are to be given effect:  see <i>Amos v. Insurance Corp. of
    British Columbia</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 405 at 414;  <i>Derksen v. 539938 Ontario
    Ltd.</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 398 at paras. 52 and 57. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Boliden heavily relied on this court’s decision in <i>Zurich Insurance Co.
    v. 686234 Ontario Ltd.</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 447 in support of the non-application
    of the exclusion clause.  <span lang=EN>In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    <i>Zurich</i>, it was held that a pollution exclusion clause in a commercial

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge noted in paragraph 20, that in <i>Zurich</i>, if the insurer’s
    suggested interpretation of the exclusion clause were applied, “there would
    be little left for coverage of the insured’s business.”  Whereas, in this
    case, the D&amp;O Policy “covers a broad range of wrongful acts and a misrepresentation
    case involving underlying pollution problems would be but one of many claims
    that could fall within the policy”.   I agree with the motion judge;
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Zurich</i> is not determinative of the meaning to be given to the pollution
    exclusion clause in the D&amp;O Policy. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the applicable principles of interpretation support the conclusion
    that the exclusion clause in issue excludes pollution losses, as opposed
    to pollution-related claims.  In the words of the exclusion clause: “
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Liberty… shall not be liable under this policy to make any payment <i>for
    loss</i> respecting a claim…<i>for or in respect of a pollution loss</i>.” [Emphasis
    added.]   These words can be read as excluding pollution losses from coverage
    as opposed to all losses connected to a pollution-related claim.  Any ambiguity
    as to whether the clause excludes pollution-related losses or pollution-related
    claims should be resolved in favour of the insured. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the exclusion clause should be interpreted so as to give effect to the reasonable
    expectations of the parties.  The following language in the allocation endorsement
    expressly contemplates that a single claim may involve both a covered and
    uncovered loss:  “[i]n the event that a claim involves a loss that is covered
    by this policy and a loss or payment not covered by this policy…”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s approach to the applicability of the exclusion clause gives
    effect to the relevant principles of construction.  That is, it requires
    an assessment as to whether the allegations against the directors and officers
    in the amended statement of claim could lead to both covered and uncovered
    losses.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also not interfere with the motion judge’s conclusion that the loss
    arising from the alleged omissions in paragraphs 36(a) to (d) of the pleading
    was a covered loss.  The wrongful acts alleged in these paragraphs were capable
    of giving rise to liability irrespective of the dam collapse.  As Boliden
    observes in its factum, a mining company’s share price is affected by its
    ability to maintain estimated production volumes.  If mining were to be suspended
    because of structural problems with the tailings pond, production volumes
    could be affected even if the dam did not collapse. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, paragraph 37 of the pleading supports the conclusion that the liability
    of the officers and directors and the defence costs incurred on their behalf
    were related to allegations of misleading production estimates connected
    to undisclosed structural problems affecting the dam and not solely because
    of the dam collapse.  Paragraph 37 states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Further, the Production Estimates were misrepresentations
    in that they were untrue, inaccurate, misleading, and/or not realistically
    feasible in light of, <i>inter alia</i>, the facts listed in paragraph 36
