    charges arise out of sexual activity that the appellant engaged in at a motel
    with two girls aged fourteen and fifteen.  One of the complainants testified
    that the appellant had a camera with him and had taken pictures of the sexual
    activity.  The other testified that she had not seen a camera and had no
    recollection of pictures being taken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police searched the motel soon after and found no evidence of a camera.  They
    searched the appellant’s home three weeks later and seized a computer from
    his bedroom containing 442 images of child pornography.  None of those images
    were of the complainants.  There were over two thousand computer files of
    sexual material involving adults.  A video and a few images were of the appellant’s
    sexual activity with other adult females.</p>

    intelligible. </p>

    appellant points out that in his reasons regarding the making of child pornography
    count, the trial judge did not expressly state that the appellant’s testimony
    denying that he took pictures failed to raise a reasonable doubt.  However,
    the trial judge did explain why he accepted the evidence of the one complainant
    who testified that pictures were taken.  That evidence was extensive and
    detailed.  She saw images on the camera and had tried to delete them.  The
    trial judge referred to the evidence of the other complainant, who did not
    see or remember a camera, and pointed out she was more traumatized by the
    events.  The trial judge also considered the reservations he had expressed
    about the complainants’ testimony regarding the assault charges.  At the
    end of the day, he believed the complainant who saw a camera and images.  On
    the basis of her testimony, he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the pictures were taken.  This finding was open to him on the evidence. </p>

    the possession charge, the trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s testimony
    that he was unaware of the presence of child pornography on the computer
    and found that his evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt.  The appellant
    was the owner and primary user of the computer, which was in his bedroom.  The
    appellant acknowledged that thousands of other images on the computer were
    his.  On all of the evidence, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference
    that the appellant possessed the images.  </p>
