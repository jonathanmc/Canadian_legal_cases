    appellants were granted leave to appeal on the sole issue of whether they
    received a fair hearing before the appeal court below.  The matter apparently
    came before the appeal court judge when it was transferred from another court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellants requested an adjournment because of the late service of the respondent’s
    factum. The respondent opposed the adjournment. The appeal court judge advised
    the parties that he had not had a chance to read the material and asked counsel
    to inform him what the case was about with a view to determining whether
    an adjournment was warranted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    identified the issues and directed the judge to the passages of the decision
    and the evidence they considered pertinent.  At every juncture, the judge
    asked questions, then examined and considered the passages to which counsel
    directed him.  He verified he understood what were the issues, what evidence
    had been introduced and what the justice of the peace had decided on that
    evidence.  The judge then dismissed the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the broad contention of appellants’
    counsel that there is a miscarriage of justice in every case where the judge
    has not read the material prior to the hearing.  Certainly, judges should
    review the material filed before hearing a case.  However, in a busy court
    system it is inevitable that court lists, which often include both trials
    and appeals, may have to be split and cases transferred from one court to
    another, as happened here.  Even then, a judge should take the necessary
    time to review the material. Where that is not possible, the question becomes
    whether the judge, in effect, reviewed the material on the bench with the
    assistance of counsel.  On our reading of the transcript, that is what occurred
    in this case.  The judge ensured he understood the decision below, the salient
    evidence, the issues and the position of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is problematic here, however, is that the appeal court judge never did rule
    on the adjournment request and did not indicate to counsel that he was embarking
    on a consideration of the merits of the appeal.  Consequently, counsel could
    not have known they should make submissions on the merits, rather than merely
    in regard to the adjournment request.   After the appeal was dismissed, appellants’ counsel,
    who seems to have been taken by surprise, was refused the opportunity to
    speak further.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done.  We are satisfied
    that the process below did not have the appearance of a fair hearing and
    so allow the appeal. In holding that the appellants did not receive a fair
    hearing in the court below, we express no view on the merits of the appellants’ appeal
    from the decision of the justice of the peace. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of the appeal court judge is set aside, the matter is remitted to
    the appeal court and a new hearing is directed before a different judge.  </p>
