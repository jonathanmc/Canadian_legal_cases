    May 31, 1985 the appellant husband and respondent wife entered into a pre-nuptial
    agreement.  They married the following day.  Both parties had been married
    before and had houses over which they wanted to keep separate ownership.  After
    a seventeen-year marriage, the parties separated and the wife sought to set
    aside the contract.  Following a trial of the issue of whether the marriage
    contract is valid, Kennedy J. allowed the wife’s application and set aside
    the contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment set aside and a new trial
    of the issue ordered.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the marriage contract was that the parties agreed to keep all
    of their real and personal property separate, including property that they
    brought into the marriage and that each acquired during the marriage.  The
    agreement did not deal with spousal or child support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties gave conflicting versions of the circumstances under which the marriage
    contract was signed on May 31, 1985.  For example, each claimed the other
    was the author of the contract.  The trial judge found that the husband had
    prepared the contract, probably with some assistance from a lawyer, but that
    it was an amalgam of precedents.  The contract was signed at the constituency
    office of Murray Elston, a lawyer and member of the provincial legislature.  Mr.
    Elston’s evidence tended to support the wife’s version of events.  The trial
    judge accepted Mr. Elston’s evidence and rejected the husband’s evidence
    where it conflicted with the wife’s evidence.  Mr. Elston testified that
    he did not provide any legal advice to either party and was essentially there
    to witness the signatures because of his previous relationship with both
    of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wife said that she was rushed into signing the contract because the husband
    told her that it had to be signed before they married.  The marriage was
    to take place the next day and she was busy preparing for the event.  She
    did not read the contract and had not obtained independent legal advice.  She
    testified that she thought the contract dealt only with the homes that each
    owned.  The trial judge found that during the marriage the parties conducted
    their affairs in accordance with what the wife understood to be the terms
    of the contract, namely that they would keep their real property separate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wife testified that she did not get any financial disclosure from her husband.  She
    was aware that he was employed at Ontario Hydro and was paying into a pension.  She
    adduced no evidence of the existence of any assets that were not disclosed
    by the husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    contents of the marriage contract can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         <u>Background</u>:  The
    parties contemplate marriage and each desires to have their rights and obligations
    with respect to property during the marriage and after separation determined
    in accordance with the agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         <u>Agreement</u>:  The
    parties agree to be bound by the agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.         <u>Separate
      property</u>:  The parties retain sole ownership of their own property
      free from any claim by the other, including personal property and real
      estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.         <u>Family
      residence</u>:  Each party will pay the expenses in respect of their personal
      residences.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.         <u>Wills</u>:  The
    parties will maintain valid wills that are consistent with the terms of the
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>6.         <u>Property
      not to be Family Asset</u>:  Each party owns or may own with others their
      own separate property and neither will make a claim to possession of the
      other’s property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>7.         <u>The <i>Family
        Law Reform Act, 1978</i></u><i> </i>[S.O. 1978, c. 2]:   “All rights
        and obligations of the husband and wife, whether arising during marriage
        either before or after separation or upon and after divorce or annulment,
        including the rights and obligations of each of them with respect to:
        (a) possession of property, and (b) ownership in or division of property,
        are governed by this agreement which prevails over all provisions of
        [t]he <i>Family [Law] Reform Act, 1978</i> or any successor.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>8.         <u>Release
      of Rights to and Interest in Property</u>:  The parties release and discharge
      all rights that they have under the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> or any
      other legislation or successor legislation, to any property, which the
      other has or may acquire.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>9.         <u>Release

      under the <i>Succession Law Reform Act</i> [R.S.O. 1980, c. 488, as amended
      by R.S.O. 1990, c. 26] or any successor legislation in each other’s estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>10.       <u>Voluntary
      Bequests</u>:  The parties do not waive any right to receive insurance,
      pension or similar benefits to which they may be entitled by right of survivorship
      or to receive gifts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>11.       Each
    party is to be solely liable for any liens or encumbrances against their
    separate property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>12.       <u>Independent
      Legal Advice</u>:  “The husband and wife each acknowledge that he or she:  (a)
      has had independent legal advice; (b) understands his or her rights and
      obligations under this agreement; and (c) is signing this agreement voluntarily.”</p>

    my view, the trial judge erred in his approach to this case.  He made a number
    of errors that require that his judgment be set aside.  For example, he held
    as follows at para. 66:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The <i>Family
      Law Act</i> [R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3] allows parties to enter into contracts
      for the purpose of arranging their affairs but the Court should be hesitant
      to enforce these.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the law is to the contrary.  <span lang=DA>In <i>Hartshorne v. Hartshorne</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 550 at para. 9</span>, Bastarache J. speaking for the majority
    said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      authorities generally agree that courts should respect private arrangements
      that spouses make for the division of their property on the breakdown of
      their relationship. <i>This is particularly so where the agreement in question
      was negotiated with independent legal advice</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    again at paras. 36 and 67 of the same case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Conversely,
      in a framework within which private parties are permitted to take personal
      responsibility for their financial well-being upon the dissolution of marriage,
      courts should be reluctant to second-guess the arrangement on which they
      reasonably expected to rely.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Once
      an agreement has been reached, albeit a marriage agreement, the parties
      thereto are expected to fulfill the obligations that they have undertaken.
      A party cannot simply later state that he or she did not intend to live
      up to his or her end of the bargain…. However, in a framework within which
      private parties are permitted to take personal responsibility for their
      financial well-being upon the dissolution of marriage, courts should be
      reluctant to second-guess their initiative and arrangement, <i>particularly
      where independent legal advice has been obtained</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge accepted the wife’s evidence that she did not
    have independent legal advice.  Nevertheless, there is no presumption that
    the courts will be hesitant to enforce a pre-nuptial agreement.  The burden
    is on the party seeking to escape the effect of the agreement to show that
    there are grounds for setting it aside.  The lack of independent legal advice
    is a factor for the court to consider along with all the other circumstances.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)  The
      husband misrepresented when the contract must be signed</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regrettably,
    the trial judge’s reasons for setting aside the contract are far from clear.
    He appeared to identify several grounds for setting it aside.  First is the
    husband’s misrepresentation that to be valid the agreement had to be signed
    before the marriage.  The trial judge said this at para. 68: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>He is the one
    who told her that it had to be signed before the marriage or it would not
    be valid.  This is misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    misrepresentation is of concern because it imposed a time pressure upon the
    wife.  However, in contract law, a misrepresentation must be material in
    the sense that a reasonable person would consider it relevant to the decision
    to enter the agreement in question.  In addition, the material misrepresentation
    must have constituted an inducement to enter the agreement upon which the
    party relied: see <i>e.g. Panzer v. Zeifman </i>(1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 502
    (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Beer v. Townsgate I Ltd. </i>(1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 136 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge made no attempt to apply the law respecting misrepresentation
    and in particular made no finding that this misrepresentation was material
    to the wife’s decision to sign the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    some of the trial judge’s findings immediately after this part of his reasons
    suggest that this misrepresentation by the husband was not material, that
    it was always the intention of the parties to enter into a pre-nuptial agreement.
    For example, the trial judge said this at paras. 69-72:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The applicant
    knew and understood that she was signing an agreement to keep her real estate
    separate from her husband’s and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>She has some
    knowledge about marriage breakdown because she supported the respondent who
    had a similar experience with his first marriage and separation.  Also Mrs.
    Dougherty assisted her husband [in] champion[ing] the cause of male spouses
    in marriage breakdown situations, by composing and writing letters on her
    husband’s behalf to members of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Dougherty
    was a member of a group called Fathers for Justice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Letters to various
    members of Parliament which he and Mrs. Dougherty wrote were made exhibits
    and they reflect the couple’s special interest in this area of the law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the wife testified that they had discussed entering into a marriage contract
    even before they talked seriously of marriage.  There was never any question
    that they would enter into such an agreement.  As she said, “If Mr. Dougherty
    wanted to have a marriage contract, I wasn’t in objection with that because
    I did have a house with a similar sentimental value.”  Indeed, the parties
    had discussed the need to have the agreement signed before the wedding less
    than a week prior to their attendance at Mr.&nbsp;Elston’s office.  The wife
    was expecting to sign the contract very soon thereafter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also did not expressly find that the misrepresentation induced
    the wife to enter into the agreement and there was evidence contrary to any
    suggestion of inducement.  For example, Mr. Elston, whose evidence the trial
    judge accepted, testified that both parties appeared to come to the office
    voluntarily.  They appeared attentive to what they were doing while there
    and appeared to take the signing seriously.  He had no concerns that either
    party was uncomfortable about signing the document.  On cross-examination,
    the wife testified that she went to Mr. Elston’s office voluntarily and that
    she could have chosen not to go if she did not wish to as no one “twisted
    [her] arm” or forced her.  She further admitted that at the time of the signing
    she did not make any statement to the effect that she did not wish to sign,
    nor did she express concern or a desire for more time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    real complaint by the wife appears to be that she understood that the contract
    would only deal with their real estate whereas the agreement provides that
    all of the parties’ real and personal property would be kept separate.  However,
    this misunderstanding flowed from her failure to read the contract, or to
    read it carefully. It is not apparent how it can be said that the husband’s
    misrepresentation as to timing vitiated her ability to understand the contents
    of the contract.  She may have been distracted about the upcoming marriage
    and may have felt rushed but she nevertheless had the opportunity to read

    second basis for setting aside the agreement appears to be that the agreement
    did not provide for child or spousal support.  The trial judge said this
    at paras. 78, 155, 158 and 167:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Common sense
    dictates that the applicant would not have left her work and raised her family’s
    only child had she known that the agreement which she signed did not provide
    for support in any eventuality.  She simply did not understand the agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN> </span>As
    further evidence of this lack of care is the fact that the marriage contract
    is not exhaustive and does not provide for the eventuality of children.  It
    is certainly reasonably foreseeable that there could be children of this
    union despite preventative measures.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN> </span>A
    child, Steven, was born and the parties both have had to encroach upon their
    own assets to provide for proper child support.  The parties suggest that
    these assets were to be protected by the agreement.  The contract is therefore
    not suitable for the change of circumstances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I find in the
    circumstances that it cannot be said that the parties had an informed understanding

    there is no legal basis for setting aside an agreement dealing with property
    merely because it does not also deal with support, especially child support.  This
    agreement does not preclude the wife from applying for spousal and child
    support.  In fact, an agreement that is unfair when considered solely from
    the point of view of the division of property may be acceptable when spousal
    and child support is considered: see <i>Hartshorne</i> at paras. 51 and 64.  In
    any event, the terms of a domestic contract cannot override the court’s jurisdiction
    with respect to child support: see s. 15.1 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), and s. 56(1.1) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</p>

    the trial judge set aside the contract because it did not deal with child

    finding raises the question of the application of s. 56(4) of the <i>Family

    under that Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A court may,
    on application, set aside a domestic contract or a provision in it,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) if a party

    or other liabilities, existing when the domestic contract was made;</p>

    I agree with Granger J. in <i>Gregoric v. Gregoric</i> (1990) 4 O.R. (3d)
    588 (Gen. Div.) that s. 56(4) does not operate retrospectively to govern
    agreements made before the <i>Family Law Act </i>came into force: see also <i>Klinger

    26 R.F.L. (5th) 28 (S.C.J.).  Section 56(4)(b) is broader than the common

    unconscionability. </p>

    findings of the trial judge would not support setting aside the contract
    on common law grounds such as non est factum, duress or unconscionability.
    While the failure to understand the nature of the contract would be a basis
    for setting it aside at common law, the trial judge made no such finding.
    The wife knew she was signing a pre-nuptial agreement dealing with property.

    made before the agreement was signed. He said this at para. 162:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is the finding
    of this court that there was <u>no</u> reasonable financial disclosure between
    the parties when the contract was entered into in the nature of that contemplated

    a Hydro pension does not mean that she had a full actuarial appreciation
    of its value, and further, <i>that she may have had a significant interest

    difficulty with this finding is that there was no evidence that the husband
    failed to disclose significant assets.  As the trial judge pointed out, the
    wife knew that the husband had a pension from his employer but there was
    no evidence that the wife had a significant interest in it.</p>
