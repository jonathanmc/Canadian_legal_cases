  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents, Thomas Tiffin and F. Marc Holterman were the subjects of a complaint
    to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“RCMP”), which alleged that they had
    been involved in a complex scheme to defraud an American citizen of the sum
    of $100,000 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    ) through a “high yield investment” scam.  The RCMP decided not to pursue
    a criminal investigation and referred the matter to the Special Enforcement
    Program (“SEP”), a branch of the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the evidence was gathered by the CRA, the respondents were charged with the
    offences of making false or deceptive statements in their tax returns, tax
    evasion, and fraud.   The Supreme Court of Canada, in the meantime, released
    its decision in <i>R. v. Jarvis</i> (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 1, which holds
    that CRA officials must cease using their inspection and requirement powers
    once the predominant purpose of their inquiry shifts from the determination
    of tax liability to the determination of penal liability.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset of their trial, the respondents brought an application under s.
    24(2) of the <i>Charter </i>to exclude all of the evidence gathered by the
    CRA.  Relying on <i>Jarvis</i>, the respondents argued that the audit of
    Holterman had actually been a criminal investigation from the outset.  In
    addition, they argued that the search warrants should be quashed, on the
    basis that many of the statements contained in the Information to Obtain
    were derived from the improper use of the inspection and requirement powers,
    or were misleading. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that the use of the inspection and requirement powers by
    the auditor violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He also quashed the search
    warrants.   And finally, he ordered the Crown to pay costs to

    Tiffin and Holterman were business partners.  Together, they ran a company
    called Nissi Financial Corporation (“Nissi”) which was incorporated in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Panama</st1:country-region>
    .  Nissi’s primary purpose appears to have been to engage various companies
    and individuals around the world in “high-yield investment” programs in which
    large-scale investments would be made through Nissi on the expectation of
    considerable financial gains down the road.  </p>

    early 2000, the RCMP received a complaint about
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    Tiffin and Holterman.  Jeremy Sprague Sr., an American citizen, reported
    that

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tiffin and Holterman had defrauded his deceased son of $100,000 as part of
    one of these high-yield investment programs.  After concluding that there
    were insufficient grounds for a criminal investigation, the RCMP referred
    the case to the CRA because they thought the case might have tax implications. </p>

    Tiffin had been a non-filer and Holterman had reported only nominal amounts
    of income, ranging from a $6,000 loss to a gain of approximately $4,000.  The
    file was directed to SEP.  As of March 2000, Jorge Liviero was the auditor
    assigned to the file.  </p>

    worked covertly, inquiring into

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tiffin and Holterman’s financial affairs without contacting them directly.  He
    drove by Holterman’s house and inquired into the lease for a vehicle he saw
    parked there.  He also used his inspection powers under s. 231 of the <i>Income
    Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 (5th<sup> </sup>Supp.), c. 1 (the “<i>ITA</i>”)
    to request the production of numerous documents, including many documents
    from two banks regarding Holterman’s financial transactions. </p>

    also contacted several parties with whom
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tiffin and Holterman had done business.  Several of those parties reported
    having paid significant sums to Holterman without having received any returns.  One

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    reviewing his findings, Liviero concluded that large sums of money had been

    income.  After consulting with his supervisor he terminated the audit and
    in late November 2001 referred the file to the CRA’s Criminal Investigations
    unit, given the magnitude of the unreported sums, the possibility of additional
    unreported income, and the possibility of fraud. </p>

    Crown raises three issues on this appeal.  First, it argues that the trial
    judge erred in law in determining that the audit was a criminal investigation,
    and in concluding that the use of the inspection and requirement powers by
    Liviero violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Crown argues that his reasons
    for judgment fail to adequately explain how he reached his conclusion that
    the audit was actually an investigation, in the face of contradictory evidence
    and other findings of fact made by him.  In sum, the Crown argues that his
    reasons do not allow for appellate review and are marred by significant legal
    errors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown concedes that, in light of <i>Jarvis</i>, the use of the s. 231
    inspection and requirement powers by Fish violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. <i> </i>All
    information obtained by Fish through the <i>Charter </i>violation must, therefore,
    be excised from his Information to Obtain.  The Crown also concedes that,
    once that information is excised, the grounds remaining are insufficient
    to justify issuance of the warrants.  Accordingly, the Crown does not seek
    to uphold the warrants.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nevertheless,
    although the Crown does not seek to uphold the warrants, it submits that
    the trial judge erred in excluding evidence obtained as a result of those
    warrants.  Indeed, the Crown contends that the trial judge erred in excluding
    the evidence gathered by both Liviero and Fish through the inspection and
    requirement powers under the <i>ITA</i>.  </p>

    Tiffin his costs.  It argues that costs are typically not awarded in criminal
    matters and are reserved for cases of serious abuse by the Crown.  The trial

    issues one and two, but I would allow the appeal on issue three.  Regarding
    issues one and two, I am satisfied that the reasons for decision of the trial
    judge do allow for meaningful appellate review.  Moreover, the trial judge
    has not committed any error of law, and the Crown has not met its burden
    of demonstrating that he committed palpable and overriding error in his findings

    Crown does not contend that the judgment was prejudicial, unreasonable, unsupported
    by the evidence, or that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
    occurred.  Rather, it submits that the trial judge’s reasons are inadequate
    and do not allow for proper appellate review, especially on whether or not
    he misdirected himself on the applicable law.</p>
  <h2>First Issue - The Predominant Purpose</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s arguments in respect of this issue can be broken down into two parts:
    first, that the reasons for judgment are insufficient and do not allow for
    appellate review; and second, that the trial judge’s decision is marred by
    significant legal errors insofar as he misapplied the <i>Jarvis</i> factors.  I
    will address each of these arguments in order.</p>
  <h2><i>1)        Sufficiency of Reasons </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that the reasons of the trial judge are insufficient to permit
    an appellate court to exercise appellate review in a meaningful way.  It
    argues that the reasons fail to provide an intelligible pathway through the
    evidence and explain how the trial judge reached a conclusion.  I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test for sufficiency of reasons is now well established and is found in the
    reasons set out in <i>R. v. Sheppard </i>(2002)<span class=canliicitation><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>, 62 C.C.C. (3d) 298 where </span></span>the Supreme Court
    of Canada found that the reasons of the trial judge were insufficient because
    they were so generic they could apply to any criminal law case.  Simply put,
    that is not this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons in this case do more than provide a “boiler plate” decision.  Here
    the trial judge summarized the facts, set out the relevant law, and applied
    the law to the facts.  While his discussion applying the law to the facts
    is admittedly somewhat brief, it does not insulate the decision from appellate
    review.  Indeed, the reasons here were considerably more thorough than those
    in <i>Sheppard</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent the reasons are lacking, in my view when those reasons are combined
    with the record they do allow for meaningful appellate review.  The evidence
    here was straightforward and was neither confusing nor contradictory.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further
    regarding this issue, the Crown argues that the trial judge failed to adequately
    explain his conclusion that Liviero had conducted an investigation, which
    was outside of his mandate as an auditor.  It refers to passages from the
    hearing to demonstrate the trial judge’s confusion between the role of auditor
    and investigator, which the Crown alleges led him to reach an incorrect conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Using
    a trial judge’s utterances made during the hearing to interpret statements
    made in the decision is only helpful where there is ambiguity in the reasons
    for decision.  The statements made and questions asked by a trial judge during
    the hearing should not, as a general rule, supplement the content of the
    trial judge’s decision.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the reasons for decision are clear and are capable of review without
    any need to refer to the trial judge’s statements made during the hearing.  They
    explain and apply the relevant factors set out in <i>Jarvis</i>.  Moreover,
    the trial judge’s fifteen findings of fact show fairly clearly the basis
    of his determination that Liviero was not conducting an audit.  I would dismiss
    this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    more troublesome issue for me in this appeal is the alleged misapplication
    by the trial judge of the legal principles from <i>Jarvis</i>.</p>
  <h2><i>2)        The Jarvis Test<a name="_Toc188763564"></a></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that Liviero acted outside of his mandate as an auditor
    by conducting an investigation into the penal liability of Holterman.  In
    doing so, the Crown asserts that the trial judge committed three errors:
    (i) he found that Liviero was acting as an agent for investigations; (ii)
    he suggested that the evidence Liviero gathered was relevant only to penal
    liability; and (iii) he determined that Liviero had conducted an investigation
    from the outset because he had reasonable grounds to believe that Holterman
    had not reported income.  Once again I disagree. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>As
      I have already noted, in arriving at his conclusion the trial judge specifically
      referenced and then applied the factors set out in <i>Jarvis </i>to determine
      whether Liviero was conducting an investigation.  In other words, the trial
      judge applied the law to the facts as he found them; consequently, his
      analysis was one of mixed fact and law.  As the Supreme Court observed
      at para. 100 of <i>Jarvis</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Whether or not a given inquiry is auditorial or
    investigatory in nature is a question of mixed fact and law.&nbsp; It involves
    subjecting the facts of a case to a multi-factored legal standard and, accordingly,
    [the trial judge’s] finding is not immune from appellate review. [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    on appeal, as a matter of mixed fact and law, the Crown is required to demonstrate
    that the trial judge made a distinct legal error, or erred in his assessment
    of the evidence.  A legal error, such as the application of an incorrect
    standard, a failure to consider a required element of a legal test, or similar
    error in principle is subject to a standard of correctness.  Where the legal
    question cannot be separated from the facts, a trial judge’s decision is
    subject to a more stringent standard; that is, the trial judge’s interpretation
    of the evidence overall will not be overturned absent palpable and overriding
    error: <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that the legal error in the trial judge’s application of <i>Jarvis</i> is
    that he conflated the standard used to assess civil tax liability with the
    standard used to assess penal liability.  The Crown argues that the trial
    judge believed that any kind of inquiry into a taxpayer’s unreported income
    counts as an investigation; however, only inquiries into the taxpayer’s <i>mens
    rea </i>for the purposes of establishing criminal guilt count as investigation.  There
    are two difficulties with the Crown’s submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the Crown’s reliance on the trial judge’s statements made during the hearing
    is problematic and unpersuasive.  Such statements do not — as I have alluded
    to above — supplement the content of the decision and they are not necessarily
    indicative of the trial judge’s reasons.  The reasons in the decision in
    this case are clear and speak for themselves.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there is nothing in the trial decision to suggest that he confused the distinct
    concepts of audit versus investigation and their respective counterparts
    of civil liability and criminal liability.  The trial judge distinguished
    between these concepts throughout the judgment and never articulated the
    standard for assessing an investigation as any kind of inquiry into unreported
    income.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

      established that the trial judge did not make a legal error, I move on
      to consider whether he made an error of mixed fact and law.  As this court

      296:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The “palpable and overriding” standard demands strong
    appellate deference.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>. . . Examples of “palpable”
    factual errors include findings made in the complete absence of evidence,

    ascertaining whether the predominant purpose of a given inquiry is the determination
    of penal liability, <i>Jarvis</i> establishes that the trial judge in this
    case was required to assess the totality of circumstances and examine a number
    of factors, none of which are necessarily determinative on their own: <i>Jarvis</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 93-94.  The trial judge identified the issue before him as determining “whether
    or not an audit becomes an investigation”.  In deciding this question he
    described the approach he was taking:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… it is necessary to make findings of fact based
    upon [Liviero’s] testimony and all the other evidence in that regard.  After
    having established the facts, I must consider the factors set out in <i>Jarvis</i>.</p>

    interpretation of the evidence as a whole.  While the Crown identifies its
    concerns with the trial judge’s treatment of the factors in <i>Jarvis</i>,
    it has failed to meet its burden of proving a palpable and overriding error
    in the analysis. </p>

      approach, in my view, was correct.  To demonstrate, I propose to briefly
      review the critical factors below as well as the Crown’s objections to
      the trial judge’s analysis. </span></p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc188763568"><i>(a)       Was the general conduct consistent
        with a criminal investigation?</i></a><i></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that Liviero’s belief that Holterman was involved in fraudulently
    obtaining monies indicated that he was in pursuit of a criminal investigation.  The
    Crown, relying on <i>Jarvis</i>, argues that just because an auditor may
    suspect that an offence has been committed does not convert an audit into
    an investigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge’s finding of suspicion by Liviero on its own may not be sufficient
    to allow for the conclusion that he was conducting an investigation, combined
    with other evidence, the trial judge was entitled to use this finding in
    deciding whether the inquiry was an investigation.  A brief review of some
    of the evidence upon which the trial judge could have relied will illustrate
    this. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on the evidence at trial, the trial judge found that “the hallmark of an
    audit is that the auditor and the subject get together.”  And, as a CRA witness
    testified, audits need to be “open and transparent”.  In this case, Liviero,
    over a period of almost two years, conducted his activities without once
    meeting with the subject, Holterman.  Moreover, the evidence was that Liviero
    chose a covert approach, which was more characteristic of an investigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Liviero’s
    approach included driving by Holterman’s residence, credit bureau checks,
    share searches, CPIC and PIRS<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    interviews about fraud.  Liviero himself admitted that what he was conducting
    was “considerably different” from the type of audit described to the public
    by CRA.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout
    the period that Liviero had the file, he referred to himself as a member
    of the Investigations Division.  At times he referred to himself as a “SEP
    Auditor/Investigator” and at times as a “SEP Investigator”.  He never referred
    to himself as a “SEP Auditor” or as an “Auditor”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Coupled
    with the evidence, the trial judge also considered the dishonesty of Liviero
    and fourteen other findings and conclusions, which he relied on to decide
    this factor.  In the end, the trial judge’s reliance on Liviero’s belief
    is not in conflict with the evidence, or made in the complete absence of
    evidence and so does not reveal a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc188763569"><i>(b)       Was the auditor acting as an agent

    trial judge found that in the circumstances of this case, such as Liviero’s
    close proximity to investigations, there was evidence that Liviero was acting
    as an agent of investigations.  The Crown argues that the mere fact that
    Liviero’s desk was near to Fish’s desk does not mean that the former was
    acting as an agent of the latter.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, taken in isolation the Crown’s argument might have more force.  However,
    the trial judge clearly did not simply rely on proximity alone in reaching
    his decision.  Indeed, the trial judge was careful to characterize their
    close proximity as just one example of why Liviero was collaborating with
    investigations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      was sufficient evidence upon which the trial judge could make this finding.  It
      is not a palpable and overriding error to rely on their proximity as some

      of the other.  </span></p>

    the fact that Liviero initially sought to obtain, through the use of requirements,
    banking records relating to Holterman’s accounts, which were relevant to
    the determination of Holterman’s tax liability as evidence of unreported
    income.  These banking records, the Crown says, were relevant in assessing
    both civil and penal liability, and so it cannot be said that Liviero only
    used them to inquire into the latter. </p>

    to the determination of both kinds of liability; however, the trial judge’s
    experience with the evidence led him to believe that these records were sought
    strictly for the determination of criminal liability.  He found “on the basis
    of the information contained in the Red Book that there was no information
    before Liviero to commence an audit of Holterman as a taxpayer.”  </p>

      that the inquiry into the banking records was not for the purposes of conducting
      an audit.  That is, he did not commit a palpable and overriding error in
      finding the evidence Liviero collected was intended for a determination
      of criminal guilt.  The trial judge was entitled to make the finding he

    trial judge explained that the covert nature of Liviero’s inquiry suggested
    that he was acting as an investigator and not an auditor.  His conclusion
    is based on one of the exhibits, which describes an audit as a process of
    cooperation, openness and transparency between the auditor and the audited
    person.  Given that Liviero’s actions were anathema to the transparent process
    of the audit, the trial judge found that his actions did not reflect an audit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    Crown argues that the trial judge based his conclusion on neutral circumstances
    that could support either the conclusion that Liviero had conducted an audit
    or an investigation.  More specifically, the Crown suggests that the covert
    nature of the operation does not necessarily render it an investigation because
    covert operations are wholly consistent with the character of an audit.  Respectfully,
    this submission has no merit.  It is not enough to show that the evidence
    relied upon is equivocal; rather the Crown has the heavy burden of showing
    a palpable and overriding error in the trial judge’s assessment, and in this
    case failed to show why it was a plain and obvious error to regard the conduct
    as an investigation.</p>

      trial judge, during twenty days of hearing, heard from a number of witnesses
      who specifically testified at length as to the difference between an audit
      and an investigation.  Moreover, the core issue of the hearing was to decide
      this very fact.  To submit that the trial judge, after having listened
      to this evidence, then conflated these concepts is unmerited.  In my view,
      this is a case where the trial judge’s interpretation and conclusions of
      the evidence — all of which he was entitled to make — are at complete odds
      with those of the Crown.  This appeal appears to me to simply amount to
      an attempt to retry this case.</span>   </p>

    the end, the trial judge concluded that Liviero conducted an investigation
    instead of an audit.  In doing so, he relied heavily on the covert nature
    of Liviero’s operations, the fact that there was no information before Liviero
    to commence an audit of Holterman as a taxpayer, and Liviero’s belief from
    the outset that Holterman was involved in fraudulent activity.  </p>

      the trial judge also discredited Liviero as a witness: he found that Liviero

    to the court when he testified that he had conducted an audit.  All of these
    pieces of evidence taken together support the trial judge’s conclusion that
    Liviero had wrongfully conducted an investigation.  In interpreting the evidence
    overall, the Crown has failed to show how the trial judge made a palpable
    and overriding error.  I would not, therefore, interfere with his ruling.</span></p>
  <h2>Second Issue - Exclusion of the Evidence</h2>

    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> requires that in deciding whether or not evidence
    obtained through a breach of the <i>Charter</i> should be excluded at trial,
    a court is to determine whether, “having regard to all the circumstances,
    the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute.”  To determine disrepute a court weighs three factors:
    (i) the admission of the evidence on the fairness of the trial; (ii) the
    seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violation; and (iii) the effect of excluding
    the evidence on the administration of justice (<i>R. v. Collins</i>, (1987),
    3 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)). </p>

    court will defer to a trial judge’s ruling under s. 24(2) unless there is
    an identifiable error in principle, a material misapprehension of the evidence
    relevant to the ruling, or a clearly unreasonable conclusion.&nbsp;  It is
    in these circumstances that this court may perform the s. 24(2) calculation
    afresh and determine the admissibility of the evidence:&nbsp;<i>R. </i><i>v.&nbsp;Harris</i>,&nbsp;2007

    I understand the Crown’s submissions, it argues again that the trial judge’s
    reasons fail to allow for meaningful appellate review of this issue because
    of their brevity.  That is, because of the inadequacy of reasons, there is
    an inability to determine whether the trial judge properly applied the three <i>Collins</i> factors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, while it is agreed that trial fairness is not at issue in this
    case since the evidence was non-conscriptive, the Crown argues that when
    the second and third branches of the <i>Collins</i> test are properly considered,
    the trial judge should have admitted all the evidence gathered by both Liviero
    and Fish.  The Crown asserts that the trial judge erred in his analysis of
    the seriousness of the breach and in finding that Liviero and Fish did not
    act in good faith.  </p>

  <h2><i>1)        Sufficiency of Reasons </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, the trial judge’s reasons for excluding the evidence under s. 24(2)
    are indeed very brief.  And, it is true that he does not specifically allude
    to the <i>Collins</i> factors nor does he specifically reference them in
    his reasons.  Nevertheless, when his reasons are read in their entirety,
    it becomes abundantly clear why he ruled to exclude the evidence.  And, in
    my view, he does not run afoul of the law in doing so and is, in this case,
    consistent with the <i>Collins</i> analysis. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      essence of why he excluded the evidence can be found in the following passage
      from his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the circumstances of this case, I have found
    serious misconduct on the part of the [officials of the Crown]; to admit
    the evidence obtained by way of such conduct would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    making his s. 24(2) decision, the trial judge added that there were “many
    more incidents of misconduct which I have not included in my reasons.”  In
    other words, the trial judge found the breaches of the <i>Charter</i> to
    be serious, and for that reason excluded the evidence.  He was entitled to
    do so and his decision is not unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    strict mechanical application of the <i>Collins</i> analysis is not, in itself,
    fatal to a trial judge’s decision on the exclusion or admission of evidence
    under s. 24(2)<span lang=EN style='color:black;'>. </span> In fact, the jurisprudence
    and the wording of s. 24(2) support a flexible multi-factored approach, rather
    than strict adherence to any formula that may result in automatic exclusion
    of evidence: see <i>R. v.</i> <i>Stillman</i>, (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321
    at para. 234 (S.C.C.).  Thus, the argument that a trial judge has not specifically
    followed the analysis or expressly considered the three enumerated <i>Collins</i> factors
    is not dispositive of the application of s. 24(2) by a trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    takes me then to the trial judge’s reason for excluding the evidence, namely,
    the seriousness of the breach.  <span style='color:black;'>Because trial
    fairness is not an issue, I propose to examine his reasons and the record
    as they relate to factors two and three of the <i>Collins</i> analysis.</span></p>
  <h2><i>2)        Seriousness of the Breach</i></h2>

    an analysis of the seriousness of the breach of state officials, a number
    of factors are engaged including whether the breach was committed in good
    or bad faith.  <span lang=EN>As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in <i>R.
    v. Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 512, the seriousness of the
    conduct of state officials depends on “whether it was committed in good faith,
    or was inadvertent or of a merely technical nature, or whether it was deliberate,
    wilful or flagrant.” </span>Other factors include <span
lang=EN>whether there was any urgency for the state officials to act in the manner
    that they did and the individual’s expectation of privacy in the area searched:
    see <i>R. v. Buhay </i>(2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 52 (S.C.C.).&nbsp; </span></p>

lang=EN>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that Liviero and Fish were acting in good faith.  It submits
    that since the policy of the CRA at the time was that requirements could
    be used to gather information up to the point that charges were laid, Liviero
    and Fish should not be deemed to have been acting in bad faith.  It adds
    that the evidence at issue was gathered at a time when <i>Jarvis </i>had
    yet to be decided and the law concerning the ambit of the inspection and
    requirement powers under the <i>ITA </i>was uncertain. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      disagree.  </span>I will refer to the findings of the trial judge that

      faith. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge demonstrates Liviero’s bad faith by pointing to his false
    testimony.  The trial judge found that he knew he was conducting an investigation
    from the outset and “told a deliberate lie to the court” when he testified
    that he was conducting an audit.  He found that Fish knew Liviero was conducting
    an audit from the outset and in this regard deliberately misled the justice
    who issued the search warrant.  Indeed, the trial judge found that Fish’s
    Information to Obtain regarding the search warrants contained “fraudulent,
    false and grossly misleading” information.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>I
      can find no basis upon which to interfere with the findings of the trial
      judge either as they relate to the level of conduct or the seriousness
      of the breach.  They are supported by both the evidence and the record
      and are findings which he was wholly entitled to make and to which he is
      owed deference.  As this court recently reminded in <i>R. v. Harrison</i>,
      2008 ONCA 85, trial judges are owed considerable deference in their decisions
      to include or exclude evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  As
      the majority decision explained in para. 33:</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='color:black'>Trial judges are in this preferred position because they
      have more direct contact with the public and with the people involved in
      the criminal justice process than appellate judges.&nbsp; On a regular
      basis, trial judges sitting in criminal courts hear from victims, accused
      persons, witnesses, police officers, defence counsel and frontline prosecutors.&nbsp;
    They have an opportunity to observe firsthand the way the criminal justice
    system is functioning and are well positioned to make assessments about the
    broad range of issues on which appellate courts are required to show deference.</span>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown’s reliance on the fact that <i>Jarvis</i> had yet to be decided
    at the time of the impugned conduct is of little assistance to any assertion
    of good faith.  The Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal <i>Jarvis</i> on
    May 17, 2001 and the companion case of <i>R. v. Ling</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R.
    814 on June 14, 2001.  Once leave to appeal was granted in both these cases,
    it had to have been known to CRA officials and the Department of Justice
    that serious constitutional issues concerning the propriety of using ss.
    231.1 and 231.2 of the <i>ITA</i> in aid of a criminal investigation were
    under consideration by the Supreme Court of Canada.  As Trotter J. noted
    on this same submission in <i>R. v. Chen</i>, 2007 ONCJ 177 at paras. 50,
    58, “this warranted some caution in the use of Requirements in the interim,
    especially … when there appeared to have been no urgency.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>However,
      in this case, rather than exercise some caution the CRA continued to use
      requirements in aid of investigations into penal liability knowing that
      the constitutionality of s. 231.2 of the <i>ITA</i> was under consideration
      in the Supreme Court of Canada.&nbsp; There was no urgency that militated
      against an exercise of caution in these circumstances. </span></p>

      noted, the individual’s expectation of privacy in the area searched affects
      the seriousness of the breach.  In this case, while the privacy interest
      of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tiffin and Holterman is low, it is not non-existent and does not undermine
    the seriousness of the breach.  </span><span style='color:black'>Their privacy
    interest, even if reduced, was, as the trial judge found, unlawfully and
    intentionally violated by very serious misconduct.</span> <span> </span> </p>

      the end, the trial judge found that both Liviero and Fish deliberately
      conducted an investigation into penal liability under the guise of conducting
      an audit.  Their conduct in doing so included dishonesty, deliberate fabrication,
      and a negligent understanding of their statutory authority.  Given these
      findings, the trial judge was entitled to find that the s. 8 <i>Charter</i> breaches
      were serious</span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>. </span></p>

      the conduct of Liviero and Fish was so egregious that it simply could not
      be condoned in any fashion.  By way of illustration, as he was concluding
      his reasons, the trial judge observed:</span></p>

      of the evidence to the case (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Harrison</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 49).  The trial judge in this case

      compounded all of this by being dishonest with the court.  In light of
      this, the trial judge, in my view, was completely entitled to exclude the

Tiffin and Holterman argue that an award of costs under s. 24(1),     <span style='"Times New Roman"'>where
an individual claims costs because of a breach of his or her <i>Charter</i> rights, goes

    “rare” or “unique” that “must at least result in something akin to an extreme

      on April 10, 2007, Moldaver J.A. dismissed the motion to quash the appeal
      as abandoned by Holterman.  Thus, this issue has already been dealt with.  Second,
      most, if not all, the evidence Holterman advances could have been entered
      into evidence by him during the trial.  The “new” evidence, in my view,
      fails to meet the <i>Palmer</i> criteria: <i>R. v. Palmer</i> (1979), 50
      C.C.C. (2d) 193.  And finally, Holterman’s allegations of fraud and prejudice

    J.A. would defer to the trial judge's conclusion that the auditor Liviero
    had
    “from the outset” conducted an investigation into the penal liability of
    Holterman. Determining when an inquiry made by the CRA has evolved from a
    regulatory audit to a penal investigation is largely fact driven and is based
    on an assessment of the totality of all the circumstances and context. The
    trial judge is obviously best positioned to make the assessment, and, in
    the absence of legal error, his conclusion is deserving of deference. My
    colleague has persuasively set out this view.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

    also take a different view of the degree of deference required. The Supreme
    Court stated that finding whether the purpose of a given inquiry is the investigation
    of penal liability is not immune from appellate review because it involves
    subjecting the facts of the case to a multi-factored legal standard.<i> </i>In <i>Jarvis</i> the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the Supreme Court considered at what point information collected under the
    inspection powers under ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985 (5th<sup> </sup>Supp.), c. 1 (the “<i>ITA</i>”) could no longer
    be used for a criminal prosecution<i>.</i> It is unnecessary to set out these
    lengthy provisions.<i> </i>They provide the CRA with extensive powers to
    audit taxpayers' returns and inspect all relevant records. They also impose
    on taxpayers the reciprocal obligation to maintain and produce books and
    records. I refer to these powers as “the inspection and requirement powers”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is settled law that the CRA’s use of the inspection and requirement powers
    to compel taxpayers to provide evidence for the purpose of enforcing regulatory
    compliance of the <i>ITA</i> does not violate the <i>Charter</i>’s guarantee
    against self-incrimination.<i> </i>As well, to enforce regulatory compliance,
    the CRA may use those powers to collect information from third-party sources
    without warrant without offending the taxpayer's right to a fair trial. Information
    collected under the inspection and requirement powers for regulatory purposes
    may be used in a subsequent criminal prosecution if one eventually takes
    place.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before<i> Jarvis</i>,
    the Supreme Court recognized that the broad inspection and requirement powers
    are indispensable to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    's tax system, which is based on self-assessment and self-reporting. Governments
    need tax revenues to operate and to provide facilities, services and programs
    to the public. The<i> ITA</i> is
    “essentially a regulatory statute”, “essentially of an administrative nature”: <i>R.
    v. McKinlay Transport Ltd.</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627 at 641 and 650. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court did not retreat from its classification of the<i> ITA</i> as
    essentially a regulatory statute in<i> Jarvis</i>. The court rejected the
    submission that the<i> ITA</i> was a
    “dual-purpose statute”. The Court stated, at paragraph 62, “In sum, the<i> ITA</i> is
    a regulatory statute, but non-compliance with its mandatory provisions can
    in some cases lead to criminal charges being laid.” The Supreme Court also
    reiterated its view that the broad inspection and requirement powers are
    necessary to achieve the important statutory objective of raising tax revenues
    for public purposes. </p>
  <h2>The Predominant Purpose Test in <i>Jarvis</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the Supreme Court provided the test for determining when a taxpayer can claim <i>Charter</i> protection
    during scrutiny by CRA officials. Taxpayers are protected by the <i>Charter</i> when
    the predominant purpose of an official's inquiry is the determination of
    penal liability.<i> </i>There are two significant aspects of this test that
    the trial judge failed to appreciate. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the words “predominant purpose” are key to the proper application of the
    test. The trial judge understood his task as deciding whether Liviero was
    “investigating” or “auditing”.<i> </i>The test, however, does not depend
    on what word best describes the inquiry, but rather on the purpose of the
    inquiry. What matters is whether the predominant purpose of the inquiry is
    to further criminal prosecution. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the Supreme Court did talk about the distinction between an audit and an
    investigation. However, it used these words as labels to differentiate between
    an inquiry related to taxpayer civil liability and an inquiry to determine
    penal liability.<i> </i>As the trial judge noted auditors and investigators
    do many of the same things.<i> </i>At paragraph 87 of <i>Jarvis</i>, the
    Supreme Court itself speaks of an “investigation” into tax liability.<i> </i>Nevertheless,
    focusing on the labels
    “audit” and “investigation” without keeping in mind the “predominant purpose”
    of the inquiry confuses the proper application of the <i>Jarvis</i> test.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did use the words “predominant purpose” once in his conclusions.
    He found that the predominant purpose of a particular inquiry that Liviero
    made was criminal investigation. I will explain later why that single finding
    cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second significant aspect of the test is that it is not a matter of choosing
    between two evenly balanced alternatives: whether the predominant purpose
    of the inquiry is penal investigation or whether the predominant purpose
    of the inquiry is regulatory enforcement. The test is one-sided. The task
    is to determine whether the predominant purpose of the inquiry is the determination
    of penal liability of the taxpayer. The Supreme Court articulated the test
    in this way repeatedly (paras. 2, 88, 93, 96, 98):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[2]  While taxpayers are statutorily bound to co-operate
    with CCRA auditors for tax assessment purposes (which may result in the application
    of regulatory penalties), there is an adversarial relationship that crystallizes
    between the taxpayer and the tax officials when the predominant purpose of
    an official's inquiry is the determination of penal liability.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[88]  [W]here the predominant purpose of a particular
    inquiry is the determination of penal liability, CCRA officials must relinquish
    the authority to use the inspection and requirement powers … </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[93]  In our opinion, the following list of factors
    will assist in ascertaining whether the predominant purpose of an inquiry
    is the determination of penal liability.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[96]  [W]hen the predominant purpose of a question
    or inquiry is the determination of penal liability, the “full panoply” of <i>Charter</i> rights
    are engaged for the taxpayer's protection. … CCRA officials conducting inquiries,
    the predominant purpose of which is the determination of penal liability,
    do not have the benefit of the ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) requirement powers.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[98]  In summary, wherever the predominant purpose
    of an inquiry or question is the determination of penal liability, criminal
    investigatory techniques must be used. As a corollary, all <i>Charter</i> protections
    that are relevant in the criminal context must apply.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    result of structuring the test in this way is that the CRA is entitled to
    use the inspection and requirement powers of the <i>ITA</i> until the finding
    is made that the predominant purpose of the inquiry is to establish the criminal
    guilt of the taxpayer. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    a trial judge should resolve any uncertainty in favour of CRA’s continued
    recourse to the inspection and requirement powers. It must be apparent that
    the predominant purpose is criminal investigation before the <i>Charter</i> is
    engaged. The Supreme Court said at paragraph 99 of <i>Jarvis</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When, in light of all relevant circumstances, it
    is apparent that CCRA officials are not engaged in the verification of tax
    liability,&nbsp;but are engaged in the determination of penal liability under
    s. 239, the adversarial relationship between the state and the individual
    exists. As a result, Charter protections are engaged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    understand from this comment that if the matter is at all uncertain, one
    cannot conclude the CRA’s statutory right to use the powers has been displaced.
    Put another way, taxpayers are protected by the <i>Charter</i> when it is
    apparent the investigation of criminal tax offences is underway.</p>

    would conclude that the trial judge erred by not applying the correct test.
    The trial judge completed his analysis with the conclusion: “In the end,
    I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities that Liviero commenced an investigation
    from the outset and that his use of requirements to obtain information on
    the bank records constitute a breach of Holterman's rights under Sec. 8 of
    the Charter.”<i> </i>When read in the context of his reasons, this passage
    indicates that the trial judge was satisfied the test was met merely by characterizing
    Liviero’s behaviour as “investigating” without maintaining a steady focus
    on the “predominant purpose” of his inquiries. </p>

    whether the predominant purpose of an inquiry is the investigation of penal
    liability is not an easy task because much of the information sought for
    audit inquiries and for criminal investigations under the <i>ITA</i> is the
    same. A comparison of the civil and penal offences created by the <i>ITA</i> illustrates
    this. Subsection 163(2) creates the civil offence of filing a false statement <span

    can be seen, these two provisions of the <i>ITA </i>are close cousins. The
    proscribed conduct is defined by the same language. Both apply to the act
    of making a false statement in a tax return. The use of the word “knowingly” in
    s. 163(2) makes relevant the mental state of the taxpayer to the regulatory
    offence, just as the implicit <i>mens rea</i> in s. 239(1)(<i>a</i>) is relevant
  to the penal offence.</p>

    of these four provisions demonstrates the considerable overlap in the elements
    of the civil and criminal offences created by the <i>ITA</i>. It follows
    that inquiries into whether the elements of the regulatory offences are established
    would be relevant to criminal culpability as well. The evidence to sustain

    the overlapping content of the regulatory and penal tax offences and the

    proceed against the taxpayer civilly or criminally. The Supreme Court addressed
    the existence of this discretion when it said at paragraph 89:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this regard, courts must guard against creating
    procedural shackles on regulatory officials; it would be undesirable to “force

    the <i>Jarvis</i> test. The discretion may be exercised on the basis of the
    amount of unpaid tax involved, rather than on whether the information being

    file that’s assigned to me within SEP, that’s the reason why it's there,
    because there is either proven or believed possible involvement in criminal
    activity.” He stated that Liviero was motivated to act, in part, because
    of the allegations of fraud in the RCMP referral, which he accepted as true.
    He also said that “Liviero believed from the outset that Holterman was involved
    in fraudulently obtaining monies and that he commenced investigating Holterman
    as the person who fraudulently deprived Jerome Sprague’s son of the $100,000.” He
    remarked that “Liviero was aware at the outset that a ‘scam’ was alleged
    and when he referred the file to investigations, his referral was in respect
    of an allegation of fraud.” The trial judge found as a fact “that Liviero
    commenced an investigation because Liviero believed that Holterman was involved

    observations all relate to Liviero's suspicion that the respondents were
    engaged in criminal activity other than criminal tax offences. The RCMP abandoned
    its investigation of the suspected commercial fraud. That investigation was
    never resurrected. Liviero was not concerned with and never occupied himself
    with the suspicions the RCMP had relating to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Tiffin and Holterman’s involvement in defrauding investors.  Rather, his
    assignment was to audit Holterman for unreported income and, in so doing,

    file, like every other file referred under the Working Arrangements, involved
    either proven or believed possible involvement in some sort of criminal activity.
    Quite naturally Liviero was aware that Holterman was alleged to be involved
    in a scam. Specifically, he knew the RCMP suspected Holterman of defrauding
    Jerome Sprague's son of $100,000. Yes, Liviero was motivated to act because
    of the RCMP's allegations of commercial fraud. After gathering information,
    Liviero did indeed refer the file to Criminal Investigations in respect of
    an allegation of fraud, but that was a fraud on the Canadian public by the
    evasion of taxes and not the commercial fraud against private investors that
    the RCMP initially suspected. </p>

    trial judge’s observations about Liviero’s suspicions of Holterman’s criminal
    activity, while true, do not assist the analysis. The question is whether
    the predominant purpose of Liviero's use of the inspection and requirement
    powers was the gathering of information for a criminal prosecution of the
    respondents for tax related offences. The RCMP referral, with its allegations
    of other criminal activity, is not germane to that question.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    ur audit process involves establishing a relationship based on co-operation,
    openness, and transparency–key factors in ensuring an efficient audit.” The
    appellants' counsel used this document to submit that unless the auditor
    contacted the taxpayer at the outset and worked openly and cooperatively
    with the taxpayer, the process was not an audit but an investigation. The
    dictionary defined audit as “an official inspection of an organization’s
    accounts typically by an independent body.”</p>

    explained above in the discussion of the <i>Jarvis</i> test, the question
    is not whether the manner in which the CRA official’s conduct is best described
    by the word “audit” or by the word “investigation”. An examination of the
    Supreme Court’s characterization of the auditor's conduct in <i>Jarvis</i> demonstrates
    that covertness, surreptition and subterfuge designed to inculpate the taxpayer
    are acceptable conduct in the regulatory enforcement of the <i>ITA</i>.<i> </i>Despite
    what was said on the CRA webpage, which was not adopted by any witness, CRA
    officials do not have to establish a cooperative, transparent, and open relationship
    with taxpayers in the regulatory enforcement of the <i>ITA</i>. This is especially
    true for CRA officials working in the SEP who are inquiring into the unreported
    income of suspected criminals.  The test for all CRA officials is whether
    the predominant purpose of their inquiry is the determination of the penal
    liability of the taxpayer. An examination of the facts in <i>Jarvis</i> makes
    this clear.</p>

    early in 1994 the tax department received an anonymous letter suggesting

    taxation years by selling his deceased wife's art. An auditor began to look
    into the matter on February 16, 1994. While she immediately sent him a letter
    notifying him that an audit was in progress, she began to make inquiries
    before hearing from him. In fact, she deliberately did not return his telephone
    calls when he tried to reach her. She began to use the inspection and requirement
    powers to obtain information from third-party sources without “getting together” with
    the taxpayer.<i> </i>Unbeknownst to Mr. Jarvis, she obtained purchase invoices
    and cancelled cheques from nine art galleries that showed he had significant
    revenues in 1990 and 1991.<i> </i>By comparing that information with his
    tax returns she had already concluded that the anonymous complaint had some
    validity before she spoke to him directly.</p>

    the auditor reached this conclusion, one could say she had a reasoned suspicion
    that Mr. Jarvis had committed the criminal offence of making a false statement
    on his tax return contrary to s. 239(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>ITA</i>. The
    auditor, however, continued making inquiries relating to the regulatory offence
    of knowingly making a false statement on a tax return under s.163(2). </p>

    April 11, the auditor met with Mr. Jarvis at his home accompanied by her
    supervisor. She misled him about the supervisor's identity. She did not caution
    Mr. Jarvis as to his rights. She made extensive inquiries about his art sales,
    again without disclosing that she had already confirmed his actual revenues
    with information obtained from the art galleries. Mr. Jarvis did not initially
    disclose the existence of a bank account the auditor knew about. He acknowledged
    it when she asked about it. She had him sign a bank authorization for the
    account and had him produce other documentation that would help show he had
    unreported income.</p>

    is difficult to conceive how the auditor would have pursued a criminal investigation
    any differently. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court found the purpose of the
    auditor’s inquiries leading up to and at the April 11 meeting was to establish
    civil tax liability.<i> </i> The Supreme Court noted the auditor's conduct
    appeared deceptive and that she did mislead Mr. Jarvis and his accountant
    on several occasions.<i> </i>Nevertheless, “she did not use misleading tactics <u>in
    order to obtain information</u> under ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) for the purpose
    of advancing an investigation into penal liability” (para. 101, emphasis
    in original). The Supreme Court even noted that, at the April 11 meeting,
    the auditor was seeking to confirm her suspicion that tax evasion may have
    occurred, but found her goal in making her inquiries was to determine whether
    to refer the file to Special Investigations.<i> </i>The Court said “[t]here
    is no suggestion that she was seeking information to be used in an eventual
    prosecution” (para. 103).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indisputably,
    the <i>Jarvis</i> auditor did not establish a relationship with the taxpayer
    based on cooperation, openness and transparency.<i> </i>Moreover, she collected
    a great deal of information from third-party sources before she “got together”
    with the taxpayer.<i> </i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view the trial judge in this case addressed the wrong question.<i> </i>The
    trial judge considered whether Liviero comported himself as an “auditor”,
    rather than focusing on whether the predominant purpose of his inquiries
    was the determination of penal liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing
    that Liviero did approached the level of surreptitious inquiry of third-party
    sources made by the auditor in the<i> Jarvis</i> case, the incriminating
    interview style she used, or her active deception of Mr. Jarvis as to whether
    he was being investigated.<i> </i>Liviero simply went about collecting information
    that helped show the respondent’s income was considerably higher than reported.<i> </i>There
    is no evidence that he was seeking information to be used in an eventual
    prosecution of penal tax offences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor
    (b), as I understand it in the context of the <i>Jarvis</i> judgment as a
    whole, addresses whether the general conduct of the authorities is consistent
    with the pursuit of a criminal investigation and inconsistent with an audit
    relating to regulatory enforcement. I would find there was no evidence to
    support a finding that factor (b) was satisfied. </p>
  <h3>Factor (c) -- Had the auditor transferred his or her files and materials
    to the investigators?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    assessing the information he had obtained using the inspection and requirement
    powers, Liviero, in consultation with his supervisor, decided that the audit
    should be terminated and the matter referred to Criminal Investigations.
    Liviero transferred his file to Criminal Investigations on<span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'> </span>November 27, 2001. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    my view, <i>Jarvis</i> indicates that when the file is formally transferred
    for criminal investigation is crucial in determining whether the predominant
    purpose of the inquiry is penal liability. The transfer clearly indicates
    a subjective intent that a criminal investigation begin. Nevertheless, the
    Supreme Court explained that even the formal transfer to Criminal Investigations
    may not be enough. After all, the file could be sent back, and if so, the
    court must consider whether the investigators genuinely declined to take
    up the case, or if they sent the file back for the auditor to obtain further
    evidence for the prosecution of criminal offences. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the auditor did not transfer her files to Criminal Investigations until after
    she had received much information from third-party sources and from Mr. Jarvis
    himself. She continued making inquiries long after suspecting tax evasion,
    and as noted above, she made inquiries seeking to confirm that suspicion.
    It was only after she had calculated there was a discrepancy of some $700,000
    between his earned and reported income over the two taxation years that she
    decided not to complete the audit and instead, on May 4, 1994, referred her
    entire file to the Special Investigations Section of Revenue
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . I infer it was the amount of the unreported income that explains the CRA's
    decision to criminally prosecute Mr. Jarvis, rather than the evidence available
    to establish the elements of the criminal offences. This is a matter of discretion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court decided that the penal investigation did not begin until May
    4, 1994 when the file was so referred. In <i>Jarvis</i>, of all the factors,
    factor (c) was given controlling weight.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, there is no evidence that Liviero delayed transferring the files
    for criminal investigation of penal tax liability in order to further use
    the audit powers to obtain information for criminal prosecution. I would
    attach great weight to the date on which Liviero transferred his file in
    determining when the investigation of penal liability began.</p>
  <h3>Factor (d) -- Was the conduct of the auditor such that he or she was effectively
    acting as an agent for the investigators?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case the trial judge found that “the proximity to each other of all
    the employees in SEP and investigations” established that Liviero was acting
    as an agent for the investigators. The Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>Jarvis</i> makes
    evident that the mere proximity of the auditor to the investigator in the
    CRA office space is insufficient reason to find the auditor acted as an agent
    for the investigators. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Jarvis</i>,
    the auditor met with the investigator for one or two hours after referring
    the file, and a few times after that to clarify information.<i> </i>When
    the auditor concealed from Mr. Jarvis that she had referred his file for
    criminal investigation, she acted in part on the advice of the criminal investigator “to
    stall”. The investigator did not want Mr. Jarvis to discover his file had
    been referred. The auditor reported her communications with Mr. Jarvis to
    the investigator. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court found the auditor did not effectively act as the investigator's
    agent. The Supreme Court said that there was no evidence that the investigator
    “ever instructed or requested [the auditor], under the guise of an audit,
    to obtain further information from or about the appellant” (para. 24).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Jarvis</i> demonstrates
    that even if the auditor communicates with the investigator about the content
    of the audit file and goes so far as to consult with the investigator about
    CRA's relationship with the taxpayer, there is still not enough to constitute
    the auditor an agent of the investigator. An auditor will only be deemed
    an agent of the investigator if the auditor uses the inspection and requirement
    powers to obtain information for the investigation of criminal tax offences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    proximity of SEP's office space to that of Criminal Investigations cannot
    establish that Liviero acted as an agent for the criminal investigator, Fish.
    The trial judge alluded to, but did not identify, other circumstances that
    indicated Liviero acted as an agent for the investigators. The record, however,
    does not show anything in Liviero's contact and relationship with the investigators
    that was remotely similar to what existed in the <i>Jarvis</i> case. I would
    find that Liviero did not act as an agent of the investigators. </p>
  <h3>Factor (e) -- Does it appear that the investigators intended to use the
    auditor as their agent in the collection of evidence?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is the correct finding on the evidence.</p>
  <h3>Factor (f) -- <span lang=EN>Is the evidence sought relevant to taxpayer

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my reasons above, I found that the trial judge erred by deciding whether
    Liviero's inquiries were an “audit” or an “investigation”. The trial judge
    made only a single finding relating to the “predominant purpose” of Liviero’s
    inquiries. He said at para. 14(14) of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find, as a fact, that when the first requirements
    were issued by Liviero on March 23, 2000 to the Toronto-Dominion and the
    Royal Bank of Canada, that the purpose of the issuances as his covering letter
    indicates, was “to pursue the determination of the existence, and, as applicable,
    the source, application and reporting of alleged unreported income,” i.e.
    that the predominant purpose of the requirements was the determination of
    penal liability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[178]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no support in the record for this finding. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[179]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Undeniably,
    the inquiries were relevant to the prosecution of the criminal tax offences
    with which the respondents were eventually charged. However, at the time
    the requirements were issued, the inquiries “to pursue the determination
    of the existence, and, as applicable, the source, application and reporting
    of alleged unreported income” were also indispensable to the determination
    of the elements of the civil offence under s. 163(2).<i> </i>Whether Holterman
    had received monies that he failed to report as income was the apt subject
    of a regulatory inquiry. The trial judge did not explain why he saw the <i>predominant
    purpose</i> of the requirements issued at this time to be the determination
    of penal liability rather than civil liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s error is that he did not pay heed to the word “only” in factor
    (f).<i> </i>Factor (f) addresses whether the <span lang=EN>evidence sought
    is relevant “only to the taxpayer’s penal liability”. It is not enough that
    the inquiry seeks evidence that could be seen as relevant to penal liability
    when it is clearly relevant to civil liability as well.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[181]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would gut the broad inspection and requirement powers to reason that an inquiry
    is predominantly penal as soon as an inquiry seeks information that could
    be in a penal prosecution. Such reasoning would prevent any use of the inspection
    and requirement powers without warrant because the elements of the criminal
    tax offences always encompass the elements of the regulatory tax offences.
    One must keep in mind that the <i>ITA</i> is essentially a regulatory statute
    and the broad inspection and requirement powers are valuable regulatory tools.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[182]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was no evidence in the record on which it could be found that Liviero’s use
    of the inspection and requirement powers related “only” to the determination
    of penal liability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[183]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    concluding, I am frankly perplexed by the trial judge's finding there was
    no information before Liviero to commence an audit of Holterman as a taxpayer.
    The finding seems at odds with his finding that Liviero commenced a criminal
    investigation because he believed that Holterman was involved in fraud transactions
    wherein he received monies that he failed to report as income. While not
    standardless, much less is needed to commence a tax audit than a criminal
    investigation.  In any event, whether Liviero had a sufficient basis to conduct
    a tax audit was not before the trial judge. The fact is that Liviero used
    the broad inspection and requirement powers to determine whether Holterman
    failed to report income. The question the trial judge had to decide was whether
    Liviero did so for the predominant purpose of investigating penal liability
    as opposed to regulatory tax liability. </p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>Conclusion</span></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[184]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would conclude that none of the <i>Jarvis</i> factors support the inference
    that the predominant purpose of Liviero's inquiries was the investigation
    of Holterman’s penal liability. Rather, those inquiries were of a regulatory
    nature directed to “the determination of the existence, and, as applicable,
    the source, application and reporting of alleged unreported income.” The
    goal was to collect tax from suspected criminals. When Liviero concluded
    that criminal charges under the <i>ITA</i> were appropriate, he referred
    the file to the Criminal Investigations branch of the CRA. At that point,
    the predominant purpose of the further inquiries made by the CRA was directed
    to penal prosecution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[185]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would set aside the trial judge's finding that the information Liviero obtained
    using the inspection and requirement powers of the <i>ITA</i> constituted
    a breach of Holterman's rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>. That information
    should not have been excluded.</p>
  <h3>Section 24(2)</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[186]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    I am wrong and Liviero's inquiries did infringe Holterman's rights under
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, I would not defer to the trial judge’s finding
    that the evidence he obtained should be excluded under s. 24(2).<i> </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[187]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence is not conscriptive and there is no issue of trial fairness. The
    respondents had little or no expectation of privacy in the documents given
    the broad inspection and requirements the CRA possessed under the <i>ITA</i>.
    The reliability of the evidence is undoubted, and it was indispensable to
    the prosecution.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[188]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    serious misconduct of Liviero consisted principally of deliberately lying
    to the court. What the trial judge described as a deliberate lie by Liviero,
    I would characterize as a difference of opinion on a question of mixed fact
    and law. Liviero had testified he had conducted an audit, whereas the court
    found he had conducted an investigation. It was the court’s different determination
    on that complex question that provided the basis for concluding Liviero’s
    testimony was false. I consider that the trial judge erred in principle by
    viewing Liviero’s testimony as serious misconduct. I would find that the
    information obtained by Liviero should not be excluded under s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[189]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that Fish also misled the issuing justice by testifying
    that Liviero conducted an audit and not an investigation. Again, I would
    not view this as serious misconduct. However, the trial judge also indicated
    that Fish had failed to make full and frank disclosure in the Information
    to Obtain that he swore. The Crown concedes this. I would defer to the trial
    judge's decision to exclude the information obtained by Fish.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s analysis and conclusion was driven by the fact
    that Liviero suspected Holterman was engaged in criminal activity from the
    very outset. There is nothing that sets this case apart from any RCMP referral
    to the CRA under the Working Arrangements.  Upholding the trial judge’s decision
    would enfeeble the Working Arrangements between the RCMP and the CRA. Upon
    receiving the information of the taxpayer’s suspected criminal activity from
    the RCMP, CRA officials would not be permitted to use the broad inspection
    and requirement powers to make inquiries into such taxpayers’ unreported
    income.  Taxpayers who the RCMP had investigated for criminal activity would
    in a better position than taxpayers not suspected of any criminal activity.
    The trial judge failed to appreciate that the CRA may pursue regulatory enforcement
    of the <i>ITA</i> against suspected criminals just as it can against ordinary
    taxpayers. There is no reason why the CRA cannot tailor the way it proceeds
    with regulatory enforcement depending on the taxpayer involved and the nature
    and source of suspected unreported income. Only when it is apparent that
    the predominant purpose of the CRA’s inquiries is criminal investigation
    that the <i>Charter</i> is engaged. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judge’s findings related to Liviero’s
    inquiries, dismiss the application to exclude the information Liviero obtained
    from being introduced at trial, and remit the matter to the Superior Court
    for a new trial before a different judge.  At the new trial the information
    obtained by Liviero will be admissible, but the information obtained by Fish
    using the requirement powers and pursuant to the search warrants will be
    excluded.</p>
