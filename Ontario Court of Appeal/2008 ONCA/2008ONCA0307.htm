    appellants appeal from the judgment of Browne J. dismissing their application
    for a declaration that they had obtained an easement or covenant which entitled

    water to which the appellants lay claim comes from a well located on the
    respondents’ property. The well is serviced by an electric submersible pump
    and a pressure tank at the surface. The surface facilities are housed in
    a small shed on the respondents’ property. The water is supplied to the appellants’ property
    through underground pipes.</p>

    the well water was piped to a number of properties owned by various people
    who had purchased lots from the original owners. The original owners had
    subdivided the property and installed the well and the piping leading to
    the various subdivided lots.  By the time the appellants commenced their
    lawsuit against the respondents, the other lot owners had drilled their own
    wells and no longer required a supply of water from the respondents’ property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants took title to their lot not from the original owners, but from
    a third party. The respondents also purchased their lot (the well property)
    from a third party. The original owners have long since ceased to have any
    interest in the well property or the other properties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the years, the deeds conveying the well lot and the other lots have included
    the following habendum clause:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>SUBJECT to building
    and other restrictions and conditions set out in Schedule “A” attached hereto.
    It is agreed that these restrictions and covenants shall run with the land
    hereby conveyed and shall bind and also enure to the benefit of the heirs
    and assigns of the various parties to whom any part of the lands so made
    subject to the above restrictions and covenants shall at any time become
    or belong to. All covenants and agreements herein and rights hereby granted

    to in the habendum clause contained six conditions and a preamble which stated
    that the conditions were to form part of any offer to purchase, agreement
    for sale, conveyance or transfer of land for residential or summer cottage
    purposes.  It further provided that “[t]hese restrictions shall run with
    the land.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fifth condition contained in Schedule “A” is pertinent to the case at hand.
    It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The vendor covenants
    to supply water from a central water system for domestic purposes only at
    an annual rate to be paid on or before May lst in each year. This covenant
    will not be applicable if the water system is taken over by either a municipal
    or any provincial agency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is apparent, the “water supply” covenant contemplates that the recipients
    of the water will pay a fee. The evidence at trial established that over
    the years, the well users paid a fee intended to cover the operating costs
    of the well, including maintenance and repairs. At the time the respondents
    purchased the well property in March 2003, five properties were still being
    serviced by the well and the well users were making semi-annual payments
    to cover the operating costs of the well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 28, 2003, the day after the respondents had purchased the well property,
    they wrote to the appellants offering to “continue to provide domestic water
    to [them] using the same rates and billing schedule as was established by
    the [former owner].” The letter continued by noting that
    “[t]he next 6 month billing cycle will occur on September 1st, 2003” and
    that the “costs of ongoing maintenance and repairs of the water line will
    continue to be shared by everyone on the line.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not respond to that letter, but they continued to receive
    water from the respondents’ well and they did not demand a return of the
    monies they had prepaid for the current billing cycle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    months later, in July 2003, the respondents wrote to the appellants and gave
    notice that as of May 3l, 2004, “the supply of water from [their] well will
    be terminated.” In the same letter, the respondents referred to the provisions
    of the agreement of purchase and sale they had entered into when they purchased
    the well property, which stipulated that they
    “would supply water to [the remaining five property owners] on terms no longer
    than 6 months.” They also noted that since they had purchased the property
    in March 2003, the other three users had drilled or would be drilling their
    own wells, leaving the appellants as the only household apart from their
    own receiving water from their well.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent
    correspondence between the appellants and the respondents was exchanged,
    but no resolution could be achieved. The appellants commenced their lawsuit
    in February 2005.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his reasons, the trial judge considered and rejected the submission that
      the appellants had obtained an easement which entitled them to a supply
      of domestic water from the well property.  At para. 35, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>This is not an easement case. Water rights and the subject of easements
      can be applicable in a negative way where the movement or supply of water
      requires no positive step but a refraining from taking negative action
      which might otherwise impede water movement or supply. This is not a case,
      which might be applicable with a dug well, where a party asserts a right
      of entry upon property for the purpose of drawing from an openly exposed
      dug well. In such a fact situation an easement to permit access might be
      found to exist.</span></p>

      trial judge then considered the covenant relating to water supply in Schedule
    “A” with a view to determining its nature and whether it did or did not “run
    with the land either at law or in equity.” He concluded that the covenant
    in issue constituted a positive covenant, and as such, it did not run with
    the land. His reasons in this regard are found at paras. 36-38 as follows:</span></p>

    that require spending money or the doing of some act concluding that such
    covenants do not run with the land either at law or in equity. Simply put
    the supplying of water from a drilled well serviced by motor and pressure
    system into a trunk piping supply conduit system and maintenance thereof
    requires the doing of many acts and the expenditure of money. These are positive
    acts. There is the further issue of liability for unsafe water. The insurance
    costs which may be attracted, have been touched upon in the evidence but
    without particulars. In addition, the cost of necessary steps to supply water
    safe in the context of acceptable, community safety standards are referenced
    in the evidence but without particulars.</span></p>

      rejecting the appellants’ claim to an easement and assessing the nature
      of the water supply covenant as a positive covenant, the trial judge found
      as a fact that the “supplying of water from a drilled well serviced by
      motor and pressure system into a trunk piping supply conduit system and
      maintenance thereof requires the doing of many acts and the expenditure
      of money.” To succeed on this issue, the appellants must satisfy us that

      61(1) of the <i>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,

      the land or a specified part of it is not to be built on or is to be or
      not to be used in a particular manner, or any other condition or covenant
      running with or capable of being legally annexed to land, any such condition
      or covenant may be modified or discharged by order of the Superior Court
      of Justice.</span></p>

      the instance of the respondents, the trial judge considered s. 61(1) of
      the Act and held in the alternative that had the appellants established
      that an easement or covenant existed which entitled them to the supply
      of water, he would have exercised his discretion and applied s. 61(1) to
      discharge it. The trial judge gave cogent reasons for this conclusion at
      para. 44 of his reasons.</span></p>

      our conclusions on the other issues raised by the appellants, we need not
      finally decide whether a court can terminate an easement under s. 61(1)
      of the Act. Suffice it to say that if such a discretionary power exists,
      we are satisfied that the trial judge exercised his discretion appropriately
      in this case. </span></p>

      our conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed, we reject the appellants’
    submission that this is an appropriate case in which to grant leave to review
    the costs award made by the trial judge. The fact that a trial was ordered
    despite the appellants’ attempt to proceed expeditiously by way of application
    carries little weight. Clearly, this was a case that required the trial of
    an issue and to the extent that the appellants may have thought otherwise,
    they were mistaken. Nor, in our view, is there anything untoward or unreasonable
    in the costs award made by the trial judge.  Accordingly, we deny leave to
    appeal costs.</span></p>
