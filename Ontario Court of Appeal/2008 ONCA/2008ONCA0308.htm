    appeal arises from a commercial land transaction between the appellant and
    purchaser, York Bremner Developments Limited (“York Bremner”), and the respondent
    and vendor, FHR Properties Inc. (“FHR”).  In July 2006, FHR transferred the
    property to York Bremner, who granted FHR a Charge by means of a two year
    Vendor Take Back Mortgage.  The appeal involves the interpretation of paragraphs
    2 and 3 of the Vendor Take Back Mortgage agreement. Paragraph 2 reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Provided that
    this Charge will mature and be repaid in full at the expiry of the Term from
    the Closing Date.  Interest on the principal amount owing is payable and
    due under the Charge, semi-annually at the rate of 2% per annum.  <i>On the
    date the Charge is due and payable, the principal amount thereunder shall
    be reduced by the amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($1,500,000)
    (the “Reduction Amount”).  There will be no interest computed and payable
    on the Reduction Amount portion of the principal under this Charge.  Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, the amount owing under the Charge will become due and payable
    five (5) days after the Chargor obtains a shoring and excavation permit for
    the lands. </i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “shoring
    and excavation permit” refers to a document issued by the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Such a permit is required to conduct work to remedy a problem with
    pipes and equipment installed by the City that block access to a service
    tunnel on the property.  The application judge noted that the idea behind
    para. 2 was that once York Bremner had obtained this permit, it was prepared
    to begin construction, anticipated that alternative financing would become
    available and render the Vendor Take Back Mortgage unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    3 of the VTBM states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Charge shall
    be open to prepayment.  Such prepayment may only be made in full and on the
    fifteenth day of January and the fifteenth day of July of each year of the
    Term.  <i>In the event the Purchaser makes a prepayment in accordance with
    this Section 3, the principal amount will be reduced by an amount equal to
    interest calculated on such principal amount for the period of the Term otherwise
    remaining</i>, which interest will be calculated at the prime rate posted
    by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on the date of such prepayment less
    2% calculated on the same basis as the interest payable on the Charge.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>York
    Bremner applied for the shoring and excavation permit in September 2006.
    Then, in early December 2006, York Bremner advised FHR that it intended to
    exercise the repayment option under para. 3 at the first possible date, namely,
    January 15, 2007.  On that date, York Bremner tendered payment for the amount
    that was outstanding under the Charge after taking into account the deductions
    contemplated by both paras. 2 and 3.  Unknown to both parties at the time,
    the City had already issued the permit on January 10, thereby making the
    Charge due and payable pursuant to para. 2 on the same day as York Bremner
    intended to exercise the prepayment option under para. 3.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge accepted the respondent’s submission that the appellant
    was not entitled to exercise the prepayment option under para. 3 of the Charge
    and ruled accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the result reached by the application judge.  In our view, the
    effect of the issuance of the permit on January 10 was to trigger, pursuant
    to para. 2, maturity of the mortgage and the obligation to pay the “amount
    owing under the Charge”
    five days later, on January 15. As the mortgage had matured and become due
    and payable on January 15, it could not be prepaid on that date and, therefore,
    para. 3 simply had no application.  Accordingly, we do not accept the submission
    that the application judge erred by failing to harmonize paras. 2 and 3.  On
    the facts, there was no disharmony between those two provisions. Given the
    issuance of the permit and the consequent operation of para. 2, para. 3 simply
    did not apply.  As the application judge concluded, at para. 38 of her reasons,
    the type of payment contemplated by para. 3 “by its nature must be made before
    a maturity payment is due and payable.  That did not occur in this case.” </p>
