    April 23, 2001, the Ontario Sex Offender Registry came into effect.  It requires
    anyone convicted of a designated sex offence to register with the police
    as a designated sex offender for a period of ten years or for life, depending
    on the nature and number of convictions involved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law establishing the Sex Offender Registry was enacted in response to the
    public outcry following the abduction, brutal sexual assault, and murder
    of eleven year old Christopher Stephenson by a multiple sex offender who
    was on parole at the time of the attack.  A coroner’s inquest into Christopher’s
    death was held and the jury recommended that convicted sex offenders be required
    to register with the police. The Ontario Legislature responded and the legislation
    that was enacted is known as “<i>Christopher’s Law</i>”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    Dyck was convicted of sexual interference in September 2000 and in February
    2002 was charged with failing to report under s. 11 of <i>Christopher’s Law</i>.  Although
    he admitted to facts that would justify a conviction under <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i>, he challenged its constitutional validity before Justice Hearn in
    the Ontario Court of Justice both on <i>Charter</i> and federalism grounds.  He
    asserted that <i>Christopher’s Law </i>violated his rights under ss. 7, 11(g),
    11(h), 11(i), 12, and 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  He also asserted that
    the Province does not have the constitutional authority to enact this legislation
    because it is in pith and substance criminal law and therefore falls within
    the competence of the federal government by virtue of s. 91 of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1867</i>.  Mr. Dyck succeeded at trial on the ground that <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> violated his s. 7 liberty rights because it was overly broad.  The
    trial judge declared <i>Christopher’s Law </i>to be of no force and effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the summary conviction appeal judge –
    Justice Hambly of the Superior Court of Justice – the Crown successfully
    overturned the trial judge’s finding of unconstitutionality, however.  Mr
    Dyck cross-appealed.  On the cross-appeal, he renewed his <i>Charter </i>arguments
    (with the exception of his s. 15 argument) but revised his federalism argument.  As
    the federal government had recently enacted the <i>Sex Offender Information
    Registration Act </i>(“<i>SOIRA</i>”),<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Mr. Dyck argued that not only is <i>Christopher’s
    Law </i>criminal law but that the federal government’s new registry had already
    “occupied the field” and was thus paramount.  He was unsuccessful on all
    grounds, however, and the constitutional validity of the Sex Offender Registry
    was upheld.  </p>

    September 12, 2000, the appellant was convicted of sexual interference under
    s. 151 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and sentenced to eleven months in prison

    April 23, 2001, <i>Christopher’s Law</i> came into force.  Mr. Dyck had been
    released from custody the previous day.  He was nonetheless required to register
    under the terms of the Act because he was still serving the probationary
    portion of his sentence, and he did so on May 10, 2001.  The genesis of this
    appeal arises from the fact that continuing to comply with the reporting
    provisions of the Act in a timely fashion proved to be troublesome for Mr.
    Dyck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Dyck’s breaches were not egregious.  One of the reporting requirements of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> – I will outline the provisions of the Act in more detail below – is
    that the offender must notify the police within fifteen days of any change
    in address.  The appellant reported late on three occasions – six days late
    in October 2001; twenty-three days late in January 2002; and again six days
    late in February 2002.  He was warned on the first two occasions that he
    had to comply and that he could be charged if he did not.  On February 22,
    2002 – after the third infraction – he was charged with failure to comply
    with <i>Christopher’s Law</i>.</p>

    Crown called three witnesses: Detective Staff Sergeant Charles Young, Dr.
    Peter I. Collins, and Detective Sergeant Bradley Moore.  Detective Staff
    Sergeant Young explained how the Registry operates.  At the time, he was
    the manager of the Ontario Sex Offender Registry.  Detective Sergeant Moore
    testified about the spatial and geographic behaviour of offenders and how
    this dovetails with the operation of the Registry.  At the time, he was the
    manager of the Geographic Profiling Unit of the Ontario Provincial Police.  Dr.
    Peter Collins testified as an expert in the area of sexually deviant behaviour
    and gave evidence about the typical behaviour of sex offenders, including
    their offence patterns, prognosis for rehabilitation, and risk of recidivism.  He
    was a forensic psychiatrist with the Law and Mental Health Programme, Centre

    only witness called by the defence was Barbara Hill.  She testified that,
    in the view of the John Howard Society, <i>Christopher’s Law</i> did not
    meet the standards of effectiveness and justice, did not reflect good social
    policy, and represented a response to a distorted picture of sex offenders
    and offences.  The information contained in the Sex Offender Registry is
    largely a duplication of information already available elsewhere and the
    focus of public policy should be on the treatment of sex offenders rather
    than on the creation of such a registry, in the Society’s view.  It was Ms.
    Hill’s opinion, based on her review of the literature and statistics, that
    the number of sex offences has declined since 1993.  Further, she testified
    that contrary to the view that sex offenders are predatory strangers, it
    is only a minority of sex offences (approximately 23%) that involve strangers.  She
    disputed the
    “common belief” that all sex offenders re-offend sexually.  Her testimony,
    as the trial judge noted, was in some respects “at odds” with that of Dr.
    Collins.</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown called Detective Staff Sergeant Charles Young of the Ontario Provincial
    Police to explain how the Registry worked in practical terms.  He was the
    manager of the Ontario Sex Offender Registry and responsible for its day-to-day
    operation.  He explained that where an offender meets the compliance criteria,
    he or she is required to report to the local police at specified intervals,
    as outlined above.  Offenders who are subject to the Act are personally served
    with a Notification of Duty to Register – as Mr. Dyck was in this case – and
    must then provide the police with an up-to-date photograph and certain personal
    information (also as outlined above).  According to Detective Staff Sergeant
    Young, the registration process takes approximately fifteen to twenty minutes.  The
    data gathered by the police is then entered into the computerized, province-wide
    Sex Offender Registry and can be accessed by police throughout
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    offender who fails to comply with the obligations imposed by <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> may be subject to a penalty.  Detective Staff Sergeant Young testified
    that the emphasis is on compliance, however, not punishment.  “It is not
    about enforcement,” he said, “it is about compliance.”  He noted that there
    is a high rate of compliance in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (in excess of 93%), and attributed this to the fact that, unlike
    in various American jurisdictions, the contents of the Registry are not public.</p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Staff Sergeant Young testified that the purpose of establishing the Registry
    was to enhance community safety and crime prevention.  The Registry was created
    to provide the police with the necessary information and tools to investigate
    crimes of a sexual nature and to monitor sex offenders – all as part of what
    he described as a multi-disciplined approach to “managing high-risk offenders”.  Both
    Detective Staff Sergeant Young and Dr. Collins emphasized the importance
    of a quick police response in child abduction cases, and the advantages of
    the Registry – which provides the police with particulars of known sex offenders
    within a certain radius – in that regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Dr. Collins to be well qualified to give opinion evidence
    as to the role of registering sex offenders in the promotion of safety and
    prevention of crime.  He cited several key portions of Dr. Collins’ evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    substance, Dr. Collins testified that the Registry is a valuable investigative
    tool because knowing the area in which sex offenders live enhances the odds
    that repeat offenders will be located and victims will be found alive.  He
    testified that sex offenders are prolific in their offending and are at risk
    of re-offending when in the community.  He also testified that actual recidivism
    rates among sex offenders are higher than reported, and that sex offenders
    often live in close proximity to the children they will eventually assault.  The
    Registry enables police to react quickly to a child abduction and conduct
    a radius search with their efforts focused on known sex offenders residing
    in that search area.  And timing is essential where children are abducted
    by non-parental offenders, since 44% of such victims are killed within an
    hour of abduction, 74% within three hours, and 91% within 24 hours.  </p>

    the Crown called Detective Sergeant Bradley J. Moore.  He gave evidence about
    the spatial behaviour of offenders and the use that can be made of the Registry
    in relation to geographic profiling.  He testified that a large percentage
    of offenders are “hunters” who commit crimes in areas close to their “anchor
    point” (which can include their home, work, or social locations).  In his
    view, geographic profiling is valuable because it allows police officers
    to focus their investigative efforts on geographic areas that are likely
    to result in the identification of the offender.   </p>

  at para. 28 of his reasons:</a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>After hearing
    the evidence of Detective Sergeant Moore I am satisfied that the Ontario
    Sex Offender Registry can provide police with information concerning the
    location of registered sex offenders located within a particular jurisdiction
    or radius from a specific location and that this information can assist in
    the preparation of a geographical profile.  I am also satisfied that geographic
    profiling is a valuable investigative technique and the Ontario Sex Offender
    Registry provides information concerning addresses of previously convicted

  fact:</a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

lang=EN>1.&nbsp;        That sexual offences are particularly prevalent in our
      society and victimize mostly women and children and can have substantial

      occasion lead to murder.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

lang=EN>2.&nbsp;        <i>That sex offenders as a group are prolific in their
        offending and sex offenders are likely to reoffend and that a prior conviction
        for such offences is a reliable indication of risk and a proper method
        of assessing that risk.</i> </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>3.&nbsp;        That sexual offenders, particularly serial stranger sex
      offenders, commit crimes within close proximity to their own home.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>4.&nbsp;        That in the case of child sexual offences where an abduction
      occurs time is of the essence in the conducting of police investigations. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>5.&nbsp;        <i>That the creation of a sex offender registry</i> which
      requires those convicted of a designated sexual offence to register with
      the police and provide particulars of address and other information as
      well as provide a photograph and to keep that information current <i>is
      a valuable investigative tool to aid the police when a sexual offence occurs,
      including the ability of the police to conduct a radius search and investigate

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>6.&nbsp;        <i>That the requirements for registration can itself
        be a deterrent to offenders repeating sexual offences</i> which is particularly
        of importance given the fact that at some point after release many of
        such offenders may not be under the supervision of either parole or probation
        officers.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

      useful tool to the police for investigative purposes allowing such investigations
      to be conducted quickly, efficiently and allow reliance on current information
      and as a result the effect of the legislation is, among other things, to
      promote public and community safety. Such objective, i.e. the promotion
      of public and community safety, is very clear from the evidence of the

    from the federal one.  The federal registry system is distinct in at least
    one important respect, however.  It does not provide for automatic inclusion
    on the federal registry upon conviction for a sex offence.  Rather, the court
    may make an order requiring a person to comply with <i>SOIRA</i> upon application
    of the prosecution and, significantly, the offender is entitled to resist
    his or her inclusion on the registry on grounds of gross disproportionality.  Section

    first step of this analysis involves determining the “pith and substance” of

    and effect of legislation, courts will consider the provisions of the statute
    itself –
    including any statements of purpose in the preamble or elsewhere – and may
    have regard as well to the reports of legislative debates surrounding the
    enactment of the legislation.  Here, that exercise supports the conclusion
    that the essential character of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is to protect the
    public through the suppression and prevention of crime, not to stiffen the
    criminal law in a “colourable”
    fashion.</p>

      trial judge found that the legislative purpose of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is
      clearly expressed in its preamble.  He concluded at para. 44 that the pith
      and substance of the law “is directed to community safety and protection
      of the public.”  His determination of both the purpose and effect of the
      legislation is reflected in the following passages at paras. 41-44 of his
  reasons:</a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[41]     <i>Christopher’s Law</i> requires persons convicted of enumerated
    sexual offences to register and maintain as current particulars of their
    address and other basic information.  This effectively permits what the Crown
    has referred to as “tracking” of the residence of such offenders.  This requirement
    permits a timely disclosure to the police of the addresses of registered
    sex offenders which, in the investigation of sexual offences based on the
    evidence presented, can serve as a valuable investigative tool, particularly
    so when a child is the victim.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[42]     Further, the evidence supports the proposition that the registration
    in itself can act as a deterrent to the sexual offender by the very act of
    registration.  The legislation appears to be tailored to very laudable goals
    regarding the protection of the community, the promotion of public safety
    and as a valuable investigative tool readily available to the police to assist
    in the investigation of sexual offences.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[43]     Given the evidence concerning the nature and commission of such
    offences, and the proclivity of sexual offenders to reoffend, such legislation
    properly drafted is, I find, valuable in protecting the community from such
    offences by not only assisting in their investigation but also by suppressing
    conditions which could lead to such offences by police presence and offender
    awareness.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    is directed to community safety and protection of the public.</p>

    evidence of the purpose of the Act – although perhaps not strictly necessary
    in the circumstances of this case, given the clear statement of purpose in
    the preamble – is found in the Reports of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario
    during the debates leading up to its enactment.  These confirm that the emphasis
    of the legislation is on community safety and protection through the establishment
    of a registry system for sex offenders.  </p>

    surprisingly, in view of the impetus provided for the legislation by the
    murder and sexual assault of Christopher Stephenson, many of these statements
    were couched in terms of the need “to protect our children”.  However, the
    preamble to the Act itself, as well as statements made in the Legislature,
    make it clear that the intended reach of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> went beyond
    protecting the safety of children alone (although it clearly encompassed
    that goal) to the protection of the citizens of Ontario as a whole.  For
    example, Mr. Frank Mazzilli, who spoke about the legislation on behalf of
    the Solicitor-General in the course of second reading on December 22, 1999,
    stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    to protect our children, wherever they may be, from sexual predators.  Our

    that is not always understood.  The court is concerned solely with the constitutionality

    to pass judgment whether the Act is a wise Act or an unwise Act, or, indeed,
    whether it conforms to the private preference of any member of the court.  The
    wisdom of the legislation and its underlying policy considerations are for
    the legislative body which has the jurisdiction assigned to it by the distribution
    of powers in the Constitution to determine.  The constitutionality of such

    at the protection of the community, the promotion of public safety, and the
    creation of a valuable investigative tool to assist police in the investigation

    Supreme Court of Canada also commented on the general characteristics of “criminal
    law” in the <i>Firearms Act Reference</i>.  As a general rule, it said at
    para. 27 “legislation may be classified as criminal law if it possesses three
    prerequisites: a valid criminal law purpose backed by a prohibition and a
    penalty.”  See also <i>Reference Re Dairy Industry Act (

      Law</i> is not a colourable attempt to enact criminal law.  It may impose
      a penalty for non-compliance with its registration requirements, but it
      does not have a criminal law purpose nor does it prohibit anyone from doing
      anything.  As I indicate later in these reasons – in the portion dealing
      with the arguments under ss. 11(h) and 11(i) of the <i>Charter</i> – neither
      the requirement to register and report under the Act nor any stigma attaching
      to the registration constitute punishment.  As the trial judge found, the
      Act’s primary purpose is to protect the community and enhance public safety.  <i>Christopher’s
      Law </i>is not aimed at stiffening the criminal law or creating a new criminal
      offence or imposing punitive consequences: see <i>Schneider </i>at 467.  Its
      dominant characteristic is not a prohibition coupled with a penalty for
      a criminal law purpose.  Rather, <i>Christopher’s Law</i> establishes what
      is predominantly a regulatory scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, to the extent that <i>Christopher’s Law </i>may overlap with a
    federal head of power, this is constitutionally permissible.  The jurisprudence
    supports the existence of a concurrent authority between the federal government
    and the provinces with respect to the suppression of conditions giving rise
    to crime and the prevention of crime: see <i>Schneider</i>; <i>Di Iorio v.
    Montreal (City) Common Jail</i> (1978), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 289 (S.C.C.); and <i>O’Hara
    v. British Columbia</i> (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (S.C.C.).  This is sometimes
    known as the “double aspect” doctrine.  Dickson J. put it this way in <i>Di
    Iorio</i> at p. 327:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Implicit in
    the grant to the Provinces of exclusive authority in respect of administration
    of justice and in the grant to the federal Government of exclusive legislative
    authority in respect of criminal law and procedure is an <i>acceptance of
    a certain degree of overlapping</i>.  One should not expect to be able to
    draw a fine line between the two heads of power nor should one attempt to
    do so.  Time and again the Courts have given effect to what was said by Duff,
    C.J., in <i>Re Combines Investigation Act</i> … [1929] S.C.R. 409 at p. 413:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Matters,
    however, which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the jurisdiction
    of a Province over the subjects designated by one or more of the heads of
    s. 92 may in another aspect and for another purpose, be proper subjects of
    legislation under s. 91, and in particular under head 27.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Thus, a matter
      which for some purpose may fall within the scope of the federal power over
      criminal law and criminal procedure may also fall within the legitimate
      concern of the Provinces as pertaining to the administration of justice. </i>[Emphasis

    in <i>Schneider</i> at p. 468 Dickson J., albeit in dissent, returned to
    the same theme:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The interface between criminal law and provincial legislation
    which might be seen as impugning upon the federal jurisdiction in the field
    of criminal law has not been closely drawn.  As Professor Hogg notes in Constitutional
    Law of Canada (1977), chapter 16 of his work, the dominant tendency of the
    case-law has been to uphold provincial penal legislation; recent cases have
    been generous to provincial power, and “<i>the result is that over much of
    the field which may loosely be thought of as criminal law legislative power
    is concurrent</i>” (at p. 292).<a href="#_ftn4"

    para. 26, the Supreme Court observed: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The determination
    of which head of power a particular law falls under is not an exact science.  In
    a federal system, each level of government can expect to have its jurisdiction
    affected by the other to a certain degree.  As Dickson C.J. stated in <i>General
    Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National Leasing,</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R. 641,
    at p. 649, “overlap of legislation is to be expected and accommodated in
    a federal state”.  Laws mainly in relation to the jurisdiction of one level
    of government may overflow into, or have “incidental effects”
    upon, the jurisdiction of the other level of government.  It is a matter
    of balance and of federalism: no level of government is isolated from the

      and LeBel recently sketched out the parameters of the doctrine of federal
      paramountcy – one of the constitutional doctrines used to balance the federal
      dynamic in this country – as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>According to

    went on at para. 71 to reinforce as “the fundamental test for determining
    whether there is sufficient incompatibility to trigger the application of
    the doctrine” the impossibility of dual compliance standard enunciated by
    Dickson J. in <i>Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R.
    161 at p. 191:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In principle,
    there would seem to be no good reasons to speak of paramountcy and preclusion
    except where there is actual conflict in operation as where one enactment
    says “yes” and the other says
    “no”; “the same citizens are being told to do inconsistent things”; compliance
    with one is defiance of the other.</p>

    necessarily mean incompatibility:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Thus, according
    to this test, the mere existence of a duplication of norms at the federal
    and provincial levels does not in itself constitute a degree of incompatibility
    capable of triggering the application of the doctrine.  Moreover, a provincial
    law may in principle add requirements that supplement the requirements of
    federal legislation (<i>114957
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    is the case with <i>Christopher’s Law</i> and <i>SOIRA</i>.  There is nothing
    preventing offenders from complying with both pieces of legislation.  Indeed,
    each regulatory scheme recognizes and contemplates compliance with the other.  <i>SOIRA</i> anticipates
    the continued operation of the provincial Registry, at least to the extent
    that it authorizes the Attorney General of Ontario to serve notices on provincial
    registrants triggering their obligation to register under the federal legislation.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    the fact that <i>SOIRA</i> contains a mechanism whereby an offender may obtain
    an exemption from the obligation to register or a termination of that obligation
    after a period of time, whereas <i>Christopher’s Law</i> calls for automatic
    offence-based registration, does not trigger the doctrine of paramountcy,

    appellant argues that <i>Christopher’s Law</i> violates his rights under
    ss. 11(g), 11(h), 11(i), and 12 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Those sections provide
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been
    varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the
    benefit of the lesser punishment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the requirement to register and to report under <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> “brands” a person a sex offender and constitutes punishment.  He
    argues that the registration requirement generates stigma, and that the stigma
    arises not from the conviction but from the subsequent labelling.  He analogizes
    the situation to the old puritanical concept of branding an adulterer with
    a giant “A” on his or her forehead and the overwhelming social stigma that
    such a mark carried with it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    punishment and stigmatization violates his <i>Charter </i>rights, the appellant
    submits.  The mandatory registration and reporting requirements are not only
    punishment, on this argument; they constitute cruel and unusual punishment
    in violation of s. 12 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In addition – since <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> was not in force when the appellant committed the underlying sexual
    offence – its operation is retrospective and a violation his ss. 11(g), 11(h),
    and 11(i) rights.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    s. 11(g) has no application here.  The fact that <i>Christopher’s Law</i> was
    not in effect at the time Mr. Dyck was convicted of the underlying offence
    is of no moment.  The underlying crime – sexual interference –
    was an offence under Canadian law when the appellant committed it.  Further,
    when the appellant was charged with a breach of <i>Christopher’s Law</i>,
    that infraction was an offence under Canadian law at the time.  Thus, Mr.
    Dyck has not been found guilty of an act or omission that was not an offence
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    at the time the act or omission was committed.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    ss. 11(h) and 11(i) of the <i>Charter </i>also have no application to these
    facts because neither the requirement to register and report nor the stigma,
    if any, arising from the registration are punishment within the meaning of
    ss. 11(h) and 11(i) of the <i>Charter</i>.  To characterize registration
    under the Act as punitive, the appellant would have to show that its purpose,
    being criminal in nature, is &quot;to mete out criminal punishment&quot; or
    that it has a
    &quot;true penal consequence&quot;: see <i>R. v. Shubley</i> (1990), 52 C.C.C.
    (3d) 481 at 494 (S.C.C.); and <i>R. v. Wigglesworth, </i>[1987] 2 S.C.R.
    541 at 559.<i> </i>A true penal consequence, according to the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Wigglesworth </i>at 561<i> </i>is &quot;imprisonment or a
    fine which by its magnitude would appear to be imposed for the purpose of
    redressing the wrong done to society at large&quot;.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Additionally,
    as Charron J. noted in <i>R. v. Rodgers </i>(2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 225<i> </i>at
    para. 63,
    “punishment” as contemplated in ss. 11(h) and 11(i) of the <i>Charter</i> does
    not necessarily encompass “every potential consequence of being convicted
    of a criminal offence, whether that consequence occurs at the time of sentencing
    or not.”  She went on to say:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a general
    rule, it seems to me that the consequence will constitute a punishment when
    it forms part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable
    in respect of a particular offence <i>and the sanction is imposed in furtherance
    of the purpose and principles of sentencing.</i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge found that <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is not in pith and substance
    punitive legislation.  The summary conviction appeal court judge agreed,
    as do I.  The requirement to report and register with police is not a sanction
    imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles of sentencing for the
    index offence.  Nor is it a “true penal consequence”: see <i>Wigglesworth </i>at
    559.  Rather, it is a protective measure designed to safeguard the public
    from recidivist sex offenders and to equip the police with an important investigative
    tool.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    to the extent there is any “stigma”
    associated with registration, in my view any such stigma flows more from
    the conviction for the underlying sex offence than from registration and
    the requirement to report: see <i>Rodgers </i>at para. 64; and <i>R.  v.
    Cross</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at para. 55 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal
    to S.C.C. refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 161.  This is particularly so in the
    context of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> – and in contrast to similar regimes
    in foreign jurisdictions – because the fact of registration remains confidential
    to police officials only and thus is not widely known in the community.  In
    any event, even if there is some stigma attached to registration, it does
    not render the pith and substance of the law punitive.  As Laskin J.A. observed
    in <i>R. v. Budreo</i> (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 542 at para. 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Some aspects
    of s. 810.1 are punitive or coercive: the availability of an arrest warrant;
    detention pending a hearing unless the defendant is released on bail; and
    jail on the defendant’s refusal to enter into a recognizance.  These coercive
    aspects, however, are necessary to preserve the integrity of the s. 810.1
    proceedings.  <i>By themselves, they do not turn s. 810.1 into a punitive
    provision.  Nor does the stigma that undoubtedly accompanies a s. 810.1 proceeding
    make the proceeding punitive.  </i>That stigma will attach whether the section
    is preventive or punitive. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Nova Scotia Court of Appeal applied the same reasoning in <i>Cross</i>, where
    Bateman J.A. concluded that the provisions of <i>SOIRA</i> calling for registration
    and reporting of designated sex offenders did not constitute punishment.  The
    requisites of <i>SOIRA</i> and of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> are similar in
    most respects, except for the potential for a sex offender to obtain an exemption.  I
    see no difference in principle between the two regimes in terms of whether
    the legislation is punitive or not.  <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is, as I say,
    preventive not punitive in pith and substance, and the registration requirement
    does not constitute punishment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion is consistent with the law as it has developed in similar areas.  For
    example, a DNA databank order is not punishment: see<i> Rodgers</i> at para.
    64 and <i>R v. Briggs</i> (2000), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 38 at para. 71 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 31. Neither is
    an order requiring that a person enter into a recognizance pursuant to s.
    810.01 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: see <i>Budreo </i>at paras. 29-31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    ss 11(h) and 11(i) of the <i>Charter</i> are not engaged.  The appellant
    is not being “punished” for the same offence twice and there is no disparity
    in “punishments” in play.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion, by itself, does not preclude the operation of s. 12, however.  Although
    the application of the Registry to persons in the position of the appellant
    is not punishment, it may well constitute “treatment” within the meaning
    of that provision.  Justice Charron was of the view in <i>Rodgers </i>at
    para. 63, for example, that DNA sampling ordered as a result of conviction
    would constitute
    “treatment”.  I am prepared to assume for these purposes, without deciding,
    that the application of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> may amount to “treatment”.  However,
    even if it does, s. 12 is of no assistance to the appellant here<i> </i>because
    the requirements of registration and reporting do not constitute “cruel and
    unusual” treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    registration and reporting requirements of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> are relatively
    minimal in terms of their intrusion and effect on the privacy and liberty
    of the appellant.  To qualify as “cruel and unusual” treatment or punishment,
    a disposition must be “grossly disproportionate” to what is appropriate in
    the circumstances.  I shall return to the issue of the effect and impact
    of the requirements of the Act, and to the notion of “gross disproportionality” in
    the next portion of these reasons.  Suffice it to say that the requirements
    of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> fall far from the high standard called for by
    such a test.  Section 12 of the <i>Charter</i> is therefore not engaged in
    these circumstances either.</p>

    s. 7 attack is two-pronged.  First, he submits that <i>Christopher’s Law</i> runs
    afoul of the principles of fundamental justice because it is overbroad and
    therefore constitutionally flawed.  Secondly, he contends that the Act violates
    the principles of fundamental justice on procedural fairness grounds in at
    least two ways: (i) it is impermissibly retrospective; and (ii) it deprives
    the appellant and others in his position of the right to a hearing or resort
    to some mechanism whereby they may seek an exemption from registration, or
    a review of the requirement for registration, or a termination of the requirement
    at some point short of its statutory expiration date.</p>

    liberty.  Counsel submit, however, that the restriction is limited and that
    s. 7 is not infringed because <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is carefully tailored

    with the principles of fundamental justice.  Here, since the Crown concedes
    that there has been a deprivation of the appellant’s liberty interest – however
    minor it may be – the appeal turns on whether that deprivation is in accordance
    with the principles of fundamental justice.  I do not accept the appellant’s

      with its companion decision, <i>R v. Malmo-Levine; R v. Caine</i> (2003),

      of marihuana.  In addressing the notion of overbreadth in the context of
      s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, Justices Gonthier and Binnie reiterated that
      overbreadth was a function of arbitrariness and explained that the standard
      for assessing a s. 7 infringement on this basis was gross disproportionality.  This
      standard, in turn, they said, captured the measure of deference to which

    enacting <i>Christopher’s Law, </i>in my view, the Legislature acted rationally
    pursuant to the legitimate state interest of community protection.  The trial
    judge found that sex offences are particularly prevalent in our society and
    that they cause physical, psychological, and emotional harm to their victims.  The
    valid state objective of <i>Christopher’s Law </i>is to address this harm

    (i) that sex offenders are prolific offenders who are likely to re-offend;
    and (ii) that a prior <span lang=EN>conviction for a sex offence is a reliable

    a group sex offenders are always going to be at risk” and that “if a person
    has offended sexually they are going to be a greater risk than the rest of
    the population for engaging in that activity”.  There is therefore a presumptive
    risk of harm to potential victims of all ages posed by persons convicted
    of sex offences, even though there may be numerous offenders amongst that
    group who ultimately do not re-offend at all.  These findings underpin the

    the one hand, the state interest sought to be achieved by the legislation – community
    safety and protection for the public –
    is very important.  This is made clear by the trial judge’s findings of fact
    and by his conclusions regarding the purpose and effect of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i>.  I have recited these at length earlier in these reasons, at paras.
    30-31.  I especially underscore the following findings of the trial judge:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>(a)       That sexual offences are particularly prevalent in
    our society and victimize mostly women and children and can have substantial
    physical, psychological and emotional impact on the victims, even occasionally
    leading to murder; </p>
  <p align=left style='

    offending and are likely to re-offend, and that a prior conviction for such
    offences is a reliable indication of risk and a proper method of assessing
    that risk; and </p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(c)       That the creation of a sex offender registry requiring those convicted
    of a designated sexual offence to register with the police and provide particulars
    of address and other information, including a photograph, and to keep that
    information current, creates a valuable investigative tool to aid the police
    when a sexual offence occurs, including the ability of the police to conduct
    a radius search and to investigate by means of geographic profiling.</p>

    the other hand, the registering and reporting requirements imposed by <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> are quite modest in comparison.  The requirements are limited in
    their informational scope, do not prohibit the appellant from going anywhere
    or doing anything, are no more intrusive than other state-imposed registration
    requirements, impose minimal stigma on the offender, and are not publicly
    known.  Further, even if, as the trial judge found, the Registry may incorporate
    a class of persons who may never re-offend, the Act is not overbroad because,
    as I will explain later in these reasons, individualized risk assessment
    is not a <i>Charter </i>requirement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    registering and reporting requirements of the Act are limited in scope and
    not time consuming.  As discussed above, an offender who meets the compliance
    criteria must:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>(a)       report personally to the police on registration and
    on an annual basis thereafter (or each time the offender moves);</p>
  <p align=left style='

    short, designated sex offenders have to tell the police who they are, where
    they are, and how they may be located or contacted.  According to the evidence,
    the entire reporting process takes no more than fifteen to twenty minutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    to the extent that the appellant’s privacy interests are impacted by these
    requirements, the impact is very modest in my view.  The type of information
    called for on registration under <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is routinely required
    of individuals in today’s society for a host of regulatory and private needs
    that are the stuff of everyday life – health care advantages, driving permits
    and other licensing benefits, passport applications, credit card applications,
    telephone or cable or satellite television services, and so forth.</p>

    take the point of counsel for the intervener that information is provided
    in these latter circumstances on a voluntary basis, whereas here the offender
    is forced by the state to provide the information to the state for state
    purposes.  However, I make these observations in response.  I query how “voluntary” the
    furnishing of extensive personal information really is in the cases I have
    mentioned above, and in any event the point is not so much the voluntariness
    of supplying the information as it is the perceived intrusiveness of requiring
    it in today’s society.  Furnishing the information called for is not particularly
    intrusive, in my view.  I agree with counsel for the Crown who state at para.
    33 of their factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>Neither
      the physical nor the information duties [imposed by the requirement for

      little about the personal details and lifestyle choices of the individual …  Moreover,
      the reporting obligations under the <i>Act</i> are similar to those routinely
      undertaken by citizens as an incident of day-to-day life.  For example,
      all births, stillbirths and adoptions must be registered with the state.<a

      tag, or when registering to vote.  Citizens must update this information
      at specified intervals and report changes.  In short, in the ordinary course
      of regulated human activities in modern society, the State already compels
      an extensive amount of “registration” and recordkeeping.  Personal data
      is also routinely furnished to private entities such as banks, telephone
      companies, credit card companies and video rental stores, to cite but a
      few examples.  Against this backdrop, the burden imposed by <i>Christopher’s

    reason for concluding that the registration requirements of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> are not grossly disproportionate to the state interest they are designed
    to protect is that they do not prohibit anyone from doing anything or from
    going anywhere.  <i>Christopher’s Law</i> places no restrictions on the freedom
    to make independent choices or to engage in a full range of lawful activities.  It
    is thus quite unlike the legislation under consideration in such cases as <i>Heywood</i> (a
    vagrancy provision preventing those convicted of certain sexual offences
    from loitering in or near a school ground, playground, public park or bathing
    area), <i>Malmo-Levine </i>and <i>Clay</i> (criminal prohibitions against
    the possession of marijuana), or <i>Budreo</i> (a s. 810.1 order subjecting
    persons “likely to commit” certain enumerated offences to the terms of a

    addition, the informational component of the registration requirement of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> is certainly no more intrusive than the informational component of
    other state-imposed registrations.  The constitutionality of both DNA registration
    (see <i>Briggs</i> and <i>R. v. Murrins</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 412 (N.S.C.A.))
    and fingerprint registration (see <i>R. v. Beare</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d)
    57 (S.C.C.)) has been upheld.  If an offender may have a DNA sample taken
    and be subjected to fingerprinting – and have both his or her DNA profile
    and fingerprints kept on record – I do not see why requiring that offender
    to reveal limited information about what he or she looks like and where he
    or she can be contacted renders <i>Christopher’s Law</i> constitutionally
    infirm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded by the intervener’s submission that
    – unlike the information collected through the Sex Offender Registry –
    fingerprints and DNA have “no inherent informational content” because they
    can only provide a profile that can be compared against other samples.  This
    distinction, Ms. Simpson submits, supports the constitutional validity of
    fingerprint and DNA legislation but undermines that of <i>Christopher’s Law</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree.  I should think that the obligation to furnish data that will <i>positively</i> identify
    a past offender as a future offender (and, in the case of DNA, possibly do
    a great deal more) is potentially much more intrusive than the information
    gathered under <i>Christopher’s Law</i>, which merely enables to police to
    identify the likely whereabouts of a possible suspect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that the use of DNA databanks is presently subject to strict operational
    requirements.  For example, only “junk” DNA that cannot reveal the personal
    characteristics of an individual is to be used in the DNA profile.  The investigating
    police do not have access to the DNA profile or the original DNA sample,
    although the data continues to be maintained in the DNA bank.  Exemptions
    are allowed, and it is an offence to use a DNA profile or sample in an impermissible
    way.  See <i>Briggs </i>at paras. 13-14, 16.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court
    of Canada has sounded a note of caution about the latent invasiveness of
    DNA, which holds the key to reveal the entirety of a person’s genetic makeup
    and predisposition towards certain behaviours and diseases.  As Fish J. noted
    in <i>R. v. R.C.</i> (2005), 201 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at paras. 27-28 (S.C.C.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    Rosenberg<i> </i>J.A. in <i>R. v. Hendry </i>(2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 275.  At
    para. 20 of <i>Hendry, </i>for example, Justice Rosenberg said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Thus, use of
    the DNA data bank information resembles the use of fingerprint information
    that law enforcement agencies collect and have collected for many years under
    the Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I.1, with this important
    difference. So far as I am aware, fingerprint information can only be used
    for comparison purposes. It does not provide any personal information about
    the offender. A DNA profile is different. It is capable of providing the
    most intimate details of the person because it can show the person's genetic
    make-up. The DNA sample can be analyzed to determine, for example, if the
    person carries certain genes that make the person more susceptible to disease.
    It is not beyond the realm of possibility that in the future scientists may
    claim to be able to isolate genes that make a person more prone to violence.
    To guard against abuse, it is the policy of the DNA data bank to only use &quot;non-coding&quot; or
    &quot;junk&quot; DNA, that is, only that part of the DNA that does not predict
    any medical, physical or mental characteristics. This policy or convention
    is not, however, written into the legislation.</p>

    spite of this potential, however, the Court ruled in <i>Hendry </i>at para.
    25 that DNA databank orders are to be made “in the vast majority of cases” where
    they are open to the courts under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  As I have said,

    is confidential, except to police authorities, and therefore not widely known.   But
    in any event, as Charron J. noted in <i>Rodgers</i> at para 64, any stigma

    Court recognized that the application of the DNA databank legislation does
    not turn on whether the offender in question may commit a subsequent offence
    regarding which the DNA sample may prove useful.</p>

      it is demonstrated, as it has been here, that the harm is not de minimis,
      or in the words of Braidwood J.A., the harm is
    “not insignificant or trivial”, <i>the precise weighing and calculation of
    the nature and extent of the harm is Parliament’s job</i>.  Members of Parliament
    are elected to make these sorts of decisions, and have access to a broader
    range of information, more points of view, and a more flexible investigative
    process than courts do.  A
    “serious and substantial” standard of review would involve the courts in
    micromanagement of Parliament’s agenda.  <i>The relevant constitutional control
    is not micromanagement but the general principle that the parliamentary response

    second prong of the s. 7 attack made by the appellant and the intervener
    is founded on notions of procedural fairness as a principle of fundamental
    justice.  They submit that <i>Christopher’s Law</i> is constitutionally flawed
    because it fails to afford the offenders affected by it an opportunity to
    make their case that they should be entitled to an exemption from registration,
    or to appeal or seek review of its automatic application, or to apply for
    an order terminating registration at any time prior to the statutory end-date
    for registration.  In addition, the appellant argues that the application
    of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> to the appellant is particularly unfair because
    the Act was not in effect when he was convicted and sentenced for the predicate
    offences.  In these circumstances, he submits, the consequences of registration
    could not even have been contemplated, much less addressed, by counsel for
    the defence at that time.</p>

    appellant and the intervener point to <i>SOIRA </i>as a piece of legislation
    that is properly tailored because it contains provisions for exemptions,
    appeals, reviews, and applications for termination of registration in particular
    cases.  They argue that the standard for exemption from registration under <i>SOIRA, </i>found
    in s. 490.012(4) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>is whether the impact of registration
    on the offender would be “grossly disproportionate to the public interest
    in protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a
    sexual nature”.  They point to numerous decisions of courts across the country
    concluding that gross disproportionality had been established in those cases.</p>

line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s primary submission is the natural justice argument that a person
    should be entitled to be heard when a judicial decision is made affecting
    that person’s interests.  Indeed, the appellant goes so far as to submit
    that “whenever there is an impairment of a liberty or security interest within
    the meaning of Section 7 the principles of fundamental justice require a
    hearing of some sort.”  The intervener states that where a “law engages the
    s. 7 interests of the individual, he or she must be allowed some forum to
    challenge this imposition by the law”.  These propositions are themselves
    overly broad, however, in my view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairness
    may generally require notice and participation when a person’s interests
    are affected.  However, notice and participation are not constitutional prerequisites
    and are not themselves principles of fundamental justice.  The constitutional
    norm is “procedural fairness”.  What is required for procedural fairness
    always depends on context.  Writing for the majority in <i>Rodgers </i>at
    para. 47, Charron J. dealt with this very question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, it
    is important to note at the outset that the fallacy in Mr. Rodgers’ argument
    is that it presupposes that notice and participation are themselves principles
    of fundamental justice, any departure from which must be justified in order
    to meet the minimal constitutional norm.  As I read his reasons, Fish J.
    adopts the same reasoning.  With respect, it is my view that this is not
    the proper approach.  <i>The constitutional norm, rather, is procedural fairness.  Notice
    and participation may or may not be required to meet this norm – it is well
    settled that what is fair depends entirely on the context</i>… [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the right to a hearing and to participate in the decision-making process – important
    as that principle of natural justice is
    – is not a constitutional requirement.  Whether it is required to shore up
    a legislative scheme depends on the circumstances and context.  In my view
    it is not necessary in the context of the Sex Offender Registry established
    by <i>Christopher’s Law.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    it is accepted – as I have done – that the Legislature was entitled to choose
    to include all offenders convicted of the designated sexual offences in the
    Register, having regard to the general risk of recidivism in that group and
    the potential danger to victims, there is no basis to hold that a hearing
    is constitutionally required.  As Rosenberg J.A. observed in <i>Hendry</i> at
    para. 23, “[t]he legislation has already struck a balance by limiting the
    reach of the DNA data bank orders to persons convicted of serious offences…”  Similarly, <i>Christopher’s
    Law </i>has already struck a balance by limiting the reach of Sex Offender
    Registry orders to those convicted of sex offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, a convicted sex offender has a reduced expectation of a hearing
    in these circumstances.  An offender does not become subject to registration
    unless and until he or she has been convicted of a designated sex offence
    after a full and fair trial.  Although it cannot be said to have been so
    in the appellant’s case, it is now the reality that registration is a consequence
    of such a conviction –
    the potential for which is well  known to the accused from the moment the
    charge is laid.  In <i>Hendry</i> at para 18, this Court noted – albeit in
    the DNA context – that “[h]aving been convicted of a designated offence,
    the offender already has a reduced expectation of privacy.”  I would extend
    this to encompass a reduced expectation that he or she would be entitled
    to the full panoply of “natural justice” remedies when facing the non-penal
    consequences of such a conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there is at least some minimal screening built into the operation of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i>.  The registration requirements do not apply (with two exceptions)
    to young persons within the meaning of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C.
    1985, c. Y-1 [repealed] or the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act, </i>S.C. 2002,
    c. 1.  Further, they apply only to persons
    “convicted” of a designated sex offence.  Accordingly, they do not catch
    those who receive absolute or conditional discharges.  Discharges are available
    for a number of the designated offences, including sexual assault, sexual
    exploitation, and sexual interference.  Although such a disposition may be
    unusual where there has been a finding of guilt for a sexual offence – simply
    because of the seriousness of the crime and the implications of a finding
    of guilt – it is likely to be imposed in exactly the kind of situations where
    an exemption from registration might otherwise be thought to be appropriate.  Indeed,
    in at least one case a conditional discharge was granted expressly for the
    purpose of avoiding the application of <i>Christopher’s Law</i>: see <i>R.
    v. Troutlake</i> (2002), 56 W.C.B. (2d) 100 (Ont. C.J.).<a href="#_ftn13"

line-height:normal'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    pursuant to s. 9, the Act does not apply to offenders who have received a
    pardon for all sex offences.  If a pardon is obtained, according to s. 9(3)
    the “ministry shall delete every reference to and record of the offender
    from the sex offender registry”.   Pardons may be obtained under ss. 4(b)(i)
    and 4.1(2) of the <i>Criminal Records Act, </i>R.S. 1985, c. C-47.  According
    to these provisions, a pardon <i>shall </i>be granted where a person has
    been convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction, three years
    have expired after the completion of any punishment for that offence, and
    the offender has not been convicted of another offence during that period.  In
    the case of indictable offences, a pardon <i>may</i> be granted after five
    years if the offender has not been convicted of another offence during that
    period and has been of good behaviour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Heywood</i> Justice
    Cory concluded at pp. 519-520 that the potential availability of a pardon
    was not sufficient to save the vagrancy prohibition under s. 179(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> from the infirmity of overbreadth.  In the case of <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i>, however, the Legislature has seen fit to make the granting of a
    pardon for the predicate sex offences a specific ground for deletion from
    the Registry.  As is the case with discharges discussed above, those circumstances
    where the Crown proceeds summarily with sex offences
    – and thus facilitates the mandatory granting of a pardon – are more likely
    to be circumstances where an offender could make an argument for an exception
    to or termination of registration.  Thus, while the availability of a pardon
    may be insufficient, alone, to defeat the appellant’s overbreadth argument,
    the specific reference to it in <i>Christopher’s Law</i> as a ground for
    deletion of the offender’s name from the Registry is at least a factor to
    be considered in the overall mix in determining whether the Act is constitutionally
    infirm on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is of some relevance as well, in my view, that in several of the jurisdictions
    around the world where sex offender registrations have been established there
    is no review mechanism or discretion in terms of initial registration.  Some
    jurisdictions do provide for a later review and possible termination after
    a period of time.  In the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>
    , the <i>Sexual Offences Act</i> <i>2003 </i>(
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.K.</st1:country-region>
    ), c. 42 permits no discretion and contains no review mechanism.  In the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States of America</st1:country-region>
    , various states have enacted sex offender registration programs complying

    Act.</i><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    respect to initial registration but some states permit an application to
    terminate registration after the initial ten year reporting requirement where
    the offender is found not to endanger public safety any longer.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I acknowledge that in <i>Heywood</i> the vagrancy provisions in s. 179(1)(b)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> were struck down, at least in part because their
    prohibition against loitering in or near various public areas applied for
    an indefinite period without any possibility of review.  At pp. 518-520 Cory
    J. concluded that this characteristic made the prohibition overly broad and,
    therefore, a violation of s. 7.  He placed considerable emphasis on the analogy
    between a lifetime prohibition against loitering in the places mentioned
    without any right of review, and the indeterminate sentence of a person declared
    to be a dangerous offender.  He noted that the indeterminate sentence of
    a dangerous offender was saved from violating s. 12 of the <i>Charter</i> by
    the existence of the parole process (i.e. the right to a subsequent review):  see <i>R.
    v. Lyons</i> (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 31 (S.C.C.).  <i>Heywood</i>, however,
    is distinguishable from the present case in a number of ways.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, <i>Christopher’s
      Law </i>impinges on an offender’s liberty far less than the vagrancy provisions
      did in <i>Heywood.  </i>In <i>Heywood </i>Cory J. was of the view that
      the s. 179(1)(b) prohibition constituted “a very significant limit on an
      individual’s freedom of movement” (although less, he conceded, than the
      indeterminate sentence imposed upon a dangerous offender). <i>Christopher’s
      Law, </i>as noted previously, does not prohibit anybody from doing anything
      and only imposes very minimal restrictions on an individual’s freedom of
      movement when registration is required.  For the reasons already explained, <i>Christopher’s
      Law</i> impinges relatively little on a sex offender’s liberty in comparison
      to the public protection objective it seeks to achieve.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, <i>Heywood</i> must
    be read in the light of subsequent developments in the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    jurisprudence.  In <i>Malmo-Levine </i>and <i>Clay </i>the Supreme Court
    elaborated on the principles of rationality, arbitrariness, and overbreadth.  In
    these cases, the Supreme Court’s principal focus was on the standard of “gross
    disproportionality” and the recognition of the right of legislators to make
    choices between a range of constitutional options.  Moreover, in <i>Rodgers</i> the
    Supreme Court held that notice and the right to participate by way of a hearing
    are not constitutional norms in and of themselves but depend on context for
    their application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Justice Cory recognized the significance of context in <i>Heywood</i> itself,
    noting that attendance by the public at parks and the other places mentioned
    in s. 179(1)(b) was not generally regulated in Canada and observing that
    a “different conclusion regarding the need for review [of a lifetime s. 179(1)(b)
    prohibition] might have been reached if the prohibition was in respect of
    a regulated activity such as driving or the possession of firearms.”  Here – apart
    from the requirement to attend at the police station – the information required
    in relation to registration on the Registry is information commonly called
    for and provided in relation to many regulated <i>and</i> non-regulated activities
    in modern society.  The context of <i>Christopher’s Law</i> simply does not
    mandate as a constitutional minimum that an offender convicted of a designated
    sex offence be afforded a hearing or a right of review before he or she may
    be required to register on the Registry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    point remains to be addressed.  The appellant argues that his not being entitled
    to a hearing or resort to some mechanism for review before being placed on
    the Registry is doubly unfair in his circumstances because <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> was not in effect at the time of his trial and sentencing.  I do
    not think this changes the procedural fairness analysis, however.  He had
    a trial.  He was convicted after a full and fair hearing.  The consequence
    of registration is not penal.  For the same reasons as I have just articulated,
    a hearing or review procedure is not constitutionally mandated by the <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> context.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, therefore, I conclude that <i>Christopher’s Law </i>is <i>intra
    vires </i>the Province and that it is not a colourable attempt to legislate
    criminal law.  Nor is it rendered ineffective by the doctrines of paramountcy.  For
    the reasons articulated above, I reject the argument that the appellant’s
    rights under ss. 11(g), 11(h), 11(i), and 12 of the <i>Charter </i>have been
    violated.  Finally, while registration in accordance with <i>Christopher’s
    Law</i> may infringe an offender’s liberty interest, the offender – in this
    case Mr. Dyck – is not deprived of that liberty interest in a manner that
    contravenes the principles of fundamental justice.  Accordingly, there is
    no breach of s. 7.  </p>

    may be that<i> Clay</i> and <i>Malmo-Levine</i> take slightly different routes
    to arrive at this destination.  The former simply follows the <i>Heywood</i> disproportionality
    approach in the context of “overbreadth”, whereas the latter – without reference
    to overbreadth – adopts a two-staged approach.  In <i>Malmo-Levine</i> the
    Supreme Court calls for an initial assessment of “arbitrariness or irrationality” in
    the context of whether there is a rational connection between the impugned
    legislation and the reasonable apprehension of harm or the state interest
    sought to be protected.  If this threshold is crossed, the second level of
    enquiry consists of an assessment of disproportionality (sometimes also couched
    in terms of “arbitrariness”), with
    “gross disproportionality” again being the ultimate yardstick.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>                Professor Peter Hogg suggests that
    the Supreme Court may have created a new doctrine in <i>Malmo-Levine</i>,
    namely a doctrine of
    “disproportionality”, different from although perhaps a “sister” to overbreadth.  This
    doctrine calls on the court, when ascertaining whether legislation is in
    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, to determine (1) whether
    a law pursues a
    “legitimate state interest”; and, if it does, (2) whether the law is grossly
    disproportionate to the state interest.  Indeed, <i>Malmo-Levine</i> may
    stand for two propositions, according to Professor Hogg, one of arbitrariness
