    appellant appeals from his convictions for sexual offences involving five
    complainants who were either former students of the appellant or former
    students at the grade school or high school at which he taught. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant advanced two grounds of appeal in oral argument. First, he submitted
    that the trial judge erred by reversing the burden of proof. He made three
    arguments in relation to this issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claimed that, whenever there was evidence confirming a complainant’s
    allegations, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence without
    considering whether it raised a reasonable doubt. In addition, the appellant
    contended that when faced with improbabilities concerning the likelihood that he
    would have engaged in sexual activity in the circumstances described by a
    complainant, the trial judge approached the issue presuming guilt. Finally, the
    appellant argued that in rejecting his evidence based on the totality of the evidence,
    the trial judge erred by approaching the credibility issue as a contest rather
    than considering whether the appellant’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of these arguments, the appellant relied primarily on the following
    passages from the trial judge’s reasons. In the first of these passages, the
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>I must say I have some difficulty
    in accepting, first of all, that this activity on the bus occurred, and
    secondly, how physically it could have occurred. The defendant denied its
    occurrence. In considering whether this incident did occur, I am not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did it. It is his word against the
    word of the complainant, and <u>absent any confirming evidence I am prepared to
    give the benefit of the doubt to [the appellant]</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>According to the
    appellant, this passage demonstrates that the trial judge was only prepared to
    give the benefit of any doubt to the appellant where there was no evidence
    confirming the complainants’ version of events.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a
    second passage, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>While there was no evidence led on
    whether the English room door could be locked from the inside, there is no
    doubt that [the appellant], based on the evidence before this court, was quite
    willing to take extraordinary risks to enjoy sexual activity with his students.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>The appellant submits
    that this passage demonstrates that the trial judge approached his evidence
    presuming guilt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the
    third passage, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>[The appellant] simply denied this sexual act
    occurred in the bedroom or at all. <u>On the totality of the evidence, I
    disbelieve him</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>According to the
    appellant, this passage indicates that the trial judge set up a credibility
    contest between the complainants and the appellant, and that the trial judge
    simply chose the complainants’ evidence without assessing whether the
    appellant’s evidence created a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject these arguments. Although perhaps the trial judge’s language in the
    impugned passages might have been clearer, particularly when read in the
    context of the whole of his reasons, we are not persuaded that the trial judge
    erred by reversing the burden of proof. Concerning the first passage relied on
    by the appellant, read fairly, in our view, the trial judge was not saying that
    he would give the benefit of the doubt to the appellant only where there was no
    confirming evidence. Rather, he was stating his finding in relation to this
    specific incident that there was no confirming evidence and his conclusion that
    he had a reasonable doubt concerning whether the particular incident occurred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the second passage relied on by the appellant, in our opinion, it
    does not demonstrate that the trial judge began his analysis presuming guilt.
    Rather, the trial judge was expressing the conclusion he reached after
    reviewing the whole of the evidence. The trial judge gave lengthy reasons in
    which he set out in detail the relevant principles relating to the burden of
    proof. As with the third passage relied on by the appellant, absent clear
    error, the trial judge is presumed to have applied those principles correctly.
    Considered in this light, we are not persuaded that these isolated extracts
    from lengthy reasons that otherwise correctly describe the burden of proof
    demonstrate that the trial judge failed to consider whether the appellant’s
    evidence raised a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his
    second ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred by
    applying a different standard of scrutiny to Crown witnesses as compared to
    defence witnesses and by failing to give adequate reasons for his conclusions
    on credibility. In support of this ground of appeal, the appellant argued that
    the trial judge ignored various pieces of evidence that undermined the
    credibility of the complainants and failed to give adequate reasons for
    rejecting the appellant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do
    not accept these submissions. In our opinion, the trial judge’s reasons
    demonstrate that he was alive to the alleged inconsistencies and
    improbabilities in the complainants’ evidence relied on by the defence. The
    trial judge considered and resolved many of the defence arguments concerning
    these issues in his reasons. For example, he noted that some of the alleged
    inconsistencies could be attributed to the passage of time since the events and
    the age of the girls when the events occurred. Particularly where there was a
    basis in the record for resolving some of the alleged inconsistencies, the
    trial judge was not required to address every alleged inconsistency and
    improbability raised by the defence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One such
    alleged inconsistency was the evidence that two of the complainants both
    visited the appellant’s office for sexual purposes during part of the same
    school term without seeing each other. However, on the record before him, it
    was open to the trial judge to find that the period during which these
    complainants’ visits may have overlapped was brief and that one of the
    complainants attended at the appellant’s office primarily at lunch while the
    other attended primarily after school. In these circumstances, the trial judge
    did not commit reversible error by failing to refer further to this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the trial judge may arguably have relied improperly on a teacher’s observations
    of the demeanour of one of the complainant’s at the time she disclosed the
    sexual assaults, as well as on that teacher’s opinion that the complainant was
    credible, on our review of his reasons, his reliance on this teacher’s
    testimony was not central to his core determinations. </p>

    we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s reasons for rejecting the
    appellant’s denials of the sexual offences were inadequate. He enumerated some
    concerns about the appellant’s testimony, including his evasiveness when
    confronted about propositioning another teacher. In addition, the trial judge
    took into consideration the appellant’s inappropriate discussion about
    pornography with a grade eight student. Most importantly, in our opinion, this
    was a case in which it was appropriate for the trial judge to rely on the
    totality of the complainants’ evidence as a basis for rejecting the appellant’s
    evidence.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Much of
    the strength of the Crown’s case derived from the similar fact evidence. That
    evidence included details given by the five complainants describing the events
    surrounding their various levels of sexual intimacy with the appellant. Significantly,
    three of the complainants provided details of the interior of the appellant’s
    house, of the appellant’s bedroom, of 4 x 6 photographs of the appellant and
    his wife in their bedroom, and about the presence of her birth control pills. As
    well, some of the complainants provided details that the appellant had given
    them regarding his wife, information that would not normally be exchanged
    between a teacher and a student. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was satisfied that the complainants had no motive to bring the
    allegations forward. Indeed, several of them were reluctant to do so. Although
    the appellant argued collusion at trial, most of the complainants had disclosed
    the sexual activity with the appellant years before the investigation commenced.
    In addition, the appellant did not challenge on appeal the trial judge’s
    finding of no collusion nor did he appeal the trial judge’s ruling that the
    evidence of the various complainants could be used as similar fact evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge referred to other evidence at trial that supported the complainant’s
    allegations, including the evidence of one witness who reported seeing and
    hearing apparently sexual behaviour and conversation between the appellant and
    one of the complainants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his
    factum, the appellant submitted that that the trial judge erred in his use of
    the evidence of prior consistent statements. He did not pursue this ground of
    appeal in oral argument. Although we agree that some of the trial judge’s
    language when addressing this issue might have been improved, given the
    allegations of collusion, the trial judge was entitled to refer to this
    evidence. When considered as a whole, we are not satisfied that the trial
    judge’s reasons on this issue disclose any error. For these reasons, we see no
    basis to interfere with the appellant’s convictions. The appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
