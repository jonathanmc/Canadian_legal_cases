style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent, a credit union, claimed it had
    suffered substantial losses, due to the dishonest and/or fraudulent acts of one
    or more of its employees.  It made a
    claim against its insurers, the appellants, who did not accept the respondent’s
    characterization of the cause of the losses and denied coverage under the terms
    of the insurance policy.  An action by
    the respondent against the appellants eventually expanded to include third,
    fourth and fifth parties.  The fourth
    parties included employees of the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent brought a motion under rules 20
    and 21 seeking summary judgment against the appellants.  That motion did not seek an order against the
    fourth parties. It is common ground that the fourth parties chose not to
    participate in the motion.  The validity
    of their reasons for not participating was a matter of dispute before me on
    this motion.  The motion judge granted
    summary judgment in favour of the respondent.  That judgment is the subject of the within appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Four of the fourth parties have brought this
    motion seeking to intervene on the appeal as added parties.  Non-participation in the matter under appeal
    is a factor to be considered in determining whether to permit intervention.  It is not an absolute bar to intervention,
    however, should the circumstances justify a different result. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied that the moving parties should be
    allowed to intervene on the terms set out in para. 10 below.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The moving parties submit that in dealing with
    the liability of the appellants, the motion judge made unanticipated,
    unwarranted and impermissible findings of credibility and fact against
    them.  Further, they submit that those
    findings may prejudice their position in the forthcoming trial between the
    remaining parties.  The moving parties
    assert that they have not made any admissions of liability and that there was
    no evidence in the record on the summary judgment motion of wrongdoing on their
    part.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge was alive to the concern that
    his judgment should not adversely affect the parties to the action who did not
    participate in the summary judgment motion.  He directed that his judgment was binding only as between the respondent
    and the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of the grounds of appeal is that the motion
    judge erred in holding that his findings do not bind the third, fourth and
    fifth parties.  The moving parties
    clearly have an interest in upholding the motion judge’s direction on this
    issue.  Moreover, the moving parties also
    argue that the motion judge’s direction may not be broad enough to protect
    their interests from findings adverse to their interest.  Thus, they submit that they have a similar
    interest to the appellants on some of the issues raised in the notice of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the moving parties and the appellants
    share some issues in common, their perspectives and interests are not wholly
    identical. The court could benefit in its analysis of the issues from these
    different perspectives.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am satisfied that the intervention of the moving
    parties on the appeal can be structured so as not to unfairly prejudice the
    respondent.  To start, the moving
    parties, as intervenors, will not be entitled to raise new issues or to broaden
    the <i>lis</i> before the court.  In addition, the intervention by the moving
    parties should not delay the hearing of the appeal.  Moreover, while the respondent may be obliged
    to reply to two factums, such effort could be accommodated in any costs order
    made in its favour.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the
    result, I am satisfied that the moving parties should be added as parties to
    this appeal on the following conditions:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They take the record as it exists and not
    seek to augment the record,</p>
  <p>2.  They may serve and file a
    factum, not to exceed 15 pages in length, on or before May 7, 2008,</p>
  <p>3.  They may participate in the
    oral argument of the appeal within the time allocated to them by the court and,
    as much as possible, not duplicate the oral argument made by the appellants,</p>
  <p>4. They may seek costs and will be liable for costs in the discretion
    of the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to
    costs of this motion, I note that the moving parties became more flexible and
    realistic as to the terms of the proposed intervention only during the oral
    argument of the motion.  Some of their
    arguments for intervention changed or were softened from their earlier
    positions.  In the circumstances, there
    will be no order for costs of this motion. </p>
