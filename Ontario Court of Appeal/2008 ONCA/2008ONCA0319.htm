  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case raises an issue about whether monies
    paid to a load broker’s trustee in bankruptcy for the shipping services of an
    independent carrier are held by the trustee in trust pursuant to the provisions
    of the<i> Load Brokers Regulation<b> </b></i>O.
    Reg. 556/92, made under the <i>Truck
    Transportation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.T.22, as amended (the
    “Regulation”).  The motion judge held that the funds, which the trustee had segregated,
    satisfied the conditions for a trust and, accordingly, must be paid to the
    carrier.  As a result, they were not
    available for distribution to the load broker’s creditors on the basis of their
    priorities under the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the <i>BIA</i>).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only
    guiding authority, was considered by the motion judge:  <i>GMAC
    Commercial Credit Corp. - Canada v. TCT Logistics Inc.</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d)
    382.  In my opinion, the motion judge correctly concluded that <i>GMAC</i> — which dealt with an interim
    receiver who collected carrier fees as required by the Regulation — also
    applies to the similarly situated trustee in bankruptcy.  As a result, and for the reasons that follow,
    I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Norame Inc. (“Norame”) carried on business as a
    load broker, arranging transportation of goods for its clients, including
    Dimplex North America Limited (“Dimplex”), by way of truck transportation.  Norame engaged Vitran Corporation (“Vitran”) as
    the carrier to ship the goods of Dimplex. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before its voluntary assignment in bankruptcy,
    Norame had co-mingled the monies it received form its shipper-customers and
    consignees with its own funds, rather than segregating those funds in a trust
    account for the carriers as required under the Regulation.  After the bankruptcy, Paddon + Yorke Inc.
    (“Paddon” or the “Trustee”), brought an application for advice and directions.  Pitt J. ordered that all monies owed by
    shippers in respect of carriage services were to be paid to the Trustee to be
    held in a separate account, pending further order of the court.  This order specified that nothing in the order
    would have the effect of giving rights that did not exist before the order was
    made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Vitran later commenced an action against Norame
    and Dimplex seeking payment of its outstanding carrier accounts.  Subsequently, Mesbur J. issued a consent
    order, which provided that, pursuant to the order of Pitt J., Dimplex pay the
    sum of $30,194.60 CDN and $10,596.23 USD to Paddon for Vitran’s shipping
    services and that Paddon deposit these monies into a separate trust
    account.  Dimplex complied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paddon brought a motion seeking a determination
    of the priority and entitlement to the funds.  On the return of the motion, Vitran argued that it was entitled to the
    funds pursuant to s. 67(1)(a) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    the Regulation and the order of Mesbur J.  Paddon argued that it held the funds for distribution to Norame’s
    creditors pursuant to the <i>BIA</i>.  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>STATUTORY
    PROVISIONS</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 67(1)(a) of the <i>BIA </i>provides that a bankrupt’s property available for distribution
    to creditors does not include “property held by the bankrupt in trust for any
    other person …”  Section 15 of the <i>Load Brokers Regulation</i> provides that
    every load broker “shall hold in trust for the benefit of the carriers to whom
    the load broker is liable” all money that the load broker receives in respect
    to the carriage of goods.  For this
    purpose, a load broker must hold the monies in a segregated trust account.</p>
  <h2>ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this appeal, the Trustee challenges the
    decision of the motion judge that Vitran
    was entitled to the monies.  In doing so,
    it raises two issues:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         Whether the trust obligations imposed
    by s. 15 of the Regulation apply to carrier fees paid to and held by a trustee
    in bankruptcy, and;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         Whether the carrier fees segregated by
    the Trustee were held in trust pursuant to s. 67(1)(a) of the <i>BIA</i>.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>GMAC</i>,
    Feldman J.A. concluded that any statutory deemed trust created by the <i>provincial</i> Regulation would not be a
    trust within the meaning of s. 67(1)(a) of the <i>federal</i> <i>BIA</i>, and thereby
    excluded from distribution to creditors, unless it otherwise conformed with the
    three common law trust principles of the certainties of intention, object, and
    subject matter.  However, Feldman J.A.
    also determined at para. 29 that a creditor’s security interest “is subject to
    the trust mandated by s. 15, so long as the debtor carries out the trust
    obligation.”  In other words, a
    creditor’s security interest does not take priority over carriers’ fees provided
    that the monies received for those fees have been segregated in a trust
    account.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Feldman J.A. also concluded at para. 36 that an
    interim receiver, who is carrying on the business of a load broker, is bound by
    the Regulation’s trust obligation with regard to carrier fees that it collects after
    the receivership’s commencement and that it is required to segregate those fees
    in trust.  This she reasoned, is because,
    irrespective of subsequent court orders, the interim receiver “stands in the
    shoes of the [load broker], and is furthermore acting as an officer of the
    court”.  Although a secured creditor’s rights in a bankrupt load broker’s accounts
    receivable are frozen upon bankruptcy, this does not apply to the carrier’s fee.  In other words, <i>GMAC</i> held that security interests do not attach to those fees, provided
    that the fees collected are properly segregated.  With these observations concerning <i>GMAC</i>, I turn to my discussion of the
    issues in this case.</p>
  <h2><i>i.          Applicability
    of the Trust Obligations of the Load Brokers Regulation to a Trustee in
    Bankruptcy</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Trustee challenges the applicability of <i>GMAC</i> primarily on the basis that, unlike
    an interim receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy does not “step into the shoes of
    the debtor or of the bankrupt”.  Rather,
    it argues, a trustee in bankruptcy is merely “an assignee of the assets of the
    debtor”, and is “neither an agent, nor a substitute of the debtor”.  Accordingly, “none of the provisions of the <i>Truck Transportation Act </i>(
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario) apply and the
    provisions of the <i>BIA</i> govern”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are several reasons for rejecting<b> </b>this argument.  First, the premise that a trustee in
    bankruptcy cannot step into the shoes of a bankrupt is erroneous.  While the role of a trustee in bankruptcy is often
    limited to effecting an orderly liquidation of the bankrupt’s assets for the
    benefit of creditors, s. 18(a) of the <i>BIA </i>explicitly empowers a trustee in bankruptcy to continue running the
    business of a bankrupt.  The trustee can
    do so on its own initiative as a conservatory measure prior to the first
    meeting of creditors, and with the permission of the inspectors thereafter (s.
    30(1)(c)).   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It makes no sense that a trustee’s obligations
    to comply with the Regulation differ depending upon whether or not it continues
    operating the load broker’s business.  If
    that were the case, a trustee continuing to operate the business could broker a
    shipper and then effectively deny that shipper its fee simply by ceasing
    operations.  That cannot be right.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the difference between an interim
    receiver and a trustee in bankruptcy advanced by the Trustee to distinguish <i>GMAC</i> is not a principled distinction
    with respect to the issue at hand.  While
    the Trustee relies on the difference between the formal status of a trustee in
    bankruptcy versus an interim receiver, it offers no plausible reason, and cites
    no authority, to explain why this difference should determine the applicability
    of the Regulation’s trust obligations.  Indeed,
    to the contrary, <i>GMAC Commercial Credit
    Corp.-Canada v. TCT Logistics Inc., </i>[2006] S.C.J. No. 36 confirmed that,
    like an interim receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy is also an officer of the
    court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly, in my view there is nothing in <i>GMAC </i>that supports the Trustee’s argument
    that the trust obligation only arises after bankruptcy provided that the
    bankrupt actually segregated carriers’ fees prior to bankruptcy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>GMAC</i> only
    holds that property held by a bankrupt that is subject to a deemed trust under
    provincial law, but not held in accordance with general trust principles, does
    not qualify under s. 67(1)(a) <i>BIA </i>for
    exclusion from distribution to creditors.  This is a different issue from whether a
    trustee in bankruptcy is required to comply with the Regulation by segregating
    the carrier fees received after the bankruptcy.  Accordingly, the Trustee has not provided a purposive
    argument in favour of its interpretation of the <i>BIA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the motion judge’s observation at para.
    7 of his reasons that a load broker’s “contractual entitlement to monies
    received from shippers is limited to its fees for such services rendered” and
    that the purpose of the Regulation is to “provide a means by which the
    contractual entitlement of a carrier can be preserved in the context of payment
    arrangements designed to ensure payment to a load broker of its fee and
    preservation of its client relationships”.  I also agree with the motion judge’s conclusion
    that the <i>BIA </i>does not entitle a load
    broker’s creditors to monies paid to its trustee in bankruptcy in respect of a
    carrier’s shipping services where those funds can be segregated in trust.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To hold otherwise would provide an unexpected and
    unfair windfall for the other creditors of a load broker.  It would also force carriers who selected the
    bankrupt load broker only as a middleman, to compete as unsecured creditors for
    the carriage fees that shippers intended they be paid.  This would produce a result entirely at odds with both the perception of the parties
    engaged in the transaction, as well as the load brokerage regime enacted by
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s legislature.  Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h2><i>ii.         Trust
    Character of the Funds Collected by the Appellant </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given my conclusion that <i>GMAC</i> applies generally to trustees in bankruptcy as it does to
    interim receivers, it is clear that the Trustee cannot succeed in its argument
    that the carrier fees it received and placed in a separate trust account lacked
    the character of trust property in accordance with general trust principles.  If the carrier fees the interim receiver in <i>GMAC</i> collected and held in trust bore
    the character of trust property, then so do the identically situated fees
    segregated by the trustee in bankruptcy in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>GMAC</i> concludes at para. 35 that, even though court orders subsequent to the
    appointment of an interim receiver “have no substantive effect on the legal
    rights of any of the parties”, neither are those rights frozen upon bankruptcy.  Similarly, the subsequent orders in this case
    have no substantive effect.  However, other
    actions and events may affect the parties’ legal rights.  One such event is the receipt by an interim
    receiver — or, in this case, a trustee in bankruptcy — of carrier fees that are
    subject to the trust obligations of the Regulation.  Accordingly, I would also reject this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the
    appeal.  In doing so, I would award costs
    of the appeal to the respondent in the amount of $8,000 inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
