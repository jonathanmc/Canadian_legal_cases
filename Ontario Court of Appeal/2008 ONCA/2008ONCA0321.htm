  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant Pauline Landen is married to Barry Landen
    (“Landen”), an accountant who took several million dollars from the estate of a
    business partner and friend, Paul Penna, that Landen was administering as
    estate trustee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once Landen’s misconduct was discovered, the
    respondents Estate Trustee During Litigation and various charities that were beneficiaries
    under the Penna will, tried to recover some of the money from Landen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a judgment released on September 21, 2007, Greer J.
    granted most of the relief sought by the respondents.  She granted partial summary judgment against
    Landen for $3,733,455.20.  She declared
    that Pauline Landen had no beneficial interest in the current matrimonial home
    because all the money used to purchase and renovate the home in the late 1990s
    had come from funds Landen had misappropriated from the Penna estate.  Finally, the motion judge refused to
    discharge the Certificate of Pending Litigation from title to the matrimonial
    home, which the appellant sought with a view to selling the home herself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Barry Landen does not appeal the motion judge’s
    order.  However, Pauline Landen does
    appeal.  She contends that the effect of
    the motion judge’s decision is to ensnare a large portion of her own money,
    approximately $565,000, in her husband’s wrongful conduct relating to the Penna
    estate.  Accordingly, she seeks
    modification of the motion judge’s order to permit recovery of this amount from
    the imminent sale of the matrimonial home.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The parties and events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basic facts in this case are outrageous and sad.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Barry Landen, an accountant, was a longtime business
    partner and friend of Paul Penna, a very successful business man in the mining
    field.  Landen worked for Penna’s company
    from 1981 to 2004.  In an affidavit filed
    in these proceedings, Landen described his relationship with Penna in this
    fashion: “Over the years, my relationship with Paul developed into more than
    that of an employer/employee, and became closer to a father/son
    relationship.  Paul and I were close and
    trusted friends.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penna died in August 1996 with an estate valued at
    about $24,000,000.  He appointed his
    wife, another business associate, and Landen as executors and trustees.  Penna also bequeathed $100,000 to Landen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost immediately, Landen managed to shunt the other
    two executors to the sidelines.  He
    started to loot the estate.  His misconduct
    was not discovered until 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An Estate Trustee During Litigation was appointed.  In 2007, Landen admitted to having taken
    $2,668,486 from the Penna estate.  It
    appears that several million additional dollars are also missing and
    unaccounted for.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of Landen’s most egregious acts was to use estate
    funds designated for many worthy charities to purchase for himself in 1997 a
    luxury residence at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    248 Forest
    Hill Road in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The purchase price was $1,185,000.  Renovations to the home cost $942,054.75.  All of this money came, directly or
    indirectly, from the Penna estate.  Title
    to the house was given to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second major misappropriation was Landen’s donation
    of $970,994.57 to the United Jewish Appeal from the Penna estae.  The UJA was not a named beneficiary in
    Penna’s will.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the new trustees of the estate and several
    charities that were beneficiaries under the Penna will commenced litigation
    against the Landens.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The motions</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September, 2007, Greer J. heard two motions together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents brought a motion for partial summary
    judgment, based in part on Landen’s admissions.  They also sought a declaration that Pauline Landen has no beneficial
    interest in the matrimonial home at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    248
    Forest Hill Road.  In response, the appellant brought a motion seeking a discharge of the
    Certificate of Pending Litigation registered against the matrimonial home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted partial summary judgment in
    favour of the respondents for $3,733,455.20, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sum of $2,127,054.75 being the amount transferred
    by him from Jakmin Investments Ltd. for the purchase of the home and for the
    renovations made to it;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    sum of $75,000.00, being the three amounts taken by Landen from the Estate of
    Paul Penna in 1997;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    sum of $282,656.00, being the monies Landen took from the Estate of Paul Penna
    for payment of the various car leases for him and family members, the computer
    service, insurance and sports tickets;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    value of 7,000 shares of AGNICO Eagle Gold Mines which Landen converted to his
    own use;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    sum of $277,750.00 being the sum Landen paid to himself as a dividend from
    Jakmin Investments Ltd.;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sum of $970,944.57 being the sum Landen improperly
    paid to the Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre, the Downtown Jewish Day School,
    and the United Jewish Fund of Toronto (the “UJA”) in breach of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also declared that the appellant had
    no beneficial interest in the matrimonial home at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    248 Forest Hill Road.  She declared that the home is held on a
    constructive trust by Landen for the Penna estate and she made a vesting order
    of title in favour of the estate.  She
    dismissed the appellant’s motion for an order discharging the Certificate of
    Pending Litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the appeal hearing, the court was informed that the
    home has been sold for $3,250,000, with a closing date of April 30, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals, principally with respect to the
    motion judge’s treatment of the current matrimonial home.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C. <u>ISSUES</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues on the appeal are:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did
    the motion judge err by imposing a constructive trust on the matrimonial home
    in favour of the estate of Paul Penna?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did
    the motion judge err by making an order vesting title to the matrimonial home
    in the estate of Paul Penna?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Did
    the motion judge err by not recognizing and making proper allowance for the
    money the appellant had contributed to the matrimonial home?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1) <u>The constructive trust issue</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had legal title to the matrimonial
    home.  The appellant submits that the
    motion judge erred by imposing a constructive trust in favour of the Penna
    estate because this constituted an improper remedy against her, albeit not
    against her husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this submission is its starting point,
    namely, that the Forest Hill home belonged to the appellant.  It did not.  Neither she nor her husband paid anything towards the purchase or
    renovations, totalling more than $2,000,000, of the home.  Every cent came from the money Landen took
    from the Penna estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this issue, the motion judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pauline Landen has no beneficial interest in the
    Forest Hill home.  She contributed not
    one cent to the purchase or the renovations.  All of the money came from the Estate of Paul Penna through her
    husband’s breach of his fiduciary duty to the Estate and its beneficiaries.  All of the money in the home can be traced to
    the source of Estate funds illegally transferred by Landen from his disposition
    of assets held by Jakmin for the Estate.  Since the money came from Landen in his capacity as a fiduciary, the
    constructive trust or express trust flows from him and the money can be traced
    from him to the house purchase and renovation.  Landen originally had his name on the Deed of Transfer, and at the last
    minute, crossed it out and put his wife’s name in his place.  Pauline therefore has no legal or beneficial
    interest in the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with this analysis.  It is entirely consistent with the leading
    case authorities and scholarly writing on the imposition of constructive
    trusts: see e.g. <i>International Corona
    Resources Ltd. v. LAC Minerals Ltd.</i> (1987), 62 O.R. (2d) 1 at para. 187 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); and Donovan W.M. Waters, Mark R. Gillen &amp;
    Lionel D. Smith, <i>Waters’ Law of Trusts in

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The
    vesting order issue</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the motion judge erred by
    making an order vesting title in the Forest Hill home in the Penna estate.  The principal argument in support of this
    submission is that the respondents did not seek this relief in their Notice of
    Motion.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the
    jurisdiction to grant a vesting order is found in s. 100 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.
    43:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>100.    A
    court may by order vest in any person an interest in      real or personal property that the court has authority to       order be disposed of, encumbered or
    conveyed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A vesting order is a discretionary remedy: see <i>Chippewas of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sarnia
    Band v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The motion judge exercised her discretion and
    vested the Forest Hill home in the estate.  In a case where the relief sought and granted was an order for sale of
    the property with the proceedings of the sale being paid to the estate in
    partial satisfaction for the money taken from the estate by Landen, both the
    constructive trust and vesting orders strike me as logical and even necessary
    precursors to the order for sale of the property.  In my view, the motion judge exercised her
    discretion in an entirely appropriate fashion.<i></i></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that even if the constructive
    trust and vesting orders were appropriate in a general sense, they fail to
    recognize and take account of some of the appellant’s money that contributed to
    the matrimonial home over the years.  There are two components to this submission.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that from June 2006 to
    September 2007 she contributed $8,100 per month to the matrimonial home to pay
    for the mortgage, a line of credit, and utilities and telephone.  She submits that the motion judge erred by
    not providing that she be reimbursed for $121,300 from any future sale of the
    home.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In
    cross-examination on her affidavit, the appellant admitted that she had made
    the mortgage payments for only four months.  Moreover, the appellant and the Landen family have lived rent-free for a
    decade in a luxury Forest Hill home.  Finally, there is personal debt of the appellant and her husband of
    approximately $1,000,000 secured against the home which the estate will have to
    pay off on closing the sale of the property.  In these circumstances, any notional entitlement the appellant might
    have to reimbursement for personal money directed towards the Forest Hill home
    is rendered nugatory by the financial benefits she has enjoyed during a decade
    of living in the home.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant contends that the family’s
    previous matrimonial home at Renaissance Court in Thornhill was sold for
    $443,000 in net proceeds and that these funds were paid into the Penna
    estate.  Accordingly, she should recover
    her share (presumably at least half) from the sale of the Forest Hill home.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with this submission is that Landen admits
    that every cent of the money used to purchase and renovate the Forest Hill home
    came from the money he misappropriated from the Penna estate.  Moreover, and crucially, the Renaissance
    Court home was not sold until about 18 months after the Forest Hill home was
    purchased.  Accordingly, there is no link
    between the money involved in the two matrimonial homes.  It follows that the motion judge did not err
    by refusing to allocate some of the projected proceeds of the sale of the
    Forest Hill home to reimburse the appellant for her share of the proceeds of
    the sale of the Renaissance Court home.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make one final observation on this issue.  With respect to the proceeds of the sale of
    the Renaissance Court matrimonial home, the door is not completely closed on
    the appellant.  The motion judge
    observed: “There is some evidence that part of the proceeds of sale of the old
    home were used to repay some monies taken from the estate but these cannot be
    traced into the Forest Hill home.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, this strikes me as precisely right.  If the appellant wants to continue to take
    the position that she has lost her share of the proceeds of the Renaissance
    Court matrimonial home she can pursue this issue against, potentially, her
    husband (a strong case, but probably irrelevant at this juncture) or the
    estate, presumably after the estate trustees, especially Landen, produce their
    accounts, which has not happened in spite of previous orders made by the motion
    judge.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal.  I would award the respondents their costs of
    the appeal fixed at $15,000 for the Estate Trustee During Litigation and $5,000
    for the charities, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.<i></i></p>
