    appellant’s fifteen year old son died when the bicycle he was riding collided
    with an automobile on a country highway near
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Consecon,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The respondents, Mr. Satrohan Lachman and Mrs. Parbatee Lachman
    are, respectively, the driver and owner of the automobile.  After a fifteen-day
    trial, this action was dismissed on the basis of the jury’s conclusion that
    the accident was not caused by any negligence on the part of the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury
    contained several errors.  The appellant asks that the judgment be set aside
    and a new trial ordered on the issue of liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the errors in the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury on the onus of proof would have confused the jury
    as to the state of the law.  This was central to the question to be decided
    by the jury and, therefore, a new trial is necessary.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 11, 1998, Shawn Busey, the appellant’s son, was riding his bicycle north
    on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Loyalist Parkway, a curved two lane highway near
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Consecon,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The highway has a posted speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour
    and a gravel shoulder.  Mr. Lachman was also driving north on the highway
    with his wife.  At approximately 11:25 a.m., Shawn’s bicycle collided with
    the Lachman vehicle.  Shawn was killed as a result of the collision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lachman testified that he was some distance away from Shawn when he first
    observed him riding on the right side of the northbound lane.  As he approached,
    he observed Shawn weaving and swerving back and forth on his bicycle.  Mr.
    Lachman decreased his speed to approximately 60 kilometres per hour and pulled
    to the left to pass.  Mr. Lachman did not sound his horn and as he reached
    Shawn, he observed him make a sharp left turn to cross the highway.  The
    evidence of Mr. Lachman and of Norman Storms, an independent witness, who
    was driving his vehicle south on the same highway, was that the bicycle essentially
    drove into the side of the motor vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lachman testified that the events happened so quickly that he did not have
    time to react.  A professional engineer testified about “perception reaction
    time” and concluded that, when the cyclist turned suddenly to the left, “Mr.
    Lachman had no time to react or take evasive action.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Storms testified that, had Mr. Lachman not collided with Shawn, the direction
    of the bicycle was such that it would have taken Shawn directly into the
    path of his southbound vehicle.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      was a relatively straightforward case centered on the issue of liability.  Although
      the appellant raises several grounds of appeal, the principal challenge
      is to the portion of the charge dealing with the onus of proof.  On the
      facts of this case, that portion of the charge was critical.  It was essential
      that  it be properly understood by the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
      midway through his charge to the jury, the trial judge explained the burden
      of proof that applied in this case.  As explained by the trial judge, because
      Mr. Lachman was operating an automobile and Shawn was riding a bicycle
      at the time of the collision, subsection 193(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 applied.  Section 193(1) reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When loss or
    damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway,
    the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not arise through the negligence
    or improper conduct of the owner, driver, lessee or operator of the motor
    vehicle is upon the owner, driver, lessee or operator of the motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge explained the effect of s. 193(1) as follows:</span></p>
 <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So it is the
    law of our province that where a motorist collides with a bicyclist or a
    pedestrian, on a highway or where his automobile causes injury, that motorist
    is presumed to be at fault and must satisfy you, the Jury, by a reasonable
    preponderance of evidence that he was not at fault or negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge later read to the jury the first question that they would be
    called upon to answer.  The question was phrased as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Has the defendant,
    Satrohan Lachman, satisfied you that the accident was not caused by any negligence
    or improper conduct on his part?  Answer “Yes” or “No”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reading the question to the jury, the trial judge then repeated, in a different
    way, that the onus was on the respondents to satisfy the jury on the preponderance
    of evidence that the driver of the automobile was not negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    later in his charge, while he was explaining the standard of care that applies
    to a driver of a motor vehicle, the trial judge contradicted and confused
    his earlier explanation of the onus.  In this portion of the charge, he started
    with the statement that the driver is “not asked to maintain a standard of
    perfection or to take extravagant precautions.  The mere fact that an accident
    has happened and damage has been sustained, does not permit you to draw an
    inference that the accident was caused by somebody’s negligence.”  Such direction
    represents a clear departure from the onus of proof established under s.
    193(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is likely that the trial judge simply misspoke at this point in his charge.  The
    instruction, however, is clearly wrong.  The trial judge compounded the error
    when, later in his charge, he set out examples of what might constitute negligence.  Specifically,
    he dealt with the duty on the driver of the motor vehicle under the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act </i>to sound the horn “whenever it is reasonably necessary to
    notify pedestrians or others, of his vehicle’s approach.”  He went on to
    state, “[i]f you are satisfied that the failure of Mr. Lachman to sound the
    horn was an effective cause or a proximate cause of the accident, then you
    should find this omission an act of negligence.”  This explanation to the
    jury may well have furthered the erroneous view that a specific act of negligence
    had to be proven by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    portion of the charge may also have served to reinforce the incorrect impression
    that the onus was on the appellant to prove that Mr. Lachman was negligent.  Prior
    to his instruction on onus of proof, the trial judge dealt with the damages
    claimed by Shawn’s mother and explained proximate cause to the jury.  In
    doing so, he stated “the evidence must not only establish that the defendant,
    Satrohan Lachman, was negligent but also that his negligence was the proximate
    cause of her injuries or damages.”  Again, this may well have confused the
    jury as to the presumption of negligence applicable in this case.  How this
    distinction could be reconciled with his instruction concerning subsection
    193(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> was not explained by the trial judge
    when he subsequently provided the instruction on the onus of proof, thereby
    serving to exacerbate the jury’s confusion on this critical legal issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of these problems, taken individually, may not have been sufficient to justify
    ordering a new trial given that, in the section dealing with the burden of
    proof, the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury on the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> provision respecting onus, and had correctly described its
    impact.  However, when these three portions of the charge are viewed together
    and the charge is read as a whole, I am not satisfied that the jury would
    have clearly understood that the burden of proof remained on the respondents
    throughout the trial, and that they (the jury) did not have to identify a
    specific breach of the duty of care (such as the failure to sound the horn)
    as the cause of the accident.  It was up to the respondents to satisfy the
    jury that, upon the whole of the evidence, Mr. Lachman was not negligent: <i>Bronson
    v. Evans and Evans</i>, [1943] O.R. 248 at 257 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents argued that the failure of the appellant’s trial counsel to object
    to these portions of the charge should be fatal to the appeal.  I disagree.  As
    set out by this court in <i>Gellie v. Naylor</i> (1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 400
    at 403 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the failure to object “does not preclude the appellant from relying on
    the misdirection, although the appellant’s contention would have been reinforced
    by a timely and appropriate objection.”  Where, as here, the error bears
    directly on the jury’s central task the failure to object will not be fatal: <i>Mizzi
    v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hopkins</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 365 at para. 50 (

    parties agree as to the appropriate standard of review that applies in appeals
    from civil jury verdicts.  Pursuant to s. 134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43, a new trial shall not be directed unless
    some “substantial wrong” or
    “miscarriage of justice” has occurred.  In a jury trial, the trial judge
    has a duty to provide the jury with a clear explanation of the law to allow
    the jury to discharge its responsibility as judge of the facts.  A substantial
    wrong, therefore, may include a charge that leaves the jury with a misapprehension
    of the applicable law, is materially deficient or fails to clearly state
    the law on a critical issue.

    risk that the charge left the jury with a misapprehension of the applicable

    deficient and constitutes a substantial wrong.  In my view, a new trial on
