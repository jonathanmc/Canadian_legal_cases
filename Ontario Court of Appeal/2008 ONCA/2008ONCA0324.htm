style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>The
    applicant is charged with first degree murder in the brutal killing of a
    fourteen year old girl.  She was detained on the tertiary grounds set out
    in s. 515(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am satisfied that the judge on the application for interim release correctly
    considered all of the circumstances, including the four factors articulated
    in s. 515(1)(c), before concluding that detention was required to maintain
    confidence in the administration of justice.  I agree with his conclusion
    and his views.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the application judge pointed out, the Crown’s case against the applicant
    appears to be very strong.  Although the applicant was not the actual killer,
    her alleged role as instigator was extremely serious, so much so that on
    the Crown’s theory her role was a <i>sine qua non</i> to the murder.  She
    persisted over a period of several months in pressuring and manipulating
    her co-accused into killing the victim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge’s reasons disclose that he was particularly alive to the
    issue of the age of the applicant, who was fifteen years old at the time
    of the offence, and the impact that detention would have on her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is now anticipated that the preliminary hearing will proceed in the summer
    of this year with the trial early next winter.  I am satisfied that, based
    on the evidence led at the bail hearing, the reasons of the application judge
    and the projected timetable for the trial, there is no reasonable prospect
    of success if this matter were to be referred to a panel of judges for reconsideration.  Accordingly,
    the motion is dismissed.</p>
