    1996 Mr. Sipos was convicted of twelve offences
    –sexual and physical assaults against a former girlfriend and two former
    wives. In March 1998, Lofchik J. declared Mr.&nbsp;Sipos a dangerous offender
    and imposed an indeterminate sentence. Mr. Sipos appealed his convictions.
    He also appealed the dangerous offender designation, but only if he were
    successful on his conviction appeal. However, his conviction appeal was dismissed
    by this court in May 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Sipos now asks to have his sentence appeal reopened and considered on its
    merits. Based on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2003),
    177 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), released after he was sentenced, Mr. Sipos submits
    that the sentencing judge erred in law by declaring him a dangerous offender
    without first considering the long-term offender provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. His application raises two questions: first, does this court have
    jurisdiction to reopen Mr. Sipos’s appeal? and second, if it does, is it
    in the interests of justice that we do so? I would answer “yes” to both questions. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      controlling principle is that this court has inherent jurisdiction to reopen
      an appeal that has not been heard and decided on its merits. See <i>R.
      v. H.(E.F.)</i>, <i>R. v. Rhingo</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 at 101
      (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Thus, the narrow question on this application is whether Mr. Sipos’s sentence
    appeal was heard and disposed of on its merits. The Crown contends that it
    was because Mr. Sipos’s sentence appeal was before this court in 2001, and
    it was open to him at that time to advance any ground he wished to challenge
    his dangerous offender designation. I do not accept the Crown’s contention.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      2001, Mr. Sipos did not argue the merits of his sentence appeal. He did
      not allege that the sentencing judge had made an error in principle or
      of law, or imposed an unfit sentence. Instead, he put his sentence appeal
      before the court simply as a vehicle to obtain relief should his conviction
      appeal succeed. Equally, this court did not address or dispose of the merits
      of Mr. Sipos’s sentence appeal. Simmons J.A., writing for the court, simply
      noted at para. 4: “[Mr. Sipos] also appeals from the dangerous offender
      designation, but only in the event of a successful appeal against conviction.” Because
      the panel dismissed the appeal against conviction, Simmons J.A. did not
      otherwise deal with the sentence appeal. The formal order of the court
      did not refer expressly to the sentence appeal. Therefore, under the principle
      in <i>Rhingo</i>, this court has jurisdiction to reopen Mr. Sipos’s sentence
      appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

      it in the interests of justice to reopen Mr. Sipos’s sentence appeal?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where
      a court has jurisdiction to reopen an appeal, it retains discretion whether
      to do so in a given case. A court should exercise its discretion to reopen
      where to do so is in the interests of justice. In my view, it is in the
      interests of justice to reopen Mr.&nbsp;Sipos’s sentence appeal for at
      least three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      Mr. Sipos has a strong appeal. The <i>Johnson</i> error – failing to consider
      the long-term offender provisions before declaring an accused a dangerous
      offender – is a serious error, rarely subject to the curative proviso in
      s. 759(3)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. In <i>Johnson </i>itself,
      Iacobucci and Arbour JJ., writing for the court, said at para. 50:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Where the error of law consists of the sentencing judge’s failure
      to consider the availability of the long-term offender provisions, it is
      only in the rarest of circumstances, if any, that there will be no reasonable
      possibility that the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence
      but for the error.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, only in “the rarest of circumstances” should a court apply the
      curative proviso. This means that Mr. Sipos is likely entitled to a new
      sentencing hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      there exists at least a possibility that a new sentencing hearing would
      produce a different result. Mr. Sipos now appears willing to participate
      in treatment programs and psychiatric assessments for his underlying disorders.
      Although the fresh evidence suggests that Mr. Sipos’s risk to reoffend
      remains high, Dr. McMaster, who provided a psychiatric opinion for this
      appeal, cannot rule out managing that risk in the community. Should this
      court order a new hearing, both parties will be entitled to lead further
      evidence about whether Mr. Sipos’s risk of re-offending can now be controlled
      in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      it would be unjust to deny Mr. Sipos an opportunity to appeal his sentence
      on the merits. He has been in prison for the last 20 years. The sentence
      he is now serving is one of the most serious deprivations of liberty our
      criminal justice system imposes. Obtaining parole is unlikely. Mr. Sipos
      should be given the opportunity to challenge his sentence, which was tainted
      by an error of law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      these reasons, I would allow the application. To the extent that the order
      of this court dismissed Mr. Sipos’s sentence appeal, I would set aside
      that order. I would grant leave to appeal sentence and order the sentence
      appeal to be listed for hearing.</span></p>
