  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this appeal, this court has the opportunity to consider, for the first time,
    whether the Ontario Review Board (the “ORB”) is a “court of competent jurisdiction”
    within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Paul Martin Conway, has been detained in various psychiatric institutions
    for 24 years since he was found not guilty by reason of insanity on a charge
    of sexual assault with a weapon on February 27, 1984.  He has spent the majority
    of this time at the maximum security unit at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge, Penetanguishine.  In August 2005, he was transferred to the Centre
    for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”), a medium-security facility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    his annual review hearing before the ORB in the summer and fall of 2006,
    the appellant applied for an absolute discharge under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    claiming, in part, that the living and disciplinary conditions under which
    he was being detained infringed his rights under <span
lang=EN-US>ss. 2(b), 2(d), 7, 8, 9 and 15(1).</span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>The
    ORB dismissed the application on the ground that it was not a “court of competent
    jurisdiction” under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the 2006 hearing, the appellant also applied for an absolute discharge on
    conventional, non-constitutional grounds. This application was dismissed
    by the ORB on the basis that the appellant posed “a significant threat to
    the safety of the public.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Conway, who appeared before us in person, appeals both findings made by the
    ORB.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also had the benefit of submissions from Michael Davies who appeared as <i>amicus
    curiae</i>.  Mr. Davies requested that the appeal be allowed and the matter
    be referred back to the ORB for a new hearing.  Counsel for CAMH and counsel
    for the Attorney General supported the ORB’s decision.  Counsel for the ORB
    restricted his submissions to the <i>Charter</i> issue.</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    circumstances of the index offence, adopted by the ORB, are described in
    the hospital record as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On September 10, 1983 at about 10:20 p.m. Mr. Conway’s
    aunt went to her sister’s home.  (It is reported by Mr. Conway’s mother that
    he and her sister, who is only 14 months older, had been engaging in consensual
    sexual activities from a very young age).  When she arrived, she found her
    nephew, Mr. Conway, in the house by himself.  He offered some drinks and
    she accepted.  They drank for about 30 minutes and when his aunt went to
    the kitchen area, he told her that he was intend[ing] to have sexual intercourse
    with her and that there was nothing that she could do about it.  He told
    her that he had sent everyone away from the house earlier and that he had
    pre-planned the event.  He then grabbed a knife from the countertop and held
    it to her throat.  She tried to get away, managing to run to the front door,
    but he pulled her back by the hair.  He dragged her to the bedroom and told
    her to take her clothes off.  She complied and got undressed and he then
    told her to lie on the bed.  He then got undressed and had sexual intercourse
    with his aunt.  While having intercourse, he was talking in a crazy way about
    other women.  He then forced his aunt to perform fellatio for about two hours
    and then had intercourse with her again.  After this he became very calm
    and stated that this was just something that he had to do.  He then let her
    get dressed and gave her money for a taxi which she took.  At about 3:00
    a.m. the following morning the victim noticed a police car and made an official
    complaint.  Mr. Conway was arrested at 5:30 a.m. the same morning.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Apparently, during his childhood and teens the victim
    of the offence had frequent sexual contact with Mr. Conway.  This lasted
    until Mr. Conway was seventeen when apparently she married and moved away.  It
    was reported by Mr. Conway’s mother that he had been behaving in a rather
    odd way for two months preceding the offence.  Mr. Conway’s mother reported
    that he ‘doesn’t trust anybody, seems to be really paranoid’
    and had been spending most of his time at her home.  She reported that it
    was as if he did not want to leave her, as if he needed her for security.  Mr.
    Conway’s mother reported ‘he feels everyone is against him’.  He had been
    talking about doing away with himself and others, including his own family.  He
    had also been complaining about hearing voices in his head and seemed to
    be indulging in some ritualistic behaviour.  Mr. Conway’s mother described
    that he would touch a specific table and would come back and keep touching
    it and then walk away and come back and touch it again.  He also was reported
    to have a phobia for eating utensils and people and was fearful of the number
    13.  He also wanted all the calendars in the house taken down.  His mother
    suggested that he seek psychiatric help but Mr. Conway did not feel that
    would be of assistance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Conway has stated that he does not think that
    he was mentally ill at the time of the index offence and that he pretended
    to be mentally ill in order to obtain a verdict of not guilty by reason of
    insanity.  He claims that his lawyer gave him wrong advice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Amicus
      curiae</i> provided a summary of certain kinds of inappropriate, antisocial
      and unlawful behaviour of Mr. Conway – taken from the hospital report filed
      at the hearing.  The summary includes the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Conway is said to ‘sexualize’ his relationship with female staff members:
    this has included sending cards with sexually explicit messages (1984/85),
    showing his penis to staff, masturbating in their view, making sexual comments,
    slapping the cleaner’s buttocks (1986/89); making sexual advances to staff
    (1990/91); making inappropriately affectionate phone calls to staff (1992/93);
    staring at female staff and invading their personal space (1993/94); making
    sexually suggestive remarks to female staff and openly fondling his crotch
    while staring at female staff, kissing the Patient Advocate on the head and
    speaking to her in inappropriate sexual language (1995/96); appearing sexually
    aroused around staff (1995/96); displaying his erect penis to visiting volunteers
    (1996/97); being sexually aggressive with female staff and exposing an erect
    penis through a hole in his pants (1997/98); making sexually inappropriate
    comments (1999/2001); becoming fixated on a female patient advocate (2002/03).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it
    is also alleged in the Hospital Report that he sexually harassed female patients
    (1989/90) and two female patients claimed he had made sexual propositions
    to them and sexually molested them (1992/93), although no charges appear
    to have resulted.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    is repeatedly described as verbally abusive or verbally aggressive to staff
    and having frequent ‘verbal outbursts’.  On many occasions he has been restrained
    and secluded because of irritable or explosive behaviour (<i>e.g.</i> 1999/01,
    2001/02, 2002/03).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    is described as not following the ward rules and being extremely difficult
    to manage (<i>e.g. </i>1996/97).  One example shows that from the period
    May 1, 2003, to November 1, 2003, that there were 33 episodes of verbal abuse
    towards co-patients, 42 incidents of verbal abuse towards staff, 35 incidents
    of sexually inappropriate behaviour ranging from boastful statements about
    his prowess and magnetism to blatant sexual harassment and 14 incidents of
    specific threats of bodily harm to others.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    is repeated reference in the Hospital Report to threats of harm [and death]
    to others, including staff and Mr. Conway’s own family members. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    has occasionally hoarded urine and faeces in his room (1990/91, 1992/93),
    and occasionally gone on hunger strikes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    has shown delusional behaviours and paranoia with respect to Hospital food.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    appears in constant fear of homosexual attacks from male staff members to
    the point that he has slept underneath his bed rather than on it.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    makes repeated threats to report staff to their professional organizations
    and makes occasional reports to the Ontario Provincial Police.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although
    allegations of physical assault are significantly less [frequent] than verbal
    assaults, the Hospital Report does record some physical incidents including
    ‘physical threats and assaults’ (1986/89) although little or no detail is
    given with respect to these physical assault allegations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Over
    the years, it has become the opinion of the majority of mental health professionals
    assessing and treating Mr. Conway that antipsychotic medication is a necessary
    precondition for any successful course of treatment.  Nevertheless, he has
    consistently refused such drug therapy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    noted above, Mr. Conway has been at the medium security CAMH since August
    2005.  While at CAMH, his hospital record notes the following behaviour:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>overly
    familiar interactions with female staff;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>extreme
    homophobic attitudes with a fear of being raped;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>making
    threats of reporting staff to various organizations;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>difficulty
    with co-patients; and,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>becoming
    agitated and on one occasion threatening to hurt anyone who came near him
    with the cutlery he had in his hand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Conway’s attending psychiatrist at CAMH, Dr. Padraig Darby, testified at
    the ORB hearing.  It was Dr. Darby’s opinion that Mr. Conway represented
    a real and substantial danger to the public.  Dr. Darby testified that Mr.
    Conway continues to suffer from a major mental disorder.  The ORB summarized
    Dr. Darby’s evidence in respect of Mr. Conway’s disruptive behaviour:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Dr. Darby made clear his opinion that over the past
    year only the structure of the medium secure unit at CAMH has permitted Mr.
    Conway’s verbal assault from becoming physical attacks upon others.  The
    doctor provided several examples of Mr. Conway’s extremely disruptive behaviour
    over the past year at CAMH, all resulting in it becoming necessary to keep
    Mr. Conway segregated from other patients on a periodic basis … </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart
    from this rather negative view of Mr. Conway’s behaviour, Dr. Darby testified
    that Mr. Conway appeared to be somewhat better at CAMH than at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge.  At CAMH, there had been no physical assaults in the past year
    and no incidents of public masturbation, exhibiting his penis or sexual propositions
    to female staff.  At CAMH, he had started to take an anger management course.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    taking an overall view of Mr. Conway’s condition, Dr. Darby opined that his
    mental state had not improved since 1984 and, if anything, his condition
    had deteriorated.  Dr. Darby’s opinion is that Mr. Conway is in a “therapeutic
    bind”.  There is a treatment impasse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    his previous review hearing in 2005, the treatment impasse emerged as one
    of the reasons that the ORB transferred Mr. Conway to CAMH.  In 2005, the
    ORB said in its reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Because of his perception of things; because of
    the impasse which has built up over the years as between himself and many
    of the people employed at Oak Ridge, some of which impasse was of his own
    making of course, we are of the unanimous view that he should be transferred
    once again to a medium secure institution.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ORB in 2005 concluded its reasons by expressing a hope that some innovative
    program would be found for Mr. Conway to break the impasse and lead to his
    release into the community:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We sincerely hope that in the future some innovative
    program which is tailored to meet his specific needs will be worked out and
    applied for and to Mr. Conway so that at some point in time, and in the not
    too distant future at that, he will find himself being released to live once
    again in the community.  He needs to be given hope.  Instead he has lost
    hope and is in a constant state of depression and despair.  It is put that
    an extra effort should be made to create some program specifically tailored
    to meet his obvious needs so that his hoped for recovery can be achieved.  We
    are also aware of course that any such measures will be to no avail unless
    Mr. Conway is prepared to cooperate.  </p>

    Ron Langevin, an expert in forensic psychology, testified on behalf of Mr.
    Conway.  It was his opinion that Mr. Conway was a risk to the public and
    that continued detention at CAMH was the appropriate disposition.  It was
    Dr. Langevin’s view that Mr. Conway had experienced significant changes in
    emotional/personality functioning following a car accident when he was 17
    years old.  In the accident, he was struck on the right side of his head.  Neurophysiological
    tests suggested right hemisphere deficits of the brain.  Dr. Langevin declined
    to offer a diagnosis for Mr. Conway.  However, he was critical of the treatment
    approach being taken by Dr. Darby and his team.  Dr. Langevin recommended,
    among other things, further neurological testing and a client-centred behavioural
    approach which would include setting goals, taking sexual abuse counselling
    and increased family visits.  He also recommended referral to a consultant
    outside the hospital, given Mr. Conway’s mistrust of the staff at CAMH.</p>

    its reasons for decision, the ORB described the diagnoses made by various
    specialists who have attempted to treat Mr. Conway as including: Psychotic
    Disorder NOS (not otherwise specified); Personality Disorder (mixed, with
    paranoid, borderline and narcissistic features); Query Post-Traumatic Stress
    Disorder; and, Query Paraphilia.</p>

    Mr. Conway testified, he repeated his long-held denial of mental illness
    and denied that he was a violent person.  He refused to discuss antipsychotic
    medication.  He indicated that he was prepared to take anger management counselling
    and sexual abuse counselling.  </p>

    for Mr. Conway, at the ORB, filed a Notice of Constitutional Question in
    which she alleged that many of Mr. Conway’s <i>Charter</i> rights had been
    violated and sought relief under s. 24(1) by way of an absolute discharge.  First,
    she alleged that the living and disciplinary conditions under which Mr. Conway
    was being detained violated s. 7.  Second, she asserted that this continuing
    violation of s. 7 had completely undermined Mr. Conway’s potential to therapeutically
    benefit from the continued detention.  Finally, she alleged that the continued
    detention violated Mr Conway’s rights under ss. 2(b), 2(d), 7, 8, 9 and 15(1).  At
    the eight-day hearing before the ORB, a significant amount of time was spent
    dealing with the <i>Charter </i>application.  </p>
  <h2>The ORB Decision on the Merits</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dismissing his application for an absolute discharge on non-constitutional
    grounds, the ORB said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the totality of [the] evidence … we all agree
    that Mr. Conway continues to present as a real and substantial danger to
    the public at this time.  That danger lies in his continuing paranoid and
    delusional ideation.  He continues to persist in venting his threats of violent
    aggression toward others.  He continues to physically intimidate others by
    his physical gesticulations and mannerisms.  His clinical condition remains
    untreated, notwithstanding the attempts by his current team of caregivers
    at CAMH to treat it.  His risk further lies in his high actuarial scores
    for violent recidivism within a fixed period of time.  Even the lowest score
    obtained by Mr. Conway’s psychologist Dr. Langevin, certainly cannot be ignored.  Mr.
    Conway can actually be in our view described at the present time as an egocentric,
    impulsive bully with a poor to absent ability to control his own behaviour.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We all agree that more probably than not, if released
    to live in the public domain on any basis, within a very short time, Mr.
    Conway would find himself in police custody and immediately thereafter in
    all likelihood back in a mental health hospital facility.  He has refused
    antipsychotic medication.  Until the virtual eve of this hearing he has refused
    hospital offered programs.  We therefore conclude on a unanimous basis that
    sadly the least restrictive disposition to be made with respect to Mr. Conway
    at the present time is his detention in a medium secure unit of a mental
    health hospital facility.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The hope for Mr. Conway’s progress as expressed
    in last year’s reasons has obviously not occurred.  On the evidence before
    us we are not prepared to attach responsibility for that unfortunate failure
    on either Mr. Conway’s hospital team of caregivers, the CAMH hospital police,
    or the CAMH hospital rules, its hiring practices and certainly not Dr. Darby.  It
    may well be that one or more members of the accused’s treating team at the
    ward level may not have been temperamentally suited to withstand Mr. Conway’s
    incessant harassment and his obstructionistic tactics.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board went on to indicate that a renewed treating team might recommend Mr.
    Conway to participate meaningfully in anger management and sexual assault
    prevention programs.  The ORB also suggested consideration be given to escorted
    hospital and grounds privileges.  Finally, the ORB suggested a thorough investigation
    on whether Mr. Conway has or has not sustained brain damage resulting from
    a car accident many years ago.  </p>
  <h2>The ORB Decision on the <i>Charter</i> Application</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board concluded that it was not a court or tribunal “of competent jurisdiction”
    to grant a <i>Charter </i>remedy pursuant to s. 24.  The ORB relied in part
    on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Mooring v. Canada</i> <i>(National
    Parole Board)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 75 in which the court held that the National
    Parole Board did not have jurisdiction to grant a remedy under s. 24(2) of

    to the National Parole Board”.  </p>

    main thrust of the submission made by <i>amicus curiae</i> is that the ORB
    erred in law in failing to inquire fully into the failure of CAMH to put
    in place some innovative program tailored to Mr. Conway’s needs.  His other
    arguments flow from this submission.  The alternative submission of <i>amicus

style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from reading the ORB’s reasons for decision that it was alive to
    the treatment impasse and the approach taken by Dr. Darby and his team at
    CAMH.  The Board refused to attribute Mr. Conway’s lack of progress since
    2005 to his treatment team, suggesting instead that progress was more likely
    impeded by “Mr. Conway’s incessant harassment and his obstructionistic tactics.”  The
    ORB adverted to its reasons for decision from 2005, including its expression
    of “hope that in the future some innovative program which is tailored to
    meet [Mr. Conway’s] specific needs will be worked out…”  Finally, the ORB,
    in its reasons, suggested continued anger management counselling for Mr.
    Conway, escorted hospital and grounds privileges and “a thorough investigation
    on the issue of whether Mr. Conway has or has not sustained brain damage
    resulting from … [a] car accident that occurred … years ago.”  Unfortunately,
    as discussed below, these suggestions did not find expression in the ORB’s
    formal disposition.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ORB did not explicitly address the clear treatment impasse in its formal
    disposition order.  In my view, given the impasse and the 24-year detention,
    it was incumbent on the Board to do so.  Although the ORB made several suggestions
    in terms of dealing with the impasse in its reasons for disposition, as indicated,
    it failed to include any related conditions in its formal disposition order.   The
    failure to do so was, in my view, unreasonable.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    power of Review Boards to place conditions in their formal disposition orders
    was discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the following terms in <i>Mazzei
    v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services)</i>, <span class=canliicitation>[2006]
    1 S.C.R. 326 at para. 39:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Although Review Boards may not actually
      prescribe or impose a particular course of medical treatment for an NCR
      accused, they still possess the authority to make orders and conditions
      in a “supervisory” role or capacity with respect to the NCR accused’s medical
      treatment and clinical progress. Review Boards are in effect empowered
      to make orders and conditions “related to” or “regarding” an NCR accused’s
      medical treatment (or the supervision of such treatment) while in the custody
      of a provincial hospital; Review Boards also have the power … to make such
      orders and conditions binding on all parties involved, including hospital
      authorities. … [These] ensure that the NCR accused is provided with opportunities
      for appropriate and effective medical treatment, in order to help reduce
      the risk to public safety and to facilitate rehabilitation and community
      reintegration. The scope of this power would arguably include anything
      short of actually prescribing that treatment be carried out by hospital
      authorities. It would therefore include the power to require hospital authorities
      and staff to question and reconsider past or current treatment plans or
      diagnoses, and explore alternatives which might be more effective and appropriate.</span></p>

    the present case, the ORB was faced with an NCR accused suffering a clear
    treatment impasse and the possibility of many further years of involuntary
    detention beyond the 24 years already passed.  On reading the formal disposition
    order and the reasons that justify it, it appears that the Board overlooked
    the important role of its order-making power in these circumstances.  <i>Mazzei </i>highlights
    this importance at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>[<i>I</i>]<i>f there is a treatment
    “impasse”, then a Board’s function could not be properly carried out unless

    would therefore allow the appeal on the merits and remit the matter back

    do not think that the <i>Martin </i>test for determining whether an administrative
    tribunal has jurisdiction under s. 52(1) of the <i>Constitution Act</i>, <i>1982</i> –<i> </i>to
    hold a provision of its enabling statute unconstitutional – can simply be
    transferred to the analysis arising under s. 24(1).  Indeed, the Supreme
    Court explained its test in <i>Martin </i>in the following terms (at para.
    28): </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Where a tribunal is] endowed with the power to
    consider questions of law relating to a [statutory] provision, that power
    will normally extend to assessing the constitutional validity of that provision.  This
    is because the consistency of a provision with the Constitution is a question
    of law arising under that provision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>Mr. Conway does not attack the constitutional validity of any provision in
    Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Instead, he asserts that the conditions
    under which he has been detained infringe his <i>Charter </i>rights.  In
    my view, where <i>Charter</i> allegations impugn state or administrative
    action, as opposed to the validity of a statutory provision, the test from <i>Martin </i>is
    inapplicable.  </p>

    v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission)</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 22,
    where the Supreme Court highlighted the distinction between s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter </i>and
    s. 52(1) of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i> (at p. 31):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… I should point out … that like <i>Douglas College</i> and <i>Cuddy
      Chicks</i>, this case does <u>not</u> involve the application of s. 24(1)
      of the<i> Charter</i> and the consequent need for a determination of whether
      the tribunal is a ‘court of competent jurisdiction’
    within the meaning of that section.  In particular, the respondent does not
    seek … any remedy that would require the invocation of s. 24(1).  All she
    is asking is that the Board of Referees disregard s. 31 when calculating
    the benefits that would otherwise be due her under the Act … [I]n the present
    case it is s. 52(1) of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i> that is being relied
    upon by the respondent, rather than s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

    in <i>Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission)</i>, [2003] 2
    S.C.R. 585, the Supreme Court held that the <i>Martin</i> test dealing with
    s. 52(1) –
    rather than the <i>Mills</i> test under s. 24(1) – applies to determine whether
    a tribunal has jurisdiction to apply s. 35(1) of the <i>Constitution Act,
    1982</i> (dealing with aboriginal rights) at paras. 39 and 40:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… I am of the view that the approach set out in <i>Martin</i>,
    in the context of determining a tribunal’s power to apply the <i>Charter</i> [to
    determine the validity of a statutory provision], is also the approach to
    be taken in determining a tribunal’s power to apply s. 35 of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1982</i>.  The essential question is whether the empowering legislation
    implicitly or explicitly grants to the tribunal the jurisdiction to interpret
    or decide any question of law …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… [T]his Court has already recognized that the power
    to find a statutory provision of no effect, by virtue of s. 52(1) of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1982</i>, is distinct from the remedial power to invoke s. 24(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i>: <i>T</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span></i><i>trault-Gadoury
    v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission)</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 22,

    the same question: Was there a ‘court of competent jurisdiction’ for the
    purposes of s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>? … The inquiry in those cases,
    and prior ones, such as <i>Mills v. The Queen</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, arises
    from the term ‘court of competent jurisdiction’ in s. 24(1).  The test developed
    for applying that term should not, in my view, be taken as suggesting that, <i><u>outside
    that unique context</u></i>, there will be lines drawn between the kinds
    of constitutional questions that a tribunal is able to hear.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    I find that this conclusion is supported by the reasons for judgment of the
    majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Mooring</i>.  In that case,
    Sopinka J. for the majority, said (at para 24):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Even assuming that the Parole Board has jurisdiction
    over the party and the subject matter, I am satisfied, on the basis of (i)
    the structure and function of the Board and (ii) the language of the Board’s

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I take a similar view of the jurisdiction

    his analysis under the third branch of the <i>Mills</i> test, Sopinka J.,
    as indicated above, adopted a functional and structural approach.  He identified
    several factors in the function and structure of the Parole Board which led
    him to conclude that the Board did not have the authority to grant the remedy
    sought – the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    functional and structural approach was adopted and refined by Chief Justice
    McLachlin in <i>974649 Ontario Inc.</i>  The following excerpts from her
    reasons for judgment provide a useful guideline to this approach:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[35] … <span lang=EN-US>The paramount question remains
      whether the court or tribunal, by virtue of its function and structure,
      is an appropriate forum for ordering the <i>Charter</i> remedy in issue  </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[44]     The function of the court or tribunal is
    an expression of its purpose or mandate. As such, it must be assessed in
    relation to both the legislative scheme and the broader legal system. First,
    what is the court or tribunal's function within the legislative scheme? Would
    jurisdiction to order the remedy sought under s. 24(1) frustrate or enhance
    this role? How essential is the power to grant the remedy sought to the effective
    and efficient functioning of the court or tribunal? Second, what is the function
    of the court or tribunal in the broader legal system? Is it more appropriate
    that a different forum redress the violation of <i>Charter</i> rights?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[45]     The inquiry into the structure of the court
    or tribunal relates to the compatibility of the institution and its processes
    with the remedy sought under s. 24. Depending on the particular remedy in
    issue, any or all of the following factors may be salient: whether the proceedings
    are judicial or quasi-judicial; the role of counsel; the applicability or
    otherwise of traditional rules of proof and evidence; whether the court or
    tribunal can issue subpoenas; whether evidence is offered under oath; the
    expertise and training of the decision-maker; and the institutional experience
    of the court or tribunal with the remedy in question: see <i>Mooring</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 25-26. Other relevant considerations may include the workload of
    the court or tribunal, the time constraints it operates under, its ability
    to compile an adequate record for a reviewing court, and other such operational
    factors. The question, in essence, is whether the legislature or Parliament
    has furnished the court or tribunal with the tools necessary to fashion the
    remedy sought under s. 24 in a just, fair and consistent manner without impeding
    its ability to perform its intended function. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]     </span><span lang=EN style='"Times New Roman";color:black;'>Two
      sources may provide guidance in determining the function and structure
      of a court or tribunal: the language of the enabling legislation and the
      history and accepted practice of the institution. The court or tribunal's
      constituting legislation may clearly describe its function and structure.
      However, it often may be necessary to consider other factors to fully appreciate
      the court or tribunal’s function, or the strengths and limitations of its
      processes. Factors like the workload of the court or tribunal, the time
      constraints it operates under, and its experience and proficiency with
      a particular remedy, cannot be assessed on the face of the relevant legislation
      alone; rather, regard must be had to the day-to-day practice of the court
      or tribunal in question.</span></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Mooring</i>,
    the presence of these structural characteristics in the context of the National
    Parole Board were relevant because they indicated that “neither the Board
    itself nor the proceedings in which it engages [were] designed to engage
    in the balancing of factors that s. 24(2) demands”:  <i>Mooring</i>, at para.
    26.  In my view, this reasoning applies equally in the present context.  A
    s. 24(1) remedy is one that is “appropriate and just in the circumstances”,
    and this requires “taking into account the sometimes … opposing concerns
    of fairness to the individual, societal interests, and the integrity of the
    judicial system”:  Hogg, <i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i>, looseleaf<i> </i>(Scarborough:  Carswell,
    1984) at para. 40-36, citing <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 at
    para. 69.  In the case at bar, the decision to grant the appellant an absolute
    discharge, to remedy <i>Charter </i>breaches occasioned by his detention
    as a mentally disordered accused who continues to pose a significant risk
    to the public, involves the balancing of factors that neither the ORB, nor
    its proceedings, were designed to address.  Therefore, as in <i>Mooring</i>,
    I find that the ORB lacks the structural competence to engage in the balancing
    exercise that would be required to grant an absolute discharge as a <i>Charter </i>remedy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    building on this, I also emphasize that Parliament intended for the ORB to
    have only limited remedial access to absolute discharges.  Under s. 672.54
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, absolute discharges are only available where
    an accused <span lang=EN-US>“is not a significant threat to the safety of
    the public.”  Therefore, to find plenary jurisdiction in the ORB to grant
    absolute discharges under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> </span>would “frustrate”
    the system established in part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This strongly
    suggests that the ORB’s function is not compatible with the remedy sought
    in this case.  See, <i>974649 Ontario Inc., supra</i>, at para. 44. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    given the ORB’s statutory jurisdiction, <i>Charter </i>jurisdiction to grant
    absolute discharges is entirely unnecessary.  The only circumstance in which
    an NCR accused would ever need to invoke the <i>Charter </i>to receive an
    absolute discharge is one in which such a remedy would, in any event, be
    unavailable.<i>  </i>An NCR accused would only ever seek an absolute discharge
    under the <i>Charter</i> in circumstances where the ORB has first found him
    or her to be a significant threat; this follows from the fact that the ORB
    is <i>required</i> by the <i>Criminal Code</i> to absolutely discharge any
    accused who is not dangerous: see s. 672.54.  Given that an absolute discharge
    in relation to a significantly dangerous accused cannot, in my view, be an “appropriate
    and just” remedy under s. 24(1), I find it difficult to imagine a scenario
    whereby the ORB’s function could ever be enhanced by recognizing <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction
    to grant absolute discharges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    the jurisdiction granted to the ORB by the <i>Criminal Code </i>also renders <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction
    unnecessary in many other situations.  For example, Mr. Conway alleges <i>Charter </i>breaches
    concerning the use of unfair seclusion, excessive confinement and inadequate
    treatment.  However, these issues can and should be addressed through the
    ORB’s statutory jurisdiction to supervise Mr. Conway’s treatment.  As noted
    above, the ORB has order-making power that it is required to employ in rendering
    a disposition that is “least onerous and least restrictive” having regard
    to, <i>inter alia</i>, the “needs of the accused.”  It is trite law that
    courts and tribunals should not address constitutional issues where non-constitutional
    remedies are sufficient.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in my view, the ORB simply lacks the resources to properly hold remedial
    jurisdiction under s. 24(1).  The Board is required to conduct annual hearings
    for each accused.  According to its counsel, the ORB held 1,454 hearings
    in 2006 for 1,181 persons.  Annual hearings are usually scheduled at the
    rate of four per day, five days a week.  As already noted, Mr. Conway’s hearing
    took eight days. As counsel for the ORB has observed, a significant amount
    of time was taken up with his <i>Charter</i> application.  I note that this
    observation was not questioned by any other party on appeal.  This leads
    me to question whether ORB <i>Charter </i>jurisdiction would “frustrate the
    otherwise informal and expeditious nature of its hearings”:  Barrett and
    Shandler, <i>Mental Disorder in Canadian Criminal Law</i>, looseleaf<i> </i>(
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto:  Carswell, 2006) at para. 7-18.  I note here that s. 672.5(2) of
    the <i>Code </i>provides that hearings “may be conducted in as informal a
    manner as is appropriate in the circumstances.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the <i>Criminal Code </i>does not expressly impose on the ORB strict timelines
    for dispositional decisions, the Board’s “accepted practice” – to use the
    language of the Supreme Court in <i>974649 Ontario Inc., </i>at para. 46 – of
    conducting four hearings per day suggests to me that <i>Charter </i>jurisdiction
    would add a significant additional burden to an already overburdened tribunal.  Indeed,
    the experience of the criminal courts with <i>Charter </i>applications is
    that they significantly prolong trials.  This is a legitimate concern.  As
    the Supreme Court instructed in <i>974649</i> <i>Ontario Inc. </i>at para.
    46:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Factors like the workload of the court

      to the day-to-day practice of the court or tribunal in question. [Emphasis
      added.]</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    2006 ORB disposition under appeal ordered Mr. Conway’s continued detention.  However,
    the Board attached no conditions regarding Mr. Conway’s medical treatment.  As
    I will explain, in my view, it was both an error of law and unreasonable
    for the Board not to impose conditions in light of the uncontradicted evidence
    that, despite 24 years of detention, Mr. Conway had received no effective
    treatment.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and add conditions to the
    Board’s disposition in line with the “suggestions” made by the Board in its
    reasons.  As well, I would return the matter to the ORB for further consideration
    of appropriate additional conditions.</p>

    J., writing for the Supreme Court of Canada, concluded that these conditions
    were consistent with the purpose of Part XX.1 of the <i>Code</i>.  Referring
    to <i>Winko </i><i><span lang=EN-US>v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1999),
    135 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.), Bastarache J. described the purpose of the
    legislation at para. 9. He explained that the legislation is designed </span>“to
    create a mechanism by which Review Boards assess and manage the risk to public
    safety represented by certain NCR accused persons, and craft appropriate
    disposition orders which protect society <u>and facilitate the medical treatment
    of the accused, while restricting their liberty as little as possible.</u>” [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bastarache
    J. held that the authority to include conditions regarding medical treatment
    was consistent with the legislative structure. The legislation suggests that “Boards
    should supervise the process of implementing a disposition order or condition”, which allows
    for the provision of opportunities for appropriate medical treatment.  Bastarache
    J. explained that this function of the Review Boards addresses the interrelated
    nature of the objectives of the legislation at para. 33: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus, the role of Review Boards is merely to ensure
    that <i>opportunities</i> for medical treatment are provided to an NCR accused,
    where necessary and appropriate, with a view to reducing the level of risk
    (see <i>Winko</i>, at para 41). Providing opportunities for effective medical
    treatment furthers the objective of public safety by attempting to reduce
    the safety risk posed by the NCR accused; it also furthers the objective
    of safeguarding the accused's liberty interests by working towards community
    reintegration and the cessation of most if not all restrictions on the accused's
    liberty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Bastarache J. also explained that, while Review Boards have the power to
    make conditions “‘regarding’ or ‘supervising’
    [a NCR patient’s] medical treatment”, they may not “actually prescribe such
    treatment or require that it be provided by hospital staff” (para. 30).  This
    is because the prescription or imposition of medical treatment falls within
    a hospital’s authority.  Nonetheless, Review Boards have the jurisdiction
    to require a reconsideration of a treatment plan and an exploration of alternatives
    for effective treatment (para. 39).  This is consistent with the reasoning
    in <i>Winko</i> that a NCR patient is not a criminal, but an ill person.  In <i>Winko</i>,
    McLachlin J. (as she was then) observed at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The assessment-treatment model introduced by Part
    XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is fairer to the NCR offender than the traditional
    common law model. The NCR offender is not criminally responsible, but ill. <u>Providing
    opportunities to receive treatment, not imposing punishment, is the just
    and appropriate response</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Mazzei </i>at
    para. 42, Bastarache J. addressed the importance of a Review Board arriving
    at an “independent opinion” about a patient’s progress and treatment plan.  He
    observed that “a Board's function could not be properly carried out unless
    it were able to impose conditions to deal with [a] lack of progress [in treatment]
    and to seek out more effective treatment opportunities.”  See also

    in hospital for more than 24 years, since a finding that he was not criminally
    responsible for a serious sexual assault.  During the two months preceding
    that assault, Mr. Conway had been showing signs of illness by behaving oddly,
    hearing voices, and displaying paranoia.  In earlier years, Mr. Conway suffered
    significant and prolonged sexual abuse by an uncle, which left him in fear
    of males.  Mr. Conway was also involved in a serious car accident, which
    may have caused brain damage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    there apparently have been no acts of physical assault, Mr. Conway’s behaviour
    during his detention has been uncooperative, abusive, demanding, threatening,
    intimidating, harassing, and difficult in the extreme.  This has made the
    responsibilities of his treatment teams frustrating and unpleasant.  Despite
    all the evidence to the contrary, Mr. Conway denies that he suffers from
    a major mental disorder.  In addition, it is unclear whether his condition
    stems from problems with his brain circuitry, brain damage, sexual abuse,
    or some combination of the three.  He has refused antipsychotic medication
    and, for the most part, has refused other medications and recommended therapies.  </p>

    both institutions were frustrated, as was the 2006 Review Board, by the lack
    of progress in Mr. Conway’s treatment.  The Board’s detailed reasons acknowledge
    the treatment impasse. The reasons also recognize the

      to Mr. Conway to “conduct himself in a civilized manner”.  The Board observed
      that, but for his NCR status, Mr. Conway’s conduct at CAMH amounted to
      legal criminal harassment.  The Board described him as an “egocentric,
      impulsive bully with a poor to absent ability to control his own behaviour”.  The
      Board referred to an
    “unfair vilification” of his current male psychiatrist and observed that

      language by the Board raises two concerns, particularly when considered
      in the context of the Board’s defence of Mr. Conway’s treatment team.  First,
      it does not explain whether, in the Board’s view, Mr. Conway’s conduct
      arises from his brain disorder or whether he is simply an obnoxious individual
      who, if roundly chastised, will see the light and cooperate in the future,
      despite 24 years of non-cooperation.  For me, the distinction is important
      since the evidence suggests that Mr. Conway likely cannot control his behaviour
      without treatment.  Second, the language chosen by the Board may exacerbate,
      albeit unintentionally, the treatment impasse by placing blame and pitting
      patient against treatment team.  Increasing discord between individuals
      who must work together on a daily basis will likely hinder a resolution
      of current problems. </span></p>

    Langevin, a widely recognized psychologist, testified on Mr. Conway’s behalf
    about treatments other than medication.  He noted positive signs, including
    Mr. Conway’s expressed agreement to take both an anger management course
    and to accept sexual abuse group counselling.  As well, Mr. Conway testified
    that he would agree to accept “one-to-one therapy”.  Dr. Langevin attested
    to the need for a treatment plan structured by an outside consultant that
    would assist Mr. Conway with his anxiety, especially his anxiety about males.  Input
    from an independent consultant would also serve to address Mr. Conway’s clear
    antipathy to his male treating psychiatrist and his distrust of CAMH staff.  By
    including positive reinforcements, a plan could encourage Mr. Conway to achieve
    set goals.  Dr. Langevin’s recommendations were neither accepted nor rejected
    by the Board.  </p>

    only treatment-related condition referenced by the Board was a general one
    located in the preamble to the Board’s disposition, providing that CAMH create
    a program for “the detention in custody and rehabilitation of [Mr. Conway]”.  No
    conditions provided <i>Mazzei­-</i>type guidance regarding treatment.  The
    Board’s reasons did contain some “suggestions”.  These included recommendations
    for a thorough investigation to determine whether Mr. Conway sustained any
    brain damage, for a “renewed treating team”

    my view, the Board’s failure to impose conditions was in error and unreasonable
    in light of its mandate to supervise the patient’s detention and the lack
    of progress in Mr. Conway’s treatment in the preceding year.  It was also
    incumbent on the Board to specifically consider Dr. Langevin’s proposed conditions.  If
    the Board had reason to refuse to attach those conditions regarding treatment

    turn next to Mr. Conway’s <i>Charter</i> application.  I agree with Armstrong
    J.A.’s conclusion that the remedy of an absolute discharge is not available
    on this record.  Given Mr. Conway’s dangerousness, such a remedy would not
    be “appropriate and just”
    within the meaning of s. 24(1).  However, I do not agree with Armstrong J.A.’s

    analysis is guided by the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Mills
    v. The Queen</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 and <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc. </i>(2001),
    159 C.C.C. (3d) 321.  As well, this court must consider <i>Mooring v. Canada</i> <i>(National
    Parole Board)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 75, which concluded that the National
    Parole Board is not a court of competent jurisdiction.  However, <i>Mooring</i> considered
    s. 24(2) <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction issues, which deals with the exclusion
    of evidence.  This invokes very different considerations in light of the
    Board’s mandate. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Mills </i>provided
    a three-tiered test for determining s. 24(1) jurisdiction.  The court held
    that a tribunal must have jurisdiction over (1) the person; (2) the subject
    matter of the proceeding; and (3) the remedy sought.  The ORB’s jurisdiction
    over the person is conceded by the parties to this appeal.  The main issues
    are whether the ORB has jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the
    remedy sought.  </p>
  <h2>(i)        Jurisdiction over the subject matter</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am persuaded that the ORB has jurisdiction over the subject matter, premised
    in part on the <i>amicus curiae’s </i>argument that Mr. Conway’s <i>Charter</i> allegations
    address factual matters arising from the considerations specified in s. 672.54
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Specifically, the <i>Charter</i> allegations
    concern Mr. Conway’s treatment, rehabilitation and liberty interests while
    detained at CAMH.  The Board would not have jurisdiction to the extent Mr.
    Conway’s <i>Charter </i>allegations challenge the actual medical treatment
    prescribed and imposed by hospital authorities.  However, in my view, the
    Board does have jurisdiction over the allegations relating to Mr. Conway’s
    conditions of detention, including conditions regarding treatment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent it is necessary to do so, I also reject the arguments of CAMH
    and the ORB invoking <i>Nova Scotia (Workers’
    Compensation Board) v. Martin</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504, including their argument that
    the ORB’s jurisdiction does not extend to making findings of law.  Even if
    the ORB’s s. 24(1) <i>Charter </i>jurisdiction depends upon its jurisdiction
    to decide questions of law, in my view, Parliament’s intention to provide
    this jurisdiction is implicit in at least three ways.  First, Review Boards
    have the jurisdiction to interpret the language of their home statute.  Second,
    s. 672.4(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that the Review Board’s
    chairperson must be “<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>a judge of the Federal Court or of a superior, district
    or county court of a province, or a person who is qualified for appointment
    to, or has retired from, such a judicial office</span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>.</span>”  It
    would not be necessary to have such a chairperson unless questions of law
    formed part of the Board’s mandate.  Third, Parliament’s intention that the
    ORB make findings of law can be inferred from s. 672.72(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, which provides for a statutory right of appeal to a court of appeal
    from a Review Board decision.  A party may appeal on “any ground of appeal
    that raises a question of law … or of mixed law and fact.”
    Parliament would not have provided for an appeal on a question of law if
    such questions were not within the ORB’s mandate.</p>

    discern whether a particular tribunal has the power to grant the remedy sought,
    McLachlin C.J.C. adopted a “functional and structural approach” at para.

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This approach answers the question of whether a
    court or tribunal has the power to issue the remedy sought by focusing on
    its <u>function and structure</u>. On this view, it is not necessary that
    the court or tribunal have the power to grant the precise remedy sought or
    even a remedy of the same &quot;type&quot;. Although these factors may weigh
    heavily in the analysis, they are not determinative. The paramount question
    remains whether the court or tribunal, by virtue of its function and structure,
    is an appropriate forum for ordering the <i>Charter</i> remedy in issue.
    If so, it can reasonably be inferred, in the absence of any contrary indication,
    that the legislature intended the court or tribunal to have this remedy at
    its disposal when confronted with <i>Charter</i> violations that arise in
    the course of its proceedings. This approach, as I shall discuss in greater
    detail, is implicit in <i>Mills</i> and affirmed in [<i>Weber v. Ontario

    addressing the function of the tribunal within its legislative scheme, McLachlin
    C.J.C. asked whether jurisdiction to order a s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> remedy
    would frustrate or enhance the tribunal’s role.  She also queried how essential
    the power to grant the remedy would be to the tribunal’s essential functioning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a preliminary matter, it is my view that the nature of the remedy sought
    should not be construed in an unduly narrow manner.  It would be overly restrictive
    to conclude that a tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider a <i>Charter</i> application
    where the specific remedy requested is not essential for the functioning
    of the tribunal, but where a related remedy does meet this requirement.  In
    this case, it is open to this court to consider whether the Review Board,
    in keeping with its function, may grant an absolute discharge or<i> </i>may
    order conditions<i> </i>or may make such other orders that are appropriate
    to remedy a breach of the patient's<i> Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ORB’s purpose is clearly delineated in s. 672.54 of the<i> Criminal Code</i>,
    which provides that a Review Board must consider “the <span lang=EN-US>need
    to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the
    [NCR patient], the reintegration of the [patient] into society and the other
    needs of the [patient]”.  As described in </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Winko, </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>if a Review Board determines that the patient represents a threat
    to public safety, and therefore an absolute discharge is not available, the
    Board must impose a disposition, with conditions, that is the least onerous
    and restrictive.   </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      672.54 requires the Board to balance the interests of society to be protected
      from a dangerous patient against the patient’s liberty interests, while
      promoting the goal of reintegrating a rehabilitated patient into the community.  The
      Board must exercise discretion to achieve a level of safety for society
      and to promote recovery for the patient.  This complex balancing requirement
      is akin to the balancing of interests required under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    the power to grant a <i>Charter</i> remedy could enhance a Review Board’s
    role by giving it the tools essential to exercise its supervisory mandate
    regarding medical treatment and the imposition of the least onerous conditions
    of detention.</p>

    C.J.C., in <i>974649</i>, also instructed courts to examine the function
    of the tribunal in the broader legal system and to inquire whether the tribunal
    is the appropriate forum to redress a <i>Charter </i>violation.  In my view,
    the Review Board’s function is an extremely important component of the broader
    legal system, particularly in light of its responsibilities to protect society
    and to provide care for individuals who are ill.  The Review Board balances
    the safety of society against the liberty of the patient in circumstances
    where the risk posed by the patient cannot be addressed by the civil mental
    health system.  The ORB is ideally situated to perform this task.  It brings
    considerable expertise to its mandate by reason of its statutory composition
    of mental health professionals, experts in the law and representatives of
    the public.  The strength of this combined expertise provides an exceptionally
    qualified perspective for a determination of whether a patient’s <i>Charter</i> rights
    have been breached in a detention setting.  Indeed, the Review Board is perhaps
    best situated to make the factual findings that are essential to such an
    inquiry and to place them in an informed context.  If a Review Board exercises
    s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction, its reasons would provide the factual
    basis necessary to ground the legal <i>Charter</i> question.  In addition,
    the legal decision and the appropriate remedy would be subject to review
    by an appellate court on a standard of correctness.  Any legal error by the
    Board would be corrected on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McLachlin
    C.J.C. also observed at para. 82 of <i>974649 </i>that courts “should not
    interpret the will of the legislature in such a way that it results in the
    effective denial of <i>Charter</i>-mandated relief, in the absence of an
    unequivocal indication to this effect”:  see also <i>Martin, </i>at para.
    29.  While Armstrong J.A.’s reasons do not address the issue of an alternative
    forum for s. 24(1) <i>Charter </i>challenges, the <i>amicus curiae </i>and
    the Attorney General suggest the Superior Court would be the appropriate
    forum.  The ORB argues that either the Superior Court at first instance,
    or this court on appeal, has s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in my view, a NCR patient should not be compelled to make a separate <i>Charter</i> application
    to a Superior Court when the application could be dealt with at a review
    hearing.  A separate application makes little sense where the <i>Charter</i> issue
    directly relates to the patient’s terms of detention.  It would only add
    an additional and unnecessary hurdle for a person already challenged by mental
    illness.  The reality is that few patients will possess the persistence exhibited
    by Mr. Conway to pursue <i>Charter</i> breaches into a separate forum.  To
    bifurcate the proceedings as suggested could effectively render a <i>Charter</i> remedy
    illusory for all but a few tenacious NCR patients.  It would also result
    in a multiplicity of proceedings with added expense and delay, both financial
    and emotional.  In my view, this is a strong reason to conclude that the
    ORB is the most logical and convenient forum.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span

    my view, the structure of review hearings is consistent with the consideration
    of s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> remedies.  In <i>974549</i>, McLachlin C.J.C.
    recommended consideration of the following factors at para. 45:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>whether the proceedings are judicial or quasi-judicial;
    the role of counsel; the applicability or otherwise of traditional rules
    of proof and evidence; whether the court or tribunal can issue subpoenas;
    whether evidence is offered under oath; the expertise and training of the
    decision-maker; and the institutional experience of the court or tribunal
    with the remedy in question: see <i>Mooring</i> [cite omitted]. Other relevant
    considerations may include the workload of the court or tribunal, the time
    constraints it operates under, its ability to compile an adequate record
    for a reviewing court, and other such operational factors. The question,
    in essence, is whether the legislature or Parliament has furnished the court
    or tribunal with the tools necessary to fashion the remedy sought under s.
    24 in a just, fair and consistent manner without impeding its ability to
    perform its intended function.  </p>

    hearings are usually conducted on an adjudicative model.  Although a Review
    Board’s role is often described as inquisitorial, counsel call witnesses
    who are examined and cross-examined in the same manner as in a court proceeding
    (s. 672.5(11) of the <i>Code, Winko </i>at paras. 54-55).  The Review Board
    receives submissions, makes factual determinations and applies the law to
    its findings of fact to arrive at an appropriate disposition (s. 672.5(11)
    of the <i>Code</i>, Rules 16-21, <i>Rules of Procedure</i> for the Ontario

    these factors operate to support the conclusion that the Review Board’s structure,

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    factors demonstrate that the operations of the ORB are manifestly different
    in nature and kind from those of the National Parole Board considered in <i>Mooring</i> and
    relied upon by Armstrong J.A.  As noted by Sopinka J. in <i>Mooring</i>,
    at para. 26, the only function of a Parole Board post-suspension hearing
    is to determine the risk to society of a continued conditional release.  Counsel
    at such a parole hearing play a very limited role.  Only at the end of the
    hearing may counsel address the Parole Board on behalf of the client (para.
    25).  Parole Boards do not have the power to issues subpoenas and the presiding
    panel may have no legal training (para. 25).  Furthermore, <i>Mooring</i> involved
    a s. 24(2) question about the Parole Board’s jurisdiction to exclude relevant
    evidence obtained through a <i>Charter</i> breach.  The present case under
    appeal does not raise a s. 24(2) issue.  Accordingly, I do not read <i>Mooring</i> as
    determinative of whether a Review Board can exercise s. 24(1) jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded otherwise by the considerations raised by Armstrong J.A.,
    specifically:  the requirement on the ORB to conduct annual hearings; the
    Board’s resources to take on <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction, and Armstrong J.A.’s
    conclusion that a great deal of time was spent at Mr. Conway’s eight-day
    hearing on the <i>Charter </i>application. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the statement in the ORB’s factum that six days out of the Board’s
    eight-day hearing were devoted to <i>Charter</i> issues does not survive
    scrutiny.  <span
style='color:black;'>Witnesses were called, examined, and cross-examined throughout
    the hearing.  While some questions concerning <i>Charter</i> issues were
    embedded in the examinations, there was no 'separate' <i>Charter</i> hearing.  All
    issues were dealt with together, as they should be.  In reality, it appears
    that the extraordinary length of the hearing was caused by Mr. Conway’s extremely
    troublesome behaviour, resulting in prolonged recesses followed by more intransigent
    and unacceptably disruptive conduct.  This behaviour was described in the
    ORB’s reasons and appears to be unrelated to the <i>Charter </i>issues. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a practical matter, how would this jurisdiction affect the Board?  We were
    not referred to any evidence to support the position that limited s. 24(1) <i>Charter </i>jurisdiction
    would disproportionately impede the Board’s efficiency.  In any event, the
    Review Board would only consider s. 24(1) applications relevant to its review
    mandate.  It would begin by asking itself whether it has jurisdiction over
    the remedy sought.  At para. 26 of <i>974649</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    held that any remedial power exercised by the court of competent jurisdiction
    must be derived explicitly or implicitly form “its enabling legislation”.  If
    the Review Board finds jurisdiction, the evidence relevant to the <i>Charter</i> application
    would likely not significantly differ from the evidence relevant to the merits.  The
    only apparent expansion of the Review Board’s workload would be the receipt
    of submissions on the <i>Charter</i> issue and the completion of additional
    reasons to reflect its decision.  In my view, the additional burden on the
    Board is not disproportionate, particularly when contrasted with the burden
    inherent in requiring a detained patient to commence and prosecute a separate
    application before a Superior Court.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I do not agree with Armstrong J.A.’s implicit conclusion that the ORB is
    not a
    “court of competent jurisdiction” within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  To
    the contrary, in my view, the function and structure of the Board indicates
    that Parliament intended it to deal with s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> issues that
    it is suited to resolve in review hearings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have already indicated that, for obvious reasons, it is not appropriate for
    the Board to resolve Mr. Conway’s alleged <i>Charter</i> breaches by granting
    an absolute discharge to an individual who is clearly dangerous.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>How
    then would a <i>Charter </i>remedy operate in the circumstances of this case?  <i>Amicus </i>puts
    forward four alleged breaches.  One is apparently frivolous, in that Mr.
    Conway complains that the staff demand that he use the word
    “please”.  On its face, the hospital’s requirement for ordinary civility
    could not amount to a <i>Charter</i> breach.  This claim would be summarily
    disposed of by the Board. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the other three alleged breaches, if proven, raise serious issues.  Mr. Conway
    alleges the use of arbitrary seclusion measures upon his transfer to CAMH,
    confinement for a period longer than seven days without the Board being notified
    contrary to s. 672.56(2)(b) of the <i>Code</i>, and a failure by the hospital
    to provide adequate advocacy and treatment resources. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the Board is in the best position to determine the merits of these
    three allegations.  If the Board concludes that the allegations have merit,
    and that Mr. Conway was detained in circumstances that were arbitrary or
    contrary to the hospital’s mandate, the Board is in the best position to
    determine the appropriate remedy, which would presumably be reflected in
    delineating conditions for Mr. Conway’s continued detention.  For example,
    the Board could require the hospital to provide opportunities during Mr.
    Conway’s continued detention for access to both treatment and advocacy.  As
    part of its mandate to order <span
lang=EN-US>the least onerous and restrictive</span> detention, the Board could
    also specify conditions to provide guidance surrounding Mr. Conway’s future
    seclusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is difficult to predict the parameters of constitutional applications that
    the Review Board may receive in the future, or the range of remedies that
    it may appropriately grant under s. 24(1).  In my view, the precise parameters
    of the Board’s <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction are best left to be determined
    on the basis of the individual circumstances of the case presented. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    conclude, the function and structure of the Board suggests that it can provide
    an expeditious determination concerning any <i>Charter</i> breaches relating
    to Mr. Conway’s detention and treatment.  With the advantage of the Board’s
    perspective on the merits of the allegations and the appropriate remedy,
    this court would then be in a position to review the correctness of the Board’s <i>Charter </i>analysis
    and the remedy granted by the Board.  In my view, requiring the patient to
    bring these challenges by way of a separate application to the Superior Court
    would effectively deny his <i>Charter</i> remedies.  For these reasons, I
    would refer the questions of the alleged <i>Charter</i> breaches back to
    the Board for determination on their merits. </p>
