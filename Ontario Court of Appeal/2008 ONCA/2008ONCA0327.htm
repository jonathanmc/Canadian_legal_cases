  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Darrell Wronko, pursued a wrongful dismissal claim against his
    employer of seventeen years, the respondent, Western Inventory Service Ltd.  In
    Wronko’s last four years at Western, he served as Vice-President of National
    Accounts and Marketing.  After assuming this position, Wronko signed an employment
    contract dated December 2000.  His contract included a termination provision
    that provided for the payment of two years salary in the event he was terminated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    September 2002, Western’s new president, Sean Davoren, sent to Wronko a different
    contract, which would reduce his entitlement on termination from two years
    to thirty weeks pay.  Wronko refused to sign the new contract.  Western took
    the position that the termination provision in the new contract would come
    into effect in two years time.  Wronko continued to object to the amended
    termination provision over the ensuing two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko’s
    employment with Western ended in September 2004 after Western wrote to Wronko
    advising him that the amended termination provision was now in effect.  Wronko
    replied that he understood his employment to be terminated and did not report
    to work.  He sued for wrongful dismissal and claimed damages for breach of
    contract, as well as damages for bad faith, punitive and exemplary damages,
    and damages for unpaid vacation pay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issues at trial were whether Western had the right to unilaterally
    amend the termination provision in Wronko’s employment contract; whether
    the end of Wronko’s employment constituted a resignation, a constructive
    dismissal, or a termination; and what, if any, Western’s notice obligations
    were as of September 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that Western was entitled to unilaterally amend the
    contract and that Wronko had ended the employment relationship when he refused
    to continue to work.  He held that the employer had no further obligations
    to Wronko after he ended the relationship.  The trial judge thus dismissed
    most of Wronko’s claims, except for his claim relating to unpaid vacation
    pay in the amount of $6,977. Based on Wronko’s partial success at trial,
    the trial judge awarded him costs in the amount of $10,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko
    appeals from the order dismissing most of his claims, while Western seeks
    leave to cross-appeal from the costs disposition. For the reasons that follow,
    I would allow the appeal on the merits and dismiss the cross-appeal.  </p>
  <h4>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko
    began working for Western in April 1987.  It was his first job after graduating
    from university.  He worked continuously for the company for some seventeen
    years, progressing through the ranks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    February 2000, Wronko was promoted to the position of Vice-President of National
    Accounts and Marketing.  Following this promotion, he signed a written employment
    contract with the company, dated December 20, 2000, which was negotiated
    on Western’s behalf by its then-president, Nicholas Ford.  The contract provided
    for an annual salary of $143,000 including car allowance.  It also included
    a termination provision that provided for payment of “the previous two (2)
    years salary plus bonus to be paid as termination if notice of termination
    is given... at any fiscal year end or at any other time”.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    June 2002, Western’s new president, Sean Davoren, delivered an employment
    contract to Wronko by inter-office mail with an attached note in the form
    of a “yellow sticky” asking him to, “Please initial, sign and return original
    to me as soon as possible.”  Mr. Davoren testified that he was unaware of
    the December 2000 contract at this time.    The key difference in the attached
    contract was that it reduced Wronko’s entitlement to notice of termination
    from two years to three weeks notice or pay in lieu of notice for each year
    of employment, to a maximum of thirty weeks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko
    did not execute this contract but instead pointed out the error in the termination
    provision of the new contract, which would eliminate his entitlement to two
    years termination pay and reduce it to a maximum of thirty weeks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    a subsequent meeting between Wronko and Davoren in August 2002, Davoren told
    Wronko that the prior contractual provision for two years notice was a “mistake”.
    However, there is no evidence that Davoren was a participant in the contract
    negotiations between Wronko and the former president of Western, nor is there
    any evidence that anyone from Western had previously indicated to Wronko
    that the two year termination provision was a mistake.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also
    at the August 2002 meeting, Wronko was asked to sign a document confirming
    that he agreed to the reduced termination provision of a maximum of thirty
    weeks on termination.  The document suggested that he seek legal advice before
    signing it.  It further specified that Wronko’s agreement to the change in
    the termination provision from two years to a maximum of thirty weeks notice
    was “…done voluntarily and is not a mandatory requirement for your continued
    employment.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    surprisingly, the legal advice Wronko received following the August 2002
    meeting was that he should not sign the document.
     Wronko wrote to Davoren in September 2002 by e-mail stating his position
    regarding the proposed “significant reduction in my severance package…” and
    explaining why he could not sign.  Wronko’s message concluded with the statement:
    “If the Company has a reasonable alternative it wishes to put forward, I
    am prepared to give it due consideration.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko
    did not receive a proposal from Davoren regarding a reasonable alternative.  Instead,
    Davoren wrote a memo to Wronko on September 9, 2002 in which he purported
    to give him 104 weeks (<i>i.e.</i> two years) notice that the termination
    provision in his employment contract would be changed to provide that upon
    termination of his employment, other than for cause, Wronko would be entitled
    to three weeks notice or pay in lieu thereof for each year of employment,
    to a maximum of thirty weeks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 3, 2003, Wronko met with Davoren to deal with general management matters
    and was confronted with allegations by Davoren that he was not loyal to the
    company and that he had personal conflicts of interest due to his relationship
    with the previous president, who was now working for a competitor. These
    allegations were made in response to a query by Wronko as to whether he could
    purchase shares in the company – an offer presented to the other senior managers
    at Western.  Davoren denied Wronko this opportunity because of his perceived
    disloyalty. The trial judge found that there was no evidentiary basis to
    support Davoren’s mistrust of Wronko.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 21, 2003, Wronko wrote to Davoren reiterating his opposition to the
    proposed change to the termination provision of his contract. Davoren did
    not respond to this letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    another meeting between the two in October 2003, Wronko once again raised
    the question of his continuing employment with the company. Davoren made
    it clear to Wronko that he was not interested in negotiating terms under
    which Wronko might leave.  Davoren accused Wronko of having a “sweetheart
    deal” with the old president of Western.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 13, 2004 – two years and four days after the September 9, 2002
    memo was sent to Wronko – Davoren sent Wronko an e-mail attaching the 2002
    memo and a contract, which was described as the “go forward agreement”.  The
    attached contract contained the termination provision set out in the 2002
    memo.  The e-mail expressed Davoren’s view that since two years had passed,
    the new employment contract was now in effect. He asked Wronko to sign the
    agreement and return it.  Significantly, Davoren wrote: “If you do not wish
    to accept the new terms and conditions of employment as outlined, then we
    do not have a job for you.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that Wronko had consistently refused to accept a new contract throughout
    the last two years, he – unsurprisingly – replied the next day that he understood
    his employment to be terminated.  He did not report to work the next day,
    but offered to come in to assist with the transition. Davoren e-mailed back,
    stating that he was not terminated.  He further wrote:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please be advised that effective
    <st1:date Year="2004" Day="8" Month="9" w:st="on">
    September 8, 2004, your 104 weeks notice is complete. In the absence of your
    signature on the new employment agreement (which remains entirely optional
    and voluntary) your existing employment agreement remains in place with the
    amended termination provisions as amended by the company on September 9,
  2004 after giving you 104 weeks notice of their impending change.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wronko
    replied in a final e-mail that he considered the September 13, 2004 message
    to be a termination and requested his severance package of two years pay.</p>
  <h3>Reasons of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    trial judge identified the real issue as being whether Western had the unilateral
    right to vary the termination provision in the employment contract upon reasonable
    notice to the employee.  In deciding this issue in the affirmative, he relied
    on the reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Farber v. Royal Trust
    Co</i>., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 846 at para. 34, where
    in the context of a constructive dismissal claim, Gonthier J. quoted an article
    stating: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A constructive dismissal occurs
      when an employer makes a unilateral and fundamental change to a term or
      condition of an employment contract without providing reasonable notice
      of that change to the employee. Such action amounts to a repudiation of
      the contract of employment by the employer whether or not he intended to
      continue the employment relationship. Therefore, the employee can treat
      the contract as wrongfully terminated and resign which, in turn, gives
      rise to an obligation on the employer's part to provide damages in lieu
      of reasonable notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was not disputed at trial or on appeal that Western’s proposed amendment
    to the termination provision in Wronko’s employment contract constituted
    a fundamental change to the terms of the contract.  The trial judge concluded
    that although the employer had the right to impose a fundamental change to
    the contract, it was required to give reasonable notice of the change to
    Wronko.  The trial judge found that Western had met this requirement by providing
    two years notice on September 9, 2002.  Although the trial judge accepted
    that Wronko had no intention of resigning and he believed that he was dismissed
    unilaterally, the trial judge concluded, based on <i>Farber</i>, that it
    was Wronko who had ended the employment relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the trial judge dismissed the claims for damages other than for
    $6,977 in unpaid vacation pay.  Based on the plaintiff’s partial success,
    he ordered costs payable to Wronko in the amount of $10,000.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    basic premise underlying the individual contract of employment is that it
    continues as long as both parties agree.  In common parlance, the employment
    of persons is “at will”; that is, either party has a right to terminate the
    employment relationship without cause.  However, the use of the expressions “at
    will” and “a right to terminate” must not obscure the reality that the employer’s
    right to terminate an employee without cause is a breach of contract that
    carries with it consequences for the employer, both under statute and at
    common law.  The use of these expressions also must not obscure the reality
    that an employer’s unilateral change to a fundamental term of an employment
    contract constitutes a repudiation of the contract.  An act of repudiation
    carries consequences, which depend on how the employee responds to the repudiation.  </p>

    case must be viewed within the context of these general principles.  There
    are two key issues to be determined. The first is whether the September 13,
    2004 letter sent by the president of Western constituted a termination of
    the employment relationship by the employer.  If so, the second question
    is what, if any, consequences flow from this termination.</p>
  <h4>1.         Was Wronko terminated by Western on September
      13, 2004?</h4>

    my opinion, the facts of this case do not support the trial judge’s conclusion
    that Wronko ended the employment relationship.  The employer’s clear intention
    to terminate Wronko was expressed in Davoren’s e-mail of September 13, 2004.  In
    substance, that e-mail was an ultimatum by Western.  Wronko was told that
    if he did not accept the change to his employment contract, “then we do not
    have a job for you”.  In light of Davoren’s, and by extension Western’s,
    knowledge of Wronko’s steadfast opposition to the amendment to his contract,
    a reasonable person would regard the concluding statement in Davoren’s e-mail
    as a termination.  </p>

    for this conclusion is found in the trial judge’s finding that “it is clear
    from the evidence that the Plaintiff did not intend to resign” (at para.
    31).  The trial judge also found that it was reasonable for Wronko to infer
    from the message of September 13, 2004 that if he did not accept the new
    terms,  “the phrase ‘then we do not have a job for you’ was effectively notice
    of termination” (at para. 32).  In light of these factual findings, the trial
    judge erred in holding that Wronko ended the employment relationship.  In
    my view, Western terminated Wronko’s employment.</p>

    trial judge accepted Western’s position that an employer has a right to make
    a unilateral and fundamental change to a term of an employment contract upon
    providing reasonable notice of that change to the employee.  He further accepted
    Western’s submission that the September 2002 memo sent to Wronko advising
    him that the termination provision in his contract would be amended in two
    years time constituted reasonable notice.  On this view, the unilateral change
    to the provision was properly effected as of September 2004 and the employee
    was bound to accept the change without further consequences to the employer.</p>

      coming to this view, the trial judge relied on the passage quoted above
      from <i>Farber</i>, repeated here for ease of reference:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A constructive dismissal occurs
      when an employer makes a unilateral and fundamental change to a term or
      condition of an employment contract without providing reasonable notice
      of that change to the employee. Such action amounts to a repudiation of
      the contract of employment by the employer whether or not he intended to
      continue the employment relationship. Therefore, the employee can treat
      the contract as wrongfully terminated and resign which, in turn, gives
      rise to an obligation on the employer's part to provide damages in lieu
      of reasonable notice.       </p>

      Supreme Court in <i>Farber</i> was faced with a situation where the plaintiff,
      a senior manager, was given one month notice by his employer that he had
      to accept a demotion or resign.  The plaintiff refused to report to this
      new position and sued for constructive dismissal.  The <i>Farber</i> decision
      must be interpreted in light of these facts.  The Supreme Court in that
      case was not purporting to outline the rights and obligations of the parties
      in circumstances where an employee registers an unequivocal rejection of
      an intended fundamental change to the terms of his employment and where
      the employer permits him to continue to work according to the existing
      terms without giving notice that refusal to accept the new terms will result
      in termination.  Those are the circumstances in the present case.  </p>

    reasons of Mackay J.A. of this court in <i>Hill v. Peter Gorman Ltd.</i> (1957),
    9 D.L.R. (2d) 124, speak precisely to this situation.  In <i>Hill</i>,<i> </i>the
    court dealt with the case of a commission salesman employed pursuant to an
    indefinite term contract, terminable on two weeks notice, that tied his remuneration
    to a commission based on net sales.  The employer was concerned with delinquent
    accounts and on notice to the salesman it began to withhold ten per cent
    of his commissions in a reserve fund for bad debts. The salesman complained
    periodically about this arrangement, but remained in the employ of the company
    for over a year after the practice was initiated. Following the employee’s
    resignation from the company, he brought an action to recover the withheld
    commissions. The trial judge found as a fact that the salesman had never
    agreed to the variation and ordered the commissions to be paid at the originally
    agreed rate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    appeal, Mackay J.A. held that mere continuance by an employee in employment
    does not amount in law to an acceptance by an employee of a unilateral variation
    of his contract by his employer.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>  The employee is entitled to insist on the employer’s
    adherence to the terms of the contract. The employer could have terminated
    the employee’s contract and offered him employment on the new terms, but
    it did not do so. This was fatal to its position.  Mackay J.A. stated at
    132:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where an employer attempts
      to vary the contractual terms, the position of the employee is this: He
      may accept the variation expressly or impliedly in which case there is
      a new contract. He may refuse to accept it and if the employer persists
      in the attempted variation the employee may treat this persistence as a
      breach of contract and sue the employer for damages, or while refusing
      to accept it he may continue in his employment and if the employer permits
      him to discharge his obligations and the employee makes it plain that he
      is not accepting the variation, then the employee is entitled to insist
      on the original terms.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>If the plaintiff
        made it clear…that he did not agree to the change…the proper course for
        [the employer] to pursue was to terminate the contract by proper notice
        and to offer employment on the new terms. Until it was so terminated,
        the plaintiff was entitled to insist on performance of the original contract</i>.  [Emphasis
        added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      the cited passage, Mackay J.A. identifies three options that are
      available to an employee when an employer attempts a unilateral amendment
      to a fundamental term of a contract of employment.  <span> </span>They may be summarized as follows.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the employee may accept the change in the terms of employment, either expressly
    or implicitly through apparent acquiescence, in which case the employment
    will continue under the altered terms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the employee may reject the change and sue for damages if the employer persists
    in treating the relationship as subject to the varied term.  This course
    of action would now be termed a “constructive dismissal”, as discussed in <i>Farber</i>,
    although this term was not in use when <i>Hill</i> was decided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third,
    the employee may make it clear to the employer that he or she is rejecting
    the new term.  The employer may respond to this rejection by terminating
    the employee with proper notice and offering re-employment on the new terms.  If
    the employer does not take this course and permits the employee to continue
    to fulfill his or her job requirements, then the employee is entitled to
    insist on adherence to the terms of the original contract.  In other words,
    if the employer permits the employee to discharge his obligations under the
    original employment contract, then – unless proper notice of termination
    is given – the employer is regarded as acquiescing to the employee’s position.  As
    Mackay J.A. so aptly put it: “I cannot agree that an employer has any unilateral right to change
    a contract or that by attempting to make such a change he can force an employee
    to either accept it or quit.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On
    the facts of the present case, the trial judge erred in treating this case
    as though the employee had chosen to pursue the second option, an action
    for constructive dismissal as discussed by the Supreme Court in <i>Farber</i>.   This
    error is understandable.  In many cases, where an employer imposes a unilateral
    change of a fundamental term of an employment contract, the employee’s response
    will be to sue for constructive dismissal because the change will have an
    immediate and undesired impact on the employee.  For example, a unilateral
    change may represent an immediate demotion of the employee, or it may amount
    to a significant reduction in salary or hours of work.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the present case, the unilateral change did not have an immediate impact
    on the employee.  Wronko’s response to the attempted change and Western’s
    reaction to his response bring this case outside the constructive dismissal
    context and squarely into the third situation identified by Mackay J.A. in <i>Hill.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    gave notice in September 2002 of its intention to amend the termination provision
    of Wronko’s employment contract effective September 2004.  This notice constituted
    a repudiation of the contract.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>  In response, Wronko gave clear, unequivocal and
    repeated notice from September 2002 until September 2004 that he refused
    to accept the new termination provision.  In other words, he did not choose
    to accept the employer’s repudiation of the contract and sue for damages,
    as would be the case in a constructive dismissal situation.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>  Despite Wronko’s refusal to agree to the new
    termination provision, Western permitted him to continue in his employment
    according to the existing terms of his contract.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New \(W1\)"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    been made aware of Wronko’s opposition to the new contract in September 2002
    and his continued opposition thereafter, Western had two choices:  it could
    advise Wronko that his refusal to accept the new contract would result in
    his termination and that re-employment would be offered on the new terms.  If
    Western were to take this position, the termination provision in the December
    2000 contract would be triggered.  Alternatively, Western could accept that
    there would be no new agreement and that Wronko’s employment would continue
    on the existing terms.  Having failed to choose the former course, Western
    must be taken to have acquiesced to Wronko’s position and to have accepted
    that the terms of the existing contract remained in effect.  Western’s decision
    to terminate Wronko in September 2004 thus carried with it the consequence
    that Wronko was entitled to two years termination pay pursuant to the terms
    of his existing employment contract.</p>

    result, in my view, is in accordance with the views expressed by employment
    law scholars.  Ellen Mole in <i>Wrongful Dismissal Practice Manual, </i>vol.
    1, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., looseleaf (Markham, ON: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2006)
    at 3-1 states that: “Once a contract of employment has been formed, neither
    party has the right to unilaterally change a significant term of the contract,
    unless both parties agree to the change.”  She goes on to cite the passage
    referred to above from <i>Hill v. Gorman</i> identifying the three options
    that are available to an employee when an employer attempts to unilaterally
    alter the employment contract.  </p>

    the authors of <i>Employment Law in Canada</i>, vol. 2, 4<sup>th</sup> ed.,
    looseleaf (Markham, ON: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2005) note at 13-16 that
    management “can only make lawful unilateral changes if it precedes them by
    serving due notice of termination”, in which case “it could be said that
    the employer has given proper notice that employment is to end but has coupled
    it with an offer of re-engagement on the changed items, which the employee
    can accept by continuing to work under the new terms.”<a href="#_ftn5"

    did not provide Wronko with notice that it intended to treat his objection

    Wronko in September 2004 constituted a wrongful dismissal that triggered

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…the defendant virtually finessed the departure
    of the plaintiff from its ranks after making unfounded and unfair allegations
    about the manner in which the plaintiff obtained his contract of employment.
    The defendant continued its hardball tactics by dispatching its president
    to the trial to challenge the vacation pay that had previously been calculated
    by the defendant’s personnel.  In my opinion, that conduct has no role in
    the relationship between employer and employee, particularly as it pertains
    to the emotionally charged area of severance.</p>

      that result from dismissal.” These legal protections are of little value
      to an employee who seeks to assert his rights in court, but is faced with
      an employer who engages in “hardball tactics” in the course of litigation.
      To ensure that employees have access to the justice system, the courts
      must renounce an employer’s use of such tactics. One way to do this is
      through costs sanctions.</p>

    look elsewhere for employment” (at para. 8).  After the employee chose to
    leave her employment, the case should have been decided on a traditional
    constructive dismissal analysis.  I note that this decision has been criticized
    by academic commentators for modifying general principles of contract law:  see
    G. England, R. Wood and I. Christie, <i>Employment Law in Canada</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    13-22 to 13-23.  </p>

      the total income you earned, not including employment insurance, for the
      two-year period roughly following the termination of your employment, was
      $129,125 plus $88,667?” He agreed that these figures were correct. However,
      it appears from his earlier testimony and his income tax return that his
      actual income in 2005 was $129,538, for a total of $218,205.</p>
