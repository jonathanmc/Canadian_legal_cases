  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise a number of issues respecting the trial judge’s charge to
    the jury in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first is that the trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury of the risk
    to accurate identification from the fact that the investigating officer may
    have shown photographs of the appellants to the key identification witness,
    Mr. Pitre, before taking his statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there may be legitimate concerns in this case regarding the process used
    by the officer of showing photographs to Mr. Pitre while taking his initial
    statement, this issue was not raised by defence counsel in their jury addresses
    at trial. It is significant in evaluating the seriousness of the concern
    in this case, that the witness Mr. Pitre knew the appellants and testified
    that he recognized them on the night of the assault. This was therefore a
    recognition case and not a case where the witness had to identify a stranger
    by description. In any event, the trial judge identified the issue and highlighted
    the evidence to the jury in the context of his charge on identification.
    Finally, defence counsel made no objection to the charge on this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant Philion argued that the trial judge erred by failing to give
    a warning regarding the unreliability of in-dock identification. Again, as
    this was principally a recognition case on the part of Mr. Pitre, the in-dock
    identification component played a limited role. In respect to the witness
    Mr. Duré, the trial judge did explain the limited value of his identification
    of the appellants in-dock after being shown their photographs. We are satisfied
    that the trial judge’s instructions were wholly adequate to bring home to
    the jury the frailties of the witness’s ability to identify the appellants
    after having been through the investigation and preliminary inquiry procedures. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant Philion argued that the trial judge should have given a <i>Chartier </i>warning
    because Mr. Pitre described Mr. Philion as having a tattoo when he did not
    have one at the trial. In our view, a <i>Chartier</i> warning was not warranted
    in this case. First, Mr. Pitre was not the only witness who identified Mr.
    Philion. Second, as Mr. Pitre recognized Mr. Philion at the assault, his
    misdescription was a factor for the jury to consider in weighing the identification
    evidence but did not rise to the level of a <i>Chartier</i> misdescription
    issue. Again, in any event, the trial judge highlighted the tattoo discrepancies
    in Mr. Pitre’s evidence in detail in his jury charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant Mathieu Lafleur argues that the trial judge erred in not providing
    the jury with a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning with respect to Mr. Pitre because
    of the many inconsistencies in his evidence. Again, a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    was not requested by defence counsel. Also the trial judge spent six pages
    in his charge outlining the frailties in Mr.&nbsp;Pitre’s evidence and brought
    home to the jury the concerns about the witness’s reliability and credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the appellant Guy Lafleur argued that the trial judge erred by mentioning
    on two occasions that he had gone to school with Mr. Pitre. While this was
    a factual error, subsequently, the trial judge made it clear that Mr. Pitre
    had only met Guy Lafleur either once or three times. We are satisfied that
    it was clear to the jury that Mr. Pitre had only limited previous contact
    with Guy Lafleur. We note that there was no objection to the charge on this
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth,
    each of the appellants argues that the verdicts were unreasonable. We do
    not accept these arguments. There was direct evidence of eye-witness identification
    by Mr.&nbsp;Pitre who knew the appellants. Moreover, none of them testified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, it is our view that the trial judge gave a well-crafted and balanced
    charge that highlighted to the jury the issues for them to decide, the main
    one being identification and the frailties of the evidence on that issue.
    We would therefore not give effect to any of the grounds of appeal raised
    and would dismiss the appeals on conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Guy Lafleur also appeals his sentence of three years in prison.
    We see no error in principle in the sentence that was imposed. He was not
    a first offender, but has a significant record, including three convictions
    for assault. We believe that the sentence imposed is within the range. We
    would therefore grant leave to appeal sentence, but dismiss the appeal.</p>
