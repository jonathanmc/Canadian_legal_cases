    appellant was released on restrictive bail which he served for eighteen months.
    He then pled guilty to the offence. After serving fifteen weeks and one day

    Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in law by failing to comply with
    s.&nbsp;24.1(2) of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, which is made applicable
    by Order-in-Council 498/2004, in accordance with s. 88 of the <i>Youth Criminal
    Justice Act</i>. Sections 24.1(2) and (4) provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>24.1(2) Subject
    to subsection (3), where the youth court commits a young person to custody
    under paragraph 20(1)(k) or (k.1) or makes an order under subsection 26.1(1)
    or paragraph 26.6(2)(b), it shall specify in the order whether the custody
    is to be open custody or secure custody.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(4)  In deciding
    whether a young person shall be placed in open custody or secure custody,
    the youth court or the provincial director shall take into account the following
    factors:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     that a young
    person should be placed in a level of custody involving      the least degree
    of containment and restraint, having regard to</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (i)  the
    seriousness of the offence in respect of which the young person was committed
    to custody and the circumstances in which that offence was committed,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (ii)  the
    needs and circumstances of the young person, including proximity
    to family, school, employment and support services,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (iii)
    the safety of other young persons in custody, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (iv)
    the interests of society;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      that
    the level of custody should allow for the best possible match of programs
    to the young person’s needs and behaviour, having regard to
    the findings of any assessment in respect of the young person;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      the
    likelihood of escape if the young person is placed in open custody;

    trial judge imposed twelve months of closed custody without considering whether
    any part of the custody portion of the sentence should be served in open
    custody. Although the trial judge was cognizant of the appellant’s need and
    desire to obtain an education while serving his sentence, he focused on the
    quality of the educational offering in the secure custody facility without
    considering whether the secure facility provided “the least degree of containment
    and restraint”, having regard to the legislated criteria in accordance with
    s. 24.1(4) or whether the sentence accords with s. 38(2)(e)(i) of the <i>YCJA</i>,
    that is “the least restrictive sentence” that is capable of achieving the
    purpose of sentencing under the Act set out in s. 38(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that when such an error is made, the court of appeal may not
    set aside the sentence and impose the appropriate sentence as it does with
    adult offenders. Rather, the Crown says the court is limited to determining
    what portion of the custodial sentence is to be served in secure custody
    and what portion in open custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this submission. We were referred to no section of the <i>YCJA</i> that
    restricts the ordinary role of a court on a sentence appeal to impose the
    appropriate sentence, based on the record and any admitted fresh evidence,
    once the sentence originally imposed has been set aside for error of law.
    In determining the appropriate sentence, the court must have regard to s.
    38(1) of the <i>YCJA</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='color:black;
font-weight:normal;'>38.</span> (1) The purpose of sentencing under section
    42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence
    through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences
    for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration
    into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a serious crime requiring a sentence that adequately reflects the twin
    principles of youth sentencing of accountability and rehabilitation. The
    record shows that since his arrest and while on bail pending his plea and
    sentencing as well as after, the appellant has effectively turned his life
    around. He has shown sincere remorse, he has excelled at his studies and
    is continuing to do so, and he has shown positive leadership characteristics
    both while serving his custodial sentence as well as while in school when
    on bail. He is also the father of a child and is acting responsibly toward
    the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, at this point in time it would not serve the purposes of sentencing
    for the appellant to be returned to a custodial setting. We would therefore
    vary the custodial portion of the sentence imposed by the trial judge to
    time served in custody of fifteen weeks and one day, followed by six months
    community supervision, followed by one-year probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also appeals the DNA order made by the trial judge. In our view,
    the reasons of the trial judge were sufficient to explain why the commission
    of this serious offence warranted a DNA order. We see no error in his conclusion.
    We would dismiss that portion of the appeal.</p>
