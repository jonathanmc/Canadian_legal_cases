    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence for possession of proceeds
    of crime and laundering proceeds of crime. We would allow the appeal and
    order a new trial because of the following error of law by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the equipment found in the two trucks was used
    for a marijuana grow-op operation and that the $192,000 found in the two
    trucks was the proceeds of the production and sale of marijuana. To find
    knowledge by the co-accused, Mr. Hoang, the trial judge relied on his admission
    to the customs officers that both the equipment and the money belonged to
    him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the issue of whether the appellant knew that the
    money was in the trucks as it was hidden in packages in various locations.
    The trial judge concluded that the appellant did have that knowledge and
    therefore was guilty of the offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge did not at any point address the issue of whether Mr.&nbsp;Nguyen
    had knowledge that the money was proceeds of crime. This was a necessary
    element of both offences. While there was evidence from which a trier of
    fact could infer knowledge by the appellant of the origin of the money in
    the trucks, whether that knowledge was proved beyond a reasonable doubt was
    an issue that had to be specifically determined by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    that basis we would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order
    a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also raised the issue of the scope of the expert evidence in this
    case. Although it is unnecessary that we address this issue in coming to
    our decision, we wish to comment briefly on it as we have ordered a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that the expert evidence in this case led by the
    Crown on the issue of proceeds of crime, laundering of such proceeds, and
    marijuana grow- operations went well beyond the appropriate bounds for the
    admission of such evidence. The witness Rodonets gave evidence of what drug
    dealers and money launderers normally say when confronted by authorities
    at the border, for example, that they won the money in a lottery. Rodonets
    then used that evidence as part of the basis for his opinion that the accused,
    having given a similar explanation, was guilty of the crimes charged. The
    trial judge relied on this evidence in his reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    opinion evidence was clearly inappropriate. Expert evidence of witnesses
    who have extensive experience in a specific area that may not be familiar
    to the court can be called on to enlighten the court regarding that experience.
    But such expert witnesses should not be permitted to go further and express
    opinions based on anecdotal reports of typical excuses advanced by persons
    stopped with money in their vehicle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
