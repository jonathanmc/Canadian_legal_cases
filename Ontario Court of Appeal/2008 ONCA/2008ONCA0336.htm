    a trial before Ewaschuk J. sitting with a jury, the appellant and his co-accused,
    Jason Bettencourt, were convicted of second-degree murder. The trial judge
    sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole
    for twelve years. The appellant appeals from his conviction and seeks leave
    to appeal the period of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    charge against the appellant relates to the murder of Omar McFarlane. The
    police found Mr. McFarlane’s body lying on a driveway in Etobicoke at around
    5:34 a.m. on September 6, 2002. Mr. McFarlane died from twelve gunshot wounds,
    eight of which were to his head and chest. He also had abrasions, cuts and
    bruises on the left side of his face; a patterned bruise on his right cheek,
    consistent with having been hit with the butt of a gun; cuts and scratches
    to the back of his neck and throat; a cut on his upper back; abrasions on
    his torso and arms; and multiple cuts and abrasions on his hands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    largely on the forensic evidence, the theory of the Crown at trial was that
    the deceased was attacked initially while sitting in the front passenger
    seat of his car, and that he suffered the knife cuts to his throat and back
    and a blow to the side of his head during this attack. He escaped from his
    car, but the appellant’s co-accused fired a number of gunshots at him. The
    deceased tried to flee on foot, but his attackers pursued him, the appellant
    in the deceased’s car and his co-accused in the car and on foot. The co-accused
    eventually caught the accused and fired the fatal gunshots. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the co-accused fled the scene in the deceased’s vehicle but
    were pursued by the police and crashed into the fence of a house bordering
    the Humber River Ravine. They jumped over the fence into the ravine. The
    police found the appellant injured in the ravine a short time later. He broke
    his leg while trying to escape. The police also found a gold necklace belonging
    to the deceased hanging on the branch of a tree near where they found the
    appellant. There was no visible blood on the necklace and police did not
    observe any blood on the north side of the river where they found the appellant.
    The police also found a yellow utility knife absent its blade near the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown claimed that the appellant aided or abetted the murder or
    that he participated in a robbery or theft knowing that the murder was a
    probable consequence. The appellant claimed that his co-accused perpetrated
    the initial attack and that he sat frozen in fear in the driver’s side of
    the deceased’s car while the co-accused hunted down the deceased on foot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds on his conviction appeal. First, he submits
    that the trial judge erred in leaving s. 21(2) of the<i> Criminal Code</i> with
    the jury because there was insufficient evidence of a predicate offence to
    support a theory of liability under that sub-section. We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s theory concerning a predicate offence was that, prior to the murder,
    the appellant and his co-accused agreed to rob the deceased of either his
    car or his gold necklace. The Crown claimed that the forensic evidence demonstrated
    that the appellant and his co-accused both participated in a violent struggle
    with the deceased in the deceased’s car, that the co-accused hit the deceased
    with a gun during this struggle, and that the appellant stole the deceased’s
    gold necklace before he was murdered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we consider that the evidence capable of supporting this theory was slim,
    in our view, it was sufficient to justify leaving s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> with the jury. This evidence included evidence of: i) injuries to
    the deceased that were inflicted with a knife and the butt of a gun; ii)
    the deceased’s blood in the front passenger seat of the car; iii) the deceased’s
    blood on the right sleeve and front panel of the appellant’s shirt and on
    his boot; iv) the co-accused’s blood in the back seat of the car; v) a bloodied
    bent knife in the back of the car; vi) the co-accused’s blood in a trail
    tracking the deceased’s movements as evidenced by a trail of the deceased’s
    blood; vii) the absence of injuries to the appellant that would have caused
    him to bleed; viii) the absence of blood in the driver’s seat of the deceased’s
    car; ix) the absence of visible blood on the gold chain when it was discovered;
    x) the failure to discover blood on the north side of the Humber River where
    the appellant was found; x) a yellow utility knife without a blade discovered
    near the appellant and xi) the blade from a utility knife on a road near
    the scene of the murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    as whole, in our view, it would have been open to the jury to infer on the
    basis of this evidence that the appellant and the co-accused formed an intention
    in common to carry out a robbery before the deceased was murdered and that
    the appellant knew that his co-accused had a gun and that the murder was
    a probable consequence of the robbery. Accordingly, we do not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the
    jury concerning s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The appellant argues
    that the trial judge’s instructions concerning this sub-section were confusing,
    that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on the doctrine of recent
    possession and that, in any event, the trial judge’s instructions concerning
    the inferences that could be drawn based on recent possession were flawed.
    We do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    appellant’s counsel advanced the position that the trial judge’s instructions
    concerning s. 21(2) were confusing, in oral argument, he properly conceded
    that the trial judge’s instructions were legally correct and that any potential
    confusion arising from the initial instructions was clarified in subsequent
    instructions in both the charge and the recharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s argument that the trial judge erred in leaving the doctrine of
    recent possession was founded on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Laliberty</i> (1997),
    117 C.C.C. (3d) 97. However, <i>Laliberty</i> does not stand for the proposition
    that it is an error in law to charge the jury on recent possession in circumstances
    such as these: see <i>Laliberty</i> at para. 43. Moreover, unlike the trial
    judge in <i>Laliberty</i>, the trial judge in this case did not tell the
    jury that recent possession creates any form of presumption; rather, he instructed
    them that it creates a permissible inference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the trial judge’s initial instructions concerning the inferences
    that could be drawn from a finding that the appellant was in possession of
    the deceased’s necklace were flawed. However, defence counsel objected to
    this aspect of the charge and approved the trial judge’s recharge on the
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the recharge, the trial judge explained that his initial instruction that
    it would be open to the jury to find that the appellant was a secondary party
    to murder based on a finding that the appellant was in personal possession
    of the deceased’s gold necklace before the murder was incorrect. Instead,
    the available inference would be that the appellant was an active participant
    in a robbery or theft of the chain and the jury would have to go on to determine,
    based on other evidence, whether the appellant aided or abetted the co-accused
    for the purpose of committing murder or subjectively knew that murder would
    be a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not explicitly refer to common purpose in the recharge,
    that issue was fully canvassed elsewhere in his charge and in the “Essential
    Matters” sheet given to the jury. Moreover, defence counsel did not request
    a specific instruction on that issue in the recharge. We do not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury
    that abetting may include “purposeful presence at the scene of a crime”.
    The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to make it clear that abetting
    requires an intention to encourage, and something more than mere passive
    presence at the scene of a crime. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this submission. In addition to the impugned statement, the trial
    judge explicitly instructed the jury that abetting means,
    “encouraging someone in any manner to commit an offence.” The trial judge
    also told the jury that neither accidental presence nor passive presence
    at the scene of a crime is sufficient. Finally, the trial judge made the
    impugned statement by way of contrast to his earlier comments in order to
    explain to the jury that, in some circumstances, presence at a crime can,
    in itself, constitute encouragement and therefore amount to abetting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Sentence Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in principle by increasing the
    appellant’s period of parole ineligibility to twelve years. While acknowledging
    that the murder was callous, the appellant points to the facts that: he was
    not the actual killer, he had no prior criminal record, he was 26 years of
    age at the time of the offence, and was the father of a young child. In addition,
    the appellant argues that, since ten members of the jury recommended only
    ten years of parole ineligibility, that period should not have been increased.
    Finally, the appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence to show his positive
    progress during his imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in principle in the period of parole ineligibility imposed by
    the trial judge. The trial judge explicitly considered the factors prescribed
    in s. 745.4 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the relevant principles of sentencing,
    including the character of the offender, the nature of the offence, the circumstances
    surrounding its commission and the jury’s recommendations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the trial judge had regard to the appellant’s active participation
    as an aider and abettor, the callous stalking of the victim, and the high
    degree of prolonged brutality and violence ending with what amounted to “a
    horrific execution” using a firearm in a residential neighbourhood. The trial
    judge appreciated that the appellant took a lesser role in the murder; this
    is reflected in his imposition of the higher period of ineligibility of twenty-years
    for the co-accused, which we have concluded in separate reasons was appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also took into consideration the Crown’s argument for a fifteen-year
    ineligibility - the period recommended by two of the jurors - and the submission
    of defence counsel at trial that no increase was warranted. In our view,
    the period imposed by the trial judge was within the range. Moreover, although
    the appellant’s positive progress in jail is commendable, it does not justify
    altering the original disposition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave
    to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
