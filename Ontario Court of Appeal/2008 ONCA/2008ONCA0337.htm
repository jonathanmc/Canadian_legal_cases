line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a trial before Ewaschuk J. and a jury, the appellant Jason Bettencourt and
    his co-appellant Kenneth Kreiger were convicted of second degree murder for
    killing Omar MacFarlane. Mr. Bettencourt was sentenced to life imprisonment
    without eligibility for parole for 20 years. He appeals both his conviction
    and the period of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    killing took place around 5:00 o’clock in the morning in a quiet residential
    neighbourhood in Etobicoke. Mr. MacFarlane was brutally attacked in his car
    with a knife, then pursued after he managed to escape and shot twelve times.
    That the shooter had the <i>mens rea</i> for murder was not in dispute. A
    principal issue at trial, however, was the identity of the shooter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s theory was that Mr. Bettencourt was the shooter. It relied mainly
    on DNA evidence, which showed that Mr. Bettencourt’s blood was in the victim’s
    car, along the street where the victim ran when he escaped from his car,
    at the point where the victim’s body was found, and in the ravine into which
    the suspects fled. Forensic ballistics evidence and eyewitness evidence supported
    the story told by the blood evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bettencourt did not testify and did not call any evidence in his defence.
    However, he claimed that an unidentified third person was responsible for
    the shooting. He relied on the evidence of an eyewitness to the incident.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        The
      Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      his appeal against conviction, Mr. Bettencourt makes three submissions.
      First, he submits that the trial judge’s comments on the unreliability
      of the eyewitness identification evidence went beyond acceptable comment,
      usurped the function of the jury and thus deprived Mr. Bettencourt of a
      fair trial. Second, he submits that the trial judge erred in law by failing
      to tell the jury that to the extent the eyewitness identification evidence
      was exculpatory, it need only raise a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s
      guilt. Third, Mr. Bettencourt submits that the trial judge erred in law
      in failing to instruct the jury that manslaughter was an available verdict
      for the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We
      did not call on the Crown on Mr. Bettencourt’s third submission. In our
      view, even if an unidentified third person was at the scene and responsible
      for the killing, there is no air of reality to a verdict of manslaughter.
      The blood evidence would at least implicate Mr.&nbsp;Bettencourt as a party
      to the murder with the requisite intent. We turn to the other two grounds
      of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s comments</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bettencourt contends that the trial judge’s comments about the unreliability
    of the eyewitness identification evidence were unacceptably strong and had
    the effect of taking away from the jury the one defence that he had. Mr.
    Bettencourt buttresses this submission by pointing to the trial judge’s instruction
    on the DNA evidence, which the trial judge told the jury was fundamental
    to determining whether the appellant shot Mr.&nbsp;MacFarlane. In combination,
    Mr. Bettencourt argues, these instructions destroyed his defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s comments on the identification evidence were undoubtedly very
    strong. But both the Supreme Court of Canada and this court have consistently
    said that trial judges are entitled to comment on the evidence, even in strong
    terms, so long as in doing so they do not express a personal opinion about
    an accused’s guilt or lead the jury to believe that it is bound by the trial
    judge’s comments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view the trial judge did not transgress the limits of acceptable comment.
    We say that for these reasons: He expressed no opinion about Mr. Bettencourt’s
    guilt; his comments were justified by the overwhelming strength of the Crown’s
    case against Mr. Bettencourt; he gave the standard instruction to the jury
    that they were the sole triers of fact and were free to disregard his comments;
    and, perhaps most important, after making these comments at the beginning
    of his overview of Mr. Bettencourt’s position he expressly told the jury, “It
    is you, the jury, who decide the truth of the case. You twelve people decide
    the facts; that is what actually happened. You are the final arbiters of
    the truth of the case”. Thus, we conclude that the trial judge’s comments
    did not usurp the jury’s function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the trial judge’s comments on the DNA evidence were fair. The blood evidence
    was central to the case, although undoubtedly damning for the defence’s position.
    Still, the trial judge stopped short of telling the jury that if it accepted
    the DNA evidence, it should find Mr. Bettencourt guilty. Instead, he simply
    left it open to the jury to convict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons we decline to give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the eyewitnesses described the height and weight of the person she saw
    in terms that were at odds with Mr. Bettencourt’s height and weight. The
    witness made her observation at night, was near-sighted and was not wearing
    her glasses. The Crown argued that she had observed Mr. Bettencourt and was
    simply mistaken in her description of him. The trial judge (in one of the
    comments impugned under the first ground of appeal) also told the jury that
    in his opinion the witness made “obvious errors” in her testimony about Mr.
    Bettencourt’s height and weight. The defence, however, relied on the eyewitness’s
    testimony in support of its theory that an unidentified third man was responsible
    for the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge appropriately cautioned the jury about the frailties of eyewitness
    identification evidence. However, Mr. Bettencourt argues that because the
    evidence of the witness was potentially exculpatory, the trial judge was
    obliged to go further and tell the jury that it may rely on this evidence
    in support of the defence position if it leaves the jury with a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. Wristen</i> (1999), 47 O.R.
    (3d) 66 at para.&nbsp;46, it would have been preferable had the trial judge
    given the instruction sought by the appellant. However, as we have already
    said, the Crown’s case against Mr.&nbsp;Bettencourt was overwhelming and
    in our view, the eyewitness identification evidence appeared unreliable.
    Thus, the trial judge’s failure to give the instruction sought by Mr. Bettencourt
    did not prejudice him. We therefore do not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bettencourt does not claim that the trial judge made an error in principle
    in fixing parole ineligibility at 20 years. Instead, he says that 20 years
    exceeds an acceptable range. We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a murder of extraordinary violence, cruelty and inhumanity. Mr.&nbsp;Bettencourt
    relentlessly pursued the victim, eventually shooting him a dozen times, including
    six shots to the face and two to the chest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bettencourt’s moral culpability was very high. The impact of the murder on
    the victim’s family has been devastating. And we have no evidence that would
    warrant any leniency. We have no evidence of good character, no mitigating
    factors in Mr.&nbsp;Bettencourt’s background. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    together, these considerations justify the 20 year period of parole ineligibility
    imposed by the trial judge. Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
