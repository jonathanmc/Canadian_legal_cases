  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal has a long history.  In December 1999, a jury in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Lindsay,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario convicted the appellant of the first degree murder of David Hanson.  He
    received the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility
    for parole for twenty-five years.  The appellant appealed, alleging various
    errors by the trial judge and contending that the first degree murder conviction
    was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal was not perfected for several years.  Eventually, the court made an
    order requiring perfection of the appeal by February 2004.  Shortly after
    the appeal was perfected, it was listed for argument in September 2004.  At
    the request of counsel for the appellant, the appeal was adjourned to November
    2004.  The day before the appeal was to be heard, counsel requested a further
    adjournment.  He advised that the adjournment was required to assemble the
    material necessary for a motion to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal.  The
    fresh evidence challenged toxicology evidence that had been adduced by the
    Crown at trial.  The appeal was adjourned.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fresh evidence application grew to include not only toxicology evidence but
    evidence challenging features of the pathology evidence adduced at trial.  The
    Crown and defence interviewed various experts and prepared several affidavits.  The
    parties cross-examined some of the affiants.  This process took a long time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal was eventually scheduled for December 2007.  Counsel filed several
    volumes of evidence on the motion to adduce fresh evidence.  Broadly speaking,
    the evidence falls into one of two categories.  The first category of evidence,
    which I will refer to as the toxicology evidence, contradicts Crown evidence
    led at trial relating to the concentration of alcohol in the deceased’s blood
    and urine, and the inference that could be drawn as to how long before his
    death the deceased had his last drink.  The defence had not challenged this
    evidence at trial.  The Crown concedes that the toxicology evidence offered
    on appeal is correct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second category of fresh evidence, which I refer to as the pathology evidence,
    challenges various aspects of the pathology evidence led by the Crown at
    trial.  Most, if not all, of the issues raised by the pathology evidence
    were challenged by the defence at trial.  The Crown contends that the pathology
    evidence offered on appeal consists of further opinions confirming the defence
    opinions advanced at trial and refuting the contradictory opinions advanced
    by the Crown.  The Crown has also provided pathology evidence on appeal,
    which it contends supports the evidence it called at trial.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to relying on the proposed fresh evidence, counsel advanced grounds
    of appeal arising out of the trial record.  He submitted that errors made
    at the trial warranted the quashing of the conviction.  Counsel further argued
    that even in the absence of error, the evidence only justifies a second degree
    murder conviction, not a first degree murder conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of the arguments advanced by the appellant, save the contention that the
    evidence does not support the conviction on the first degree murder charge,
    would, if successful, result in a new trial on the charge of first degree
    murder.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  If the appellant is correct that the evidence
    does not support the first degree murder conviction, he is entitled either
    to a new trial on a charge of second degree murder or to the substitution
    of a conviction on the charge of second degree murder, depending on the merits
    of the other grounds of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    submission that the evidence could not support a conviction on first degree
    murder must be rejected.  A review of the evidence demonstrates that there
    was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that the appellant,
    who had a reason to want Mr. Hanson dead, planned to kill Mr. Hanson at their
    pre-arranged meeting.  There was evidence that the appellant killed Hanson
    at the marina and put in play a scheme whereby he destroyed evidence at the
    marina and engaged in an elaborate effort to make it look as though Mr. Hanson
    had died when his car crashed into the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  Some of the appellant’s conduct on the night of Hanson’s death, and
    in the subsequent days, could also constitute evidence that the murder was
    planned and deliberate.  I cannot say that a conviction for first degree
    murder would be unreasonable.  Consequently, there is no basis to substitute
    a conviction for second degree murder, or if a new trial is ordered, to order
    the new trial on the charge of second degree murder.  There are two options.  Either
    the appeal should be dismissed and the conviction on first degree murder
    affirmed, or the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered on the
    charge of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant is entitled to a new trial if the court concludes that either the
    toxicology or the pathology evidence is admissible on appeal.  The admissibility
    of the toxicology evidence and the admissibility of the pathology evidence
    raise somewhat different issues.  The admissibility of the toxicology evidence
    is a more straightforward question and since it will dispose of the appeal,
    I will consider it first.  For reasons I will explain, the admissibility
    of that evidence comes down to whether it could reasonably be expected to
    have affected the verdict at trial.  I am satisfied that the evidence could
    have that effect, that it must be admitted on appeal, and that a new trial
    on the charge of first degree murder must be ordered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    examining the admissibility of the toxicology evidence, I will summarize
    the trial evidence.  I do so in some detail both to put the toxicology evidence
    in context and to demonstrate that there was ample evidence to support a
    conviction on the charge of first degree murder.  </p>

  <h4>THE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL</h4>
  <h2>            (a)  The Position of the Parties</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the Crown’s theory, the appellant wanted David Hanson dead for personal and
    business reasons.  He arranged to meet with Hanson in the early evening of
    January 11, 1998 at the marina that Hanson owned, which was also where the
    appellant worked.  The marina was not open, and no one else was there.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown contended that very shortly after Hanson arrived at the marina, the
    appellant hit him on the head, rendering Hanson unconscious but not dead.  On
    the Crown’s case, the appellant, as he had planned, cleaned up the scene,
    loaded Hanson’s body into Hanson’s car and drove the car with Hanson’s body
    in the driver’s seat slowly into the nearby
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Canal – all in an attempt to make Hanson’s death look like an accident.  Hanson’s
    body and his car were pulled from the canal a few days later.  On the Crown’s
    case, Hanson was alive, though incapacitated by the blow to the head, when
    the car went into the water.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the Crown’s theory, after driving the car into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Canal, the appellant extracted himself from the vehicle and went ashore.  According
    to his plan, the appellant made his way to a nearby, vacant, white cottage
    that he partly owned to get out of his wet clothing.  It was bitterly cold
    that night.  The appellant changed from his wet clothing in the cottage,
    warmed himself, and then went back to the marina to continue cleaning the
    murder scene.  In the following days, before Hanson’s body was found, the
    appellant carried on as if Hanson was alive.  He also lied to various friends
    and the police about his knowledge of Hanson’s whereabouts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant told a different story when he testified.  He met with Hanson at
    the marina in the early evening of January 11 to discuss various business
    matters.  The meeting was friendly until Hanson suddenly lost his temper
    for no apparent reason.  Hanson pushed the appellant, knocking him backwards.  The
    appellant, who was now seated, looked up to see Hanson coming towards him.  He
    pushed back against Hanson.  Hanson fell, striking his head on a metal tongue
    of a boat trailer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that when it became clear to him that Hanson was dead,
    he panicked.  After some brief reflection, he decided to make Hanson’s death
    look like a suicide and to kill himself at the same time.  The appellant
    described loading Hanson’s body into Hanson’s car and driving it into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  The appellant insisted that he was convinced that Hanson was dead
    before he loaded him into the car and drove him into the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  The appellant also insisted that he fully intended to kill himself.  According
    to him, he was travelling at over one hundred kilometres per hour when he
    went into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Canal.  The appellant changed his mind about committing suicide after the
    car went into the canal.  He was not sure how he managed to survive the crash.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant admitted that both before and after driving Hanson’s vehicle into
    the water, he made efforts to clean up the homicide scene at the marina.
    He also pretended to know nothing about Hanson’s whereabouts while the police
    and Hanson’s family were looking for him.  The appellant also admitted that
    he lied to friends and the police for weeks about his knowledge of the events
    surrounding Hanson’s death.  </p>

    appellant purchased the Rosedale Marina on the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trent River in 1975.  In the summer of 1996, the business went into receivership.  David
    Hanson, who had known the appellant for many years, purchased the business
    in January 1997.  He hired the appellant to run the day-to-day operation
    of the marina.  Hanson lived in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto during the week and went to the marina on weekends.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was evidence that the working relationship between the appellant and Hanson
    was not a smooth one.  The appellant was a workaholic and had put all of
    his efforts into the marina for more than twenty years.  He did not think
    that Hanson was capable of running the business.  The appellant saw himself
    as the legitimate owner.  For his part, Hanson became concerned about the
    appellant’s honesty.  He thought the appellant was making deals on boats
    at the marina behind Hanson’s back.  According to the Crown’s evidence, by
    late 1997, the appellant was both dissatisfied with Hanson’s operation of
    the marina and worried that Hanson might fire him.  The appellant told one
    customer that Hanson would not put the needed money into the marina and that
    he wanted to get Hanson out of the business. </p>

    appellant testified that he and Hanson disagreed from time to time about
    the operation of the marina but that none of these disagreements were serious.  He
    thought he had a good working relationship with Hanson.  He considered him

    that relationship had apparently ended, the appellant began a romantic relationship
    with

    Cork in November 1997.  Neither the appellant nor

    his testimony, the appellant described in some detail how he and Hanson drove
    to a showroom where several boats were stored.  They walked around the property,
    examining some changes the appellant had made.  The appellant testified that
    he and Hanson drove back to the main showroom and went to the downstairs
    office area at the marina.  Hanson was relaxed and in a good mood.  He seemed
    happy with the work the appellant had done at the marina while Hanson was
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that when he returned with the coffee, Hanson’s mood
    had changed.  He was angry and told the appellant to “keep his hands” off
    Ms. Cork.  The appellant insisted that he had no interest in her.  Hanson
    reached out and “whacked” the appellant on the shoulder.  The appellant staggered
    backwards, bumped his head on the cleat of a boat, swung around and fell
    into a chair.  As he pushed himself up from a seated position in the chair,
    he saw Hanson coming towards him.  The appellant put out both hands, closed
    his eyes and pushed hard against Hanson.  He opened his eyes to see Hanson
    falling backwards with his feet up in the air.  Hanson struck his head on
    the tongue of a trailer and fell to the floor.  </p>

    appellant testified that he immediately went to Hanson’s aid.  He shook him
    and felt for a pulse.  He also tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation about ten
    times, but nothing happened.  It was obvious to the appellant that Hanson
    was dead.  He sat down and started thinking about “all the things that had
    gone wrong”.  After a few moments, the appellant thought,
    “well I can’t take any more of this as I just wanted to end it.”  He decided
    he would make Hanson’s death look like an accident and kill himself at the
    same time.  </p>

    appellant drove Hanson’s car into the showroom and dragged his body over
    to the car.  Hanson was a very large person, weighing well over two hundred
    pounds, so the appellant used the hydraulics of a snow plow to lift the body
    and place it in the driver’s seat of Hanson’s car.  </p>

    a dinner party at 6:30 p.m.  Even though he was planning to kill himself,
    he phoned the host to say that he would be late.  The appellant also mentioned

    standing in front of a friend’s home.  The appellant had lost a shoe, and
    he was soaking wet.  It was very cold.  He did not recall going to his cottage.  The
    appellant testified that he walked back to the marina, put on some boots
    and drove himself home.  When he arrived home, the appellant started a fire,
    changed his clothes and took a shower.  He burned his clothing and the one

    Crown did not have direct evidence to contradict the appellant’s version
    of the events on the evening of January 11.  It offered forensic evidence
    to support the contention that the appellant had struck Mr. Hanson on the
    head, rendering him unconscious, loaded his body into Hanson’s car, and drove
    it into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hanson
    had an eight-centimetre laceration on his head and a very significant skull
    fracture.  Dr. McAuliffe, who performed the autopsy, testified that the head
    injury was more consistent with a severe blow from a heavy object than from
    a fall.  He further testified that for the injury to be caused by a fall,
    Mr. Hanson would have had to fall from a considerable height – for example,
    from a ladder.  Dr. McLellan, a trauma specialist, agreed with Dr. McAuliffe
    that the head injury was more consistent with an injury from a blow than
    with an injury from a fall.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    McAuliffe testified that he believed that Hanson was alive when he went into
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  He concluded that death was caused by
    “drowning complicating blunt force head injury”.  Dr. McAuliffe agreed that
    it was difficult to determine whether a dead person found in water had died
    from drowning.  He also indicated that he did not perform certain tests that
    could have assisted in making that determination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    McLellan, the trauma specialist, believed that Hanson’s head injury was not
    necessarily fatal.  He also testified that if Hanson died within thirty minutes
    of suffering the head injury, Hanson’s pulmonary oedema would not have been
    the product of his head injury.  Pulmonary oedema is one indicator of death
    by drowning.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    Markesteyn and King, two pathologists who testified for the defence, indicated
    that the injuries were consistent with a fall and inconsistent with a blow
    to the head.  They believed that Hanson died very quickly after receiving
    the head injury.  Dr. King examined the trailer tongue that the appellant
    said Hanson had struck when he fell and testified that the laceration on
    Hanson’s head was consistent with an injury caused by striking the tongue
    of the trailer.  </p>

    defence experts testified that it could not be determined whether Mr. Hanson
    had died by drowning.  In their opinion, there was no evidence corroborative
    of drowning, and no evidence that would permit the exclusion of drowning
    as a cause of death.  Neither Dr. Markesteyn nor Dr. King was in a position
    to challenge Dr. McLellan’s opinion with respect to the pulmonary oedema.<a href="#_ftn2"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    expert in blood-spatter patterns called by the Crown testified that the discernible
    spatters (the appellant had attempted to clean the scene) were inconsistent
    with the appellant’s version of events and consistent with the version advanced
    by the Crown.  The same expert opined that stepping in a pool of blood, as
    the appellant claimed he had done, would not have caused the observed spatter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    blood-splatter expert examined traces of the appellant’s blood found on a
    forklift tine.  The blood was found on all four sides of the tine.  This
    was consistent with evidence given by Steven Shepherd, a friend of the appellant’s.  Shepherd
    testified that sometime after Hanson’s death, the appellant told him that
    he had smeared his own blood on the forklift tine in an effort to create
    evidence consistent with his explanation as to how he had cut his head.  Had
    the smear been caused by the appellant actually striking his head on the
    tine, there would not have been blood on all four sides of the tine unless
    it went through his head.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also called William Robinson, a toxicologist.  He testified that, based
    on alcohol levels in Hanson’s blood and urine, Hanson had stopped drinking
    no more than fifteen to twenty minutes before his death.  The significance
    of this evidence is discussed in detail below.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also called the evidence of an accident reconstructionist.  He testified
    that Hanson’s car sustained minimal damage when it went into the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  The damage was consistent with the car travelling at a speed of fifty
    to sixty-five kilometres an hour on entry into the water and not at over
    one hundred kilometres per hour as the appellant had testified.  The vehicle
    also missed various obstacles located near where it went into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  Had the vehicle hit any of these obstacles, it would have suffered
    significantly more damage than it did.  The Crown theorized that the appellant
    had carefully driven the vehicle into the canal at a relatively slow speed
    to miss these obstacles.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    accident reconstructionist also observed a crack on the windshield on the
    front passenger’s side.  The crack was consistent with having been caused
    when the mirror struck the front window.  The cut on the appellant’s head
    was consistent with contact with the mirror.  Hanson’s head laceration was
    inconsistent with having been caused in the accident.  Hand smears on the
    passenger’s side of the dashboard were consistent with someone in the passenger’s
    seat bracing himself when the vehicle made impact with the water.  </p>
  <h2>            (iv)  The Appellant’s Trip to the White Cottage</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also relied on evidence that the appellant went to a white cottage,
    which he partly owned and was located very near the scene of the crash, immediately
    after he got out of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  The cottage was vacant and was not in regular use during the winter.  The
    Crown maintained that the appellant went to the cottage to warm himself and
    get out of his wet clothing, and that these actions indicated that the crash
    was part of a prior plan to murder Hanson.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Physical
    evidence, including footprints in the snow and glass from Hanson’s vehicle,
    established that the appellant went to the cottage after he crashed the car
    and got out of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  According to Mr. Shepherd, the appellant told him that when he got
    out of the water, he went to his cottage to change his wet clothes and warm
    himself.  The Crown argued that the appellant must have put a fresh set of
    clothing in the cottage before the meeting with Hanson at the marina, a clear
    indication, according to the Crown, that the murder was planned.  The Crown
    also argued that, given the very cold temperatures, ready access to shelter
    and dry clothing near the scene where he drove the car into the canal was
    a crucial component of the plan.  The appellant’s vacant cottage provided
    that shelter.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also submitted that it was significant that when the appellant climbed
    out of the canal, he went to his vacant cottage rather than to any of the
    other nearby occupied residences.  The Crown submitted that this conduct
    was much more consistent with a person who was putting a prior plan to kill
    Hanson into effect than with a person who had accidentally killed Hanson,
    and in a panic tried to kill himself and then changed his mind and was trying
    to save himself.        </p>

    his knowledge of what had happened to Hanson.  Finally, on January 27, about
    two weeks after Hanson’s death, the appellant told Mr. Shepherd a version
    of events that was similar to, but not quite the same as, the version of
    events that the appellant eventually gave on the witness stand.</p>

  <h4>THE TOXICOLOGY EVIDENCE</h4>
  <h2>      (a)  The Evidence at Trial</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>William
    Robinson, a forensic toxicologist with the Centre of Forensic Sciences, testified
    for the Crown.  He indicated that blood and urine samples were taken from
    Mr. Hanson’s body at the time of the autopsy.  The blood sample taken from
    the heart contained 53 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  The
    urine sample contained 29 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of urine.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Robinson was asked to explain why the alcohol levels were different in the
    blood and urine samples.  He answered:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The urine is
    a collection of the blood alcohol concentrations of alcohol over a period
    of time.  In this instance, with the blood being higher in concentration
    than the urine, it would indicate that the person has recently consumed alcohol
    prior to his death and that he has not reached his maximum blood alcohol – or
    his maximum blood alcohol concentration.  <u>So in other words, he was either
    actively drinking when he died or had finished drinking shortly prior to
    that, and the urine had yet to catch up to what the blood alcohol concentration
    was.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response to further questions, Mr. Robinson indicated that Hanson would have
    had his last drink “up to 15 to 20 minutes”
    prior to his death.  Counsel for Reeve did not cross-examine Mr. Robinson
    on this part of his evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the appellant’s version of events, Hanson arrived at the marina almost
    an hour before the altercation during which Hanson struck his head.  Also
    according to the appellant’s version of events, he and Hanson were together
    for about thirty-five minutes before the altercation.  The appellant also
    testified that it was about 6:30 p.m., some two hours after Hanson arrived
    at the marina, when he drove Hanson’s vehicle with Hanson’s body in it into
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  The appellant confirmed that Hanson did not have anything to drink
    while they were together at the marina.  He did not notice any indication
    that Hanson had been drinking until he tried to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown relied on Mr. Robinson’s opinion that Hanson had his last drink fifteen
    to twenty minutes before he died, together with the appellant’s evidence
    that Hanson had nothing to drink while they were together, to support the
    Crown’s claim that Hanson died very shortly after he arrived at the marina
    and met the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submitted to the jury that a finding that Mr. Hanson died very shortly
    after he arrived at the marina supported the Crown’s case in three ways.  First,
    it undermined the credibility of the appellant’s version of events at the
    marina.  On that version, given in some detail by the appellant, the two
    men were together at the marina for considerably longer than twenty minutes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the evidence supported the Crown’s claim that the appellant had planned the
    murder.  If Mr. Hanson was struck shortly after he arrived at his meeting,
    this suggested that the blow was the product of a prior plan.  That inference
    became particularly strong if, as the Crown claimed, Mr. Hanson did not die
    until he was in the canal.  On that view of the evidence, he must have suffered
    the head injury virtually upon his arrival at the marina.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the Crown submitted that the toxicology evidence, considered along with the
    evidence of Dr. McLellan, the trauma specialist, supported the Crown’s theory
    that Hanson was alive when his car went into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trent River and that he drowned.  Dr. McLellan testified that one would not
    expect to find pulmonary oedema as a result of a head injury within fifteen
    or twenty minutes of that injury occurring.  On the toxicology evidence,
    combined with the appellant’s evidence that Hanson was not drinking at the
    marina, the blow causing the head injury could not have been struck more
    than twenty minutes before Hanson’s death.  According to Dr. McLellan, if
    the pulmonary oedema occurred within twenty minutes, it could not have been
    caused by a head injury.  This left drowning as the probable explanation
    for the pulmonary oedema.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was not essential that the Crown prove that Hanson drowned for the Crown
    to establish its case.  The Crown’s case was, however, stronger if the jury
    concluded that Hanson drowned, not that he died at the marina.  If the jury
    was satisfied that Hanson was still alive at the marina, then that finding
    would undermine the truthfulness of the appellant’s description of the steps
    he took to try to assist Hanson.  Further, if the jury was satisfied that
    Hanson was still alive, it would not be difficult for the jury to conclude
    that the appellant knew Hanson was still alive when he loaded him into the
    car and drove into the canal.  Obviously, if the jury made those findings,
    the appellant’s fate was sealed.      </p>

    for the appellant retained two forensic toxicologists.  The Crown retained
    one.  I need not review the details of their opinions.  All of them agree
    that Mr. Robinson’s testimony that it could be determined that Hanson had
    his last drink fifteen or twenty minutes before his death based on the different
    alcohol levels in his blood and urine is scientifically unsound and incorrect.  The
    state of the toxicology evidence on appeal is summarized in a letter written
    by Crown counsel to appellant’s counsel:</p>

    avoiding a miscarriage of justice by having the appellate court consider
    all evidence relevant to the reliability of the conviction, but also to the
    broader societal interest in maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice
    system.  That integrity is maintained by respecting the finality of verdicts
    reached at trial and acknowledging the respective functions and expertise

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Evidence
    offered on appeal is admissible only if the first two questions are answered
    in the affirmative.  The first question recognizes that the rules of evidence
    applicable in criminal trials also apply on appeal:  <i>R. v. Archer</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    para. 102. The second question, aptly described as the “cogency” inquiry,
    has three parts.  The proffered evidence must be relevant to a potentially
    decisive issue; the evidence must be reasonably capable of belief; and the
    evidence must be sufficiently probative that when taken with the rest of
    the evidence adduced at trial, it could reasonably be expected to have affected
    the result.  </p>

    third and final inquiry, which need be addressed only if the evidence meets
    the requirements of the first two inquiries, is often described as the “due
    diligence” inquiry.  This third inquiry serves a different purpose than the
    other two.  The reasons the evidence was not adduced at trial are examined
    to determine whether broader interests necessary to the maintenance of the
    integrity of the criminal justice system, such as finality, merit the exclusion
    of the evidence despite its admissibility according to the rules of evidence
    and its potential probative value.  Depending on the reason for the failure
    to adduce the evidence at trial, evidence offered on appeal may be rejected
    even though it meets the criteria implicit in the first two inquiries.  An
    appeal court must examine the reasons for the failure to adduce the evidence
    at trial and factor those reasons, along with its assessment of the cogency
    of the evidence, into an overall determination of whether the interests of
    justice require that the evidence be received on appeal: see <i>R. v. Maciel</i> (2007),
    219 C.C.C. (3d) 516 at paras. 36-55 (Ont.

    counsel accepts that the toxicology evidence proffered on appeal is admissible
    under the rules of evidence governing criminal trials.  Crown counsel also
    acknowledges that the evidence is relevant to issues that were potentially
    decisive issues in the trial.  As outlined above, the Crown relied on the
    inference flowing from the toxicology evidence adduced at trial to undermine
    the credibility of the appellant’s description of his meeting with Hanson
    at the marina on January 11.  The appellant’s credibility was central to
    his defence.  The Crown also relied on the evidence to support its contention
    that the appellant killed Hanson very shortly after Hanson arrived at the
    marina.  If the jury drew this inference, a further inference of planning
    and deliberation could well follow.  Finally, the evidence offered some support,
    when combined with Dr. McLellan’s evidence, to support the Crown’s contention
    that Hanson drowned.  If the jury reached that conclusion, it may well also
    have concluded that the appellant appreciated that Hanson was still alive
    when he loaded him into the car and drove into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also acknowledges that there is no question about the credibility of
    the toxicology evidence.  The Crown accepts that the evidence put forward
    on appeal is factually correct and that the very different opinion evidence
    offered by the Crown at trial is entirely inaccurate.  </p>

    Crown takes its stand against the admissibility of the toxicology evidence
    on the third component of the cogency inquiry.  The Crown submits that evidence
    that Mr. Hanson may have had his last drink more than an hour before his
    death rather than fifteen or twenty minutes before his death could not reasonably
    be expected to have affected the verdict at trial when placed in the context
    of the rest of the evidence.  The Crown submits that the appellant’s credibility
    was so bankrupt and the Crown’s case on planning and deliberation so strong
    that the neutralization of the toxicology evidence could not realistically
    be expected to have affected either the jury’s assessment of the appellant’s
    credibility or its conclusion that the murder was planned and deliberate.  </p>

    testing the Crown’s argument against the admissibility of the toxicology
    evidence, it is important to bear in mind that the appellant does not have
    to show that the evidence would probably have affected the result at trial.  Nor,
    however, is it enough for the appellant to show that the evidence is credible
    and relevant and could possibly have affected the result at trial.  The cogency
    bar rests somewhere between those two standards.  The appellate court must,
    to some extent, weigh the potential probative value of the evidence proffered
    on appeal.  That weighing must be done in the context of the trial evidence
    and the positions advanced by the parties at trial.  If, on that assessment,
    this court concludes that the toxicology evidence heard on appeal could reasonably
    be expected to have changed the result at trial, then the toxicology evidence
    is admissible on appeal subject to a consideration of the explanation offered
    for the failure to adduce the evidence at trial:  see <i>Re Truscott</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    para. 100;  <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 91.</p>

    speaking, the now discredited toxicology evidence occupied a few seconds
    in a lengthy trial.  Experienced and able counsel who represented the appellant
    at trial (not Mr. Lockyer) has frankly acknowledged in his affidavit that
    Mr. Robinson’s answer concerning the length of time between Hanson’s last
    drink and his death went past him unnoticed when given by Mr. Robinson.  Crown
    counsel submits that experienced trial counsel’s non-reaction to the evidence
    is some indication of its relative insignificance at the trial.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is much to be said for the Crown’s contention that the appellant’s admitted
    mendacity in the days following the homicide, his acknowledged and extensive
    efforts to destroy evidence, and the implausibility of the story he told
    in his evidence would have destroyed his credibility in the eyes of any reasonable
    jury without reference to any inferences available from the now discredited
    toxicology evidence.  I also agree with the submission that even apart from
    the impugned evidence, the Crown had a formidable case for first degree murder,
    especially if the jury accepted the Crown’s interpretation of the evidence
    pertaining to the white cottage.  </p>

    the force of Crown counsel’s submissions, I have concluded that the toxicology
    evidence proffered on appeal could, when considered with the rest of the
    evidence at trial, be reasonably expected to have affected the result.  As
    outlined above, Mr. Robinson’s evidence was important to the Crown in establishing
    that Hanson died very shortly after he arrived at the marina.  Also, as outlined
    above, if the jury so concluded, it undermined the appellant’s credibility,
    supported the Crown’s allegation that the murder was planned and deliberate,
    and supported the Crown’s contention that Hanson drowned.  In addition to
    its relevance to these important issues, I think there is a real likelihood
    that the jury gave Mr. Robinson’s evidence significant weight.  Unlike much
    of the other expert evidence, it was unchallenged, and unlike much of the
    non-expert evidence, there was no questioning Mr. Robinson’s credibility.  He
    would be seen as giving an objective, scientifically-based, unchallenged
    opinion, exactly the kind of evidence that a jury could use to anchor its
    deliberations when examining the more contentious evidence.  </p>

    agree with Mr. Lockyer’s persuasive submission that the best way of looking
    at the potential value of this evidence to the different aspects of the Crown’s
    case is by examining the way Crown counsel used that evidence in her closing
    submissions.  Crown counsel forcefully connected the contention that Hanson
    died very quickly after he arrived at the marina to the three issues set
    out above.  For example, in the context of challenging the appellant’s credibility,
    Crown counsel reviewed his extensive and detailed evidence concerning the
    events at the marina involving himself and Hanson.  After pointing out that
    these events had to take much more than the fifteen to twenty minutes available
    on Mr. Robinson’s evidence, the Crown concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>These details,

    the experts aside, <u>fifteen to twenty minutes from the start of the meeting
    until David Hanson drowned in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Canal.  I suggest to you it would be impossible for a man in a panic to carry
    out an elaborate plan such as that in that short a period of time, especially
    one, as the defendant testified, who sat down and ruminated on his life</u> and
    his business dealings for some five or ten minutes, then cleaned up the murder
    scene prior to even disposing of David.  Not an accident, not self-defence,
    but a meticulous and calculated plan to murder David Hanson and dispose of
    his body.  Planned and deliberate.  First degree murder.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    his instructions, the trial judge, as required, reviewed the Crown’s position,
    including its reliance on Mr. Robinson’s evidence.  In reviewing the Crown’s
    position, the trial judge said in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The timing
      of the events described by the defendant in detail are totally inconsistent
      with the objective scientific evidence from the toxicologist who described
      Mr. Hanson as having either been consuming alcohol at the time he died
      or within fifteen minutes prior.</u>  That Michael Reeve testified he didn’t
      know David had been drinking until he smelled his breath after he had fallen.  That
      according to Mr. Reeve’s evidence it was forty to forty-seven minutes from
      the time that David Hanson arrived at the marina until Michael Reeve said
      that David Hanson experienced the fall.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s initial factum filed in response to the appeal before the toxicology
    evidence was put forward by the appellant also reflects the significance
    of the fifteen to twenty minute interval between Hanson’s last drink and
    his death.  In the factum, the Crown asserts:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidence
    of the timing of the events established that the appellant had to have a
    prior plan to have accomplished all he did in the fifteen to twenty minutes
    allowed.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown supported this submission by reference to some fifteen different things
    that the appellant had to do in the very short interval between striking
    Hanson and entering the cottage after getting out of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    am satisfied that the factual inference that Hanson was killed very shortly
    after he arrived at the marina played a significant role in the case submitted
    by the Crown to the jury.  That inference depended entirely on Mr. Robinson’s
    erroneous opinion.  While I accept that the Crown had a case for first degree
    murder without the inference that Hanson was killed very shortly after he
    arrived at the marina, the availability of that inference, especially when
    based on uncontested scientific evidence, strengthened the Crown’s case.  The
    toxicology evidence offered on appeal to the effect that the alcohol levels
    in the deceased’s urine and blood do not support the inference that Hanson
    died shortly after his arrival at the marina effectively negates an important
    inference relied on by the Crown at trial.  I think the toxicology evidence
    is sufficiently cogent to warrant its admission on appeal subject to the
    inquiry into the reasons for the failure to produce that evidence at trial.  </p>

    is the explanation for the failure to call the toxicology evidence adduced
    on appeal at trial?  The evidence was available at trial.  The expert opinions
    put before this court could have been put before the trial court.  There
    is nothing new about the science these experts have relied on in advancing
    their opinions.  Trial counsel has filed an affidavit on the appeal.  He
    frankly acknowledges in that affidavit that he did not think to challenge
    Mr. Robinson’s opinion.  Indeed, counsel did not even appreciate that Mr.
    Robinson had given that opinion until after the evidence was completed.  </p>

    counsel, in keeping with the proper role of the Crown, does not suggest that
    trial counsel’s failure to advert to the possibility that Mr. Robinson’s
    opinion was wrong amounts to a failure to exercise due diligence in the obtaining
    of evidence to contradict Mr. Robinson’s opinion.  Trials are dynamic and
    sometimes very hectic events.  Counsel have a lot on their mind.  This was
    a very complicated case and trial; counsel had much to contend with, including
    experts in several different fields.  It is not surprising that trial counsel,
    caught up in the frenetic pace of a jury trial, does not see each and every
    evidentiary issue that may become apparent in the quiet reflection of appellate
    preparation.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    fairness to trial counsel, it must be pointed out that Mr. Robinson’s report,
    which was provided to trial counsel as part of the Crown’s disclosure, made
    no reference to any estimate of the length of time between Hanson’s last
    drink and his death.  This line of questioning and Mr. Robinson’s response
    could not have been anticipated by trial counsel.  </p>

    counsel did come to appreciate the significance of Mr. Robinson’s opinion
    after hearing Crown counsel’s closing address and the trial judge’s instructions.  In
    his objections, counsel asked the judge to tell the jury that there was no
    scientific or mathematical basis for Mr. Robinson’s estimate of the time
    between the last drink and Hanson’s death.  Given Mr. Robinson’s unchallenged
    evidence before the jury, the trial judge, quite properly, refused to so
    instruct the jury.  As we now know, trial counsel’s objection hit the factual
    nail right on the head.  </p>

    essentially unchallenged explanation for the failure to adduce the toxicology
    evidence at trial does not tell against its admissibility on appeal.  The
    appellant does not seek to undo any tactical decision made at trial.  Nor
    does he seek to put evidence before this court that reasonably should have
    been before the trial court.  Rather, he seeks to put evidence of uncontested
    reliability before this court to correct an admitted error in the evidence
    adduced at trial.  The present evidence was not available at trial purely
    as a result of trial counsel’s understandable failure to anticipate the need
    for such evidence in his trial preparation and his understandable failure
    to perceive the significance of Mr. Robinson’s evidence when he gave it.  </p>

    is unfortunate that trial counsel did not seek, prior to trial, to obtain
    the kind of toxicology evidence that counsel secured for the appeal.  In
    a perfect world, he would have done so.  The criminal justice system does
    not operate in that world.  In the circumstances of this case, the best interests
    of the administration of justice are served by allowing the appellant to
    adduce evidence on appeal that is admittedly reliable and corrects a potentially
    significant factual error in the evidence led by the Crown at trial.  I would
    admit the toxicology evidence on appeal.  </p>

    one point during his oral argument in response to questions from the court,
    counsel for the appellant submitted that if the pathology evidence was admitted
    on appeal, it virtually excluded first degree murder as a reasonable verdict
    and that the appropriate order should be a new trial on second degree murder.  This
    submission assumes that the pathology evidence proffered on appeal establishes
    that Hanson’s head injury could not have been caused by a blow to the head.  I
    agree with the Crown’s contention that the pathology evidence, including
    the evidence offered by the Crown on appeal, does not go that far.  Whether
    the injury was caused by a blow or a fall remains a live issue even in the
    light of the fresh pathology evidence.</p>

    the defence experts and the Crown expert who gave evidence on appeal disagreed
    with Dr. McLellan.  They indicated that neurogenic pulmonary oedema may develop
    within minutes of a fatal head injury.  These opinions formed part of the
    pathology evidence offered on appeal.  I need not decide its admissibility.  It
    will presumably be available on the retrial.</p>
