style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of one count of fraud over $5,000.  A second count
    of fraud over $5,000 was stayed based on <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1
    S.C.R. 729.  The appellant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment,
    followed by eighteen months probation, and restitution in the amount of $22,500
    was ordered.  The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>
  <h2>A.        The Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of his conviction appeal, the appellant argues that the purpose of
    the criminal proceedings against him was the collection of a civil debt owed
    to the victims of his fraudulent conduct, with the result that the proceedings
    were an abuse of process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, the appellant submits that, in the course of discussions concerning
    restitution, it was made clear to him that the real goal of the prosecution
    was recovery or collection of the debt owed to the complainants and that
    payment would bring an end to the prosecution.  He says that the involved
    Crown counsel surrendered their obligations and breached their duties as
    Crown Attorneys by acting, in effect, as counsel for the complainants in
    attempting to obtain the highest monetary recovery possible from the appellant
    on account of the value of the services fraudulently obtained by him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    its core, therefore, the appellant’s contention is that Crown counsel improperly
    used the power of their office and the spectre of criminal prosecution to
    enforce the complainants’ demands for restitution.  We reject this argument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute that it is an abuse of process to use criminal proceedings
    for the sole purpose of collecting a civil debt.  In this context, Crown
    counsel on this appeal responsibly acknowledged that the language of certain
    of the e-mail communications between the Crown counsel involved in the appellant’s
    case was ill-advised.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown
    counsel also argues, however, that this is not one of those exceptional cases
    in which the jurisdiction of this court to prevent an abuse of process should
    be exercised by allowing the appeal and staying the charges against the appellant.  Again,
    we agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, on this record, the appellant has failed to meet the high threshold
    required for a stay of criminal proceedings based on alleged abuse of process.  We
    are far from satisfied that the sole purpose for the conduct of the criminal
    proceedings against the appellant was to effect collection of the civil debt
    owed by him to the complainants, thereby invoking the criminal justice process
    to realize a civil remedy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fresh evidence tendered on appeal by both parties indicates that Crown counsel
    assigned to the appellant’s case concluded that the charges were appropriate
    and that a reasonable prospect of conviction existed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, and importantly, the Crown counsel involved in the challenged resolution
    discussions testified that while he sought the complainants’ views regarding
    restitution, he did so in the course of assessing the public interest in
    determining whether to end or continue the prosecution and in the knowledge
    that the complainants’ views would not determine the course of the proceedings.
    He stated that it was his opinion, having regard to the public interest,
    that resolving the case on the basis of restitution in the proposed amount
    of $14,000 was not inappropriate, even though that quantum was less than
    what he viewed as the full value of the appellant’s fraud and the preferred
    restitutionary amount of $17,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    there is no evidentiary support on this record for the appellant’s very serious
    claim that Crown counsel threatened the appellant – implicitly or otherwise – with
    continued prosecution and jail if the appellant failed to increase the amount
    of restitution that he was prepared to pay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, we conclude that the record does not demonstrate
    any improper purpose behind the criminal proceedings or in the conduct of
    Crown counsel involved in those proceedings.  To the contrary, there was
    clear evidence in support of the allegations of the commission of a criminal
    offence by the appellant, the sufficiency of which he acknowledges.  A coincident
    effort to realize recovery of the debt owed to the complainants through the
    mechanism of restitution does not render the criminal proceedings an abuse
    of process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <h2>B.        The Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to his sentence appeal, the appellant argues that while he has a
    record for similar offences, it is dated.  He submits that the sentencing
    judge erred by failing to give proper consideration to relevant mitigating
    circumstances, including evidence of his good character, his involvement
    in the community and the dependency and ill-health of his wife.  He further
    submits that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons for sentence, delivered shortly after final submissions by counsel,
    the sentencing judge referred to the submissions made as to sentence and
    applied the appropriate sentencing principles.  He specifically recognized
    the importance of addressing specific and general deterrence in the circumstances
    of this case.  He then reviewed the aggravating and mitigating factors that
    emerged from the circumstances of this offence and this offender including,
    expressly, several of the mitigating factors identified by the appellant
    on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no basis on which to interfere with this sentence.  It is within the
    range for similar offences and reveals no error in principle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
