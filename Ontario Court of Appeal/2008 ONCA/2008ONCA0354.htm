    motorists driving north on Highway 400 Extension north of Barrie early in
    the morning of October 29, 2000, noticed an Oldsmobile Aurora in the median
    between the northbound and southbound lanes. The car was upside down, resting
    on its roof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    few drivers stopped their vehicles and approached the overturned car. They
    noticed one man staggering around near the Oldsmobile. The man said that
    his name was Mark. He claimed that another person, John, had been driving
    the car, but John had disappeared. The man who said that his name was Mark
    was Janusz Rybak (the appellant). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after police arrived at the accident scene, an officer arrested the appellant
    for public intoxication. The appellant became belligerent and was promptly
    handcuffed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    vehicle registration check revealed that the owner of the upturned car was
    Eva Papousek (the deceased) who lived in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Mississauga. When local police went to Ms. Papousek’s address at around 7:30
    a.m. on October 29, 2000, they found her body. Someone had strangled her
    to death. About four hours later, investigators from Peel Regional police
    arrested the appellant for the murder of the deceased. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a seven-week trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of second degree
    murder. The trial judge imposed the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for
    life and fixed the parole ineligibility period at the statutory minimum of
    ten years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction on the principal ground that the state failed
    to provide him with the interpreter assistance to which he was constitutionally
    entitled as a person who did not understand the language in which trial proceedings
    were conducted – English. He also asserts error in the reception and handling
    of certain evidence admitted at his trial, and alleges several shortcomings
    in the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>I.          THE FACTS</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecution’s case against the appellant was circumstantial, including evidence
    of motive, opportunity and post-offence conduct. The appellant, who did not
    testify or adduce evidence, denied participation in the death of the deceased
    and suggested that some third party, not further identified, caused her death. </p>
  <h3>The Relationship Between the Principals</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the fall, 2000, the appellant and deceased were living together in an apartment
    that the deceased rented in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Mississauga. She owned a burgundy-coloured Oldsmobile Aurora that she parked
    in space number 15 of a surface lot adjacent to the apartment building. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    time to time, the deceased earned money as an exotic dancer. She also tried
    her hand at selling real estate, but had little success. Unfortunately, the
    deceased was a frequent and overindulgent drinker whose character changed
    substantially when she drank to excess. </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Unravelling of the Relationship</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ruby
    Marcus, a former exotic dancer, was a good friend of the deceased. The two
    women talked frequently, often about relationships with men. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evening of October 27, 2000, the deceased told Ms. Marcus that she (the
    deceased) was unhappy in her relationship with the appellant, who took more
    money from their account than he deposited. The deceased had another romantic
    interest and wanted to rid herself of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his lengthy videotaped interview by investigating officers, the appellant
    denied any fissures in his relationship with the deceased. According to him,
    the couple planned to marry and raise a family. </p>
  <h3>The Evening of October 28, 2000</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    deceased was home during the evening of October 28, 2000. She talked to her
    ex-husband on the telephone around 10:00 p.m. about their son who was returning
    to live with his father, contrary to the deceased’s wishes. The appellant
    was there during their conversation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    residents of the apartment building where the appellant and deceased lived
    reported having heard a barking dog and loud music coming from the couple’s
    apartment at various times during the evening of October 28, 2000, and into
    the early morning of the following day. Some recalled a man and woman arguing
    and the women yelling “fuck you”, or something like that. </p>
  <h3>The Departure from the Apartment</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted to investigators that he and the deceased were together
    in their apartment during the evening of October 28, 2000. He said he left
    in the deceased’s car after midnight, more likely around 1:00 a.m. on October
    29, 2000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    apartment resident, Lee Barnes, said he saw a man with a German Shepherd
    dog on a leash at around 1:00 a.m. on October 29, 2000. He had seen this
    man, whom he identified at trial as the appellant, on several earlier occasions,
    with the deceased and the same dog. A woman also walked the dog. She drove
    a burgundy-coloured
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Aurora car and parked it in spot number 15. When Barnes saw the appellant
    walking the dog, the engine of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Aurora was running and its lights were on. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee
    Barnes was never shown a photographic line-up. He described the man as six
    feet tall with shoulder-length dark hair and a
    “scruffy” or “rocker” look about him. The description Barnes provided differed
    from the appellant’s appearance, at the very least in the length of his hair. </p>
  
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Cash Stop</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 28, 2000, the appellant had received $915 in cash for roofing work
    he had completed earlier that day. At 1:27 a.m. on October 29, 2000, the
    appellant made three separate withdrawals from the deceased’s bank account.
    Each transaction was for $100 and was processed at an ATM machine at a plaza
    about two kilometres away from the apartment building where the appellant
    and deceased lived. </p>
  <h3>The Motor Vehicle Accident</h3>
  
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    around 3:00 a.m. on October 29, 2000, the appellant was involved in a single
    car motor vehicle accident on the 400 Extension north of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Barrie. The car, the deceased’s Oldsmobile Aurora, ended up on its roof after
    rolling over. An accident reconstruction expert testified that the car was
    traveling at 143 kilometres per hour when the driver failed to negotiate
    a slight right curve. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scattered
    around the scene of the car accident were several items of the deceased’s
    property, including credit cards, jewellery, a purse and a pager. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    blood sample taken from the appellant at a local hospital at 5:15 a.m. on
    October 29, 2000, contained 154 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres
    of blood. By extrapolation, the appellant’s blood alcohol levels at the time
    the accident occurred would have been between 170 and 180 milligrams of alcohol
    in 100 millilitres of blood. At the accident scene, the appellant lied about
    his name and claimed that there had been another person in the car with him,
    its driver, John. The appellant had been the driver and sole occupant of
    the vehicle. </p>
  <h3>The Finding of the Deceased</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after 7:00 a.m. on October 29, 2000, police officers arrived at the door
    of the apartment where the appellant and deceased lived. The door was locked.
    No signs of forced entry were apparent. Inside the apartment, the officers
    found the body of the deceased, lying on her back with her arms extended.
    The position of the body was consistent with having been moved to or repositioned
    in its final place of rest. The telephone in the apartment was unplugged,
    the exterior door to the balcony open, and the interior door propped open.
    All the entertainment equipment was silent. </p>
  <h3>The Cause of Death</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    deceased died from strangulation, likely manual strangulation. Force had
    been applied directly to her neck and sustained for a period of two or three
    minutes. The examining pathologist could not rule out the application of
    an object across the front of her neck. No injuries to the side of the deceased’s
    neck were obvious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the deceased died, her blood alcohol concentration was 189 milligrams of
    alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Appellant’s Version of Events</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant chose not to testify or call witnesses, relying on a lengthy video-taped
    interview entered as part of the prosecution’s case to support his denial
    of guilt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted that he was in the apartment with the deceased from about
    five o’clock in the evening of October 28, 2000, until midnight or 1:00 a.m.
    the following day. He drank about eight beers before he left to play pool.
    He would not tell investigators whether anyone else was in the apartment
    with him and the deceased. The couple played music on the stereo and danced.
    The deceased, who was also drinking, fell down briefly while they were dancing.
    The dog was there and barked from time to time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied arguing with the deceased and insisted that he did not kill
    her. He mentioned that another person was driving the car when it left the
    travelled road surface of Highway 400 en route to Rama. He acknowledged using
    the deceased’s bank card, but pointed out to investigators that it was not
    unusual for him to do so. He explained that the deceased often left things,
    including money and jewellery, in her car, thus its presence on the ground
    at the accident scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    further references to the evidence adduced at trial on various procedural
    steps taken there is necessary to elucidate and determine the grounds of
    appeal raised, but can conveniently await that discussion. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>II.        THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s first and chief complaint is that, as a party who did not understand
    English, the language of trial, he did not receive the full measure of interpreter
    assistance to which section 14 of the <i>Charter</i> entitled him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further argues that the trial judge failed to properly instruct
    the jury about the limited use they could make of the evidence of Lee Barnes
    and of certain post-offence conduct of the appellant, about the mental element
    required for murder under s. 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the
    relevance of evidence of intoxication to its proof, and that the trial judge
    failed to properly relate various pieces of evidence introduced at trial
    to the presumption of innocence and the prosecutor’s obligation to prove
    the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in failing to require
    the prosecutor to call, or in failing to call as the judge’s own witness,
    Tammy Watson, a witness the prosecutor had called at the preliminary inquiry,
    and further erred in permitting a prosecution witness, Norman Sneddon, to
    give an opinion and demonstrate the “directionality” of a fingerprint. The
    appellant claims yet another error in the reception of the appellant’s videotaped
    interview by police.</p>

    to an understanding of the appellant’s complaint of constitutionally inadequate
    interpreter assistance is a brief resumé of some preliminary proceedings
    and various trial incidents that provide essential context for the grievance. </p>
  <h3>The Accident Investigation and Police Interview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay and read both the
    primary and secondary police caution. Within one and one-half hours of his
    arrest, the appellant had spoken with two duty counsel, one of whom, at his
    request, spoke Polish. </p>

    homicide investigators returned with the appellant to Peel Region, they attempted

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga. The interview, which was conducted entirely in English, was
    videotaped. At one point fairly early in the interview, the appellant mentioned
    the possibility of having a translator present:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Because you know plus you see I’m very tired, this,
    this and that you see and for me the best thing will be a translator okay
    to exactly understand the words and all this and that because if I will understand
    something, some words a little bit differently than I should and whatever
    I will say some word and this and that, you see in Polish we can talk no,
    no problem, I understand this language okay, the English I’m not so good,
    I never go to the school for English, nothing, I just, I just learned the
    English like this okay, by myself, by hearing, by this, by this, I didn’t
    go to the school.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>No efforts were made to obtain an

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <h3>The Preliminary Inquiry</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s preliminary inquiry took place in October, 2001, almost a year
    after his arrest. As the preliminary inquiry began, both the appellant and
    his [then] counsel made clear the nature and the extent of the interpreter
    assistance the appellant wanted and required:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. O’BRIEN: Yes, Your Honour, I’ve spoken to Mr.
    Rybak about this matter and I’ve spoke to the interpreter. It was thought
    that, at the time that this matter was set, there were some deficits in Mr.
    Rybak’s language, but the deficits are not severe. I’ve spent most of my
    time communicating with him in English and in my view his English is fairly
    solid, but the odd time he’ll run into a problem with a word or phrase, but
    it – it’s rare. So my thought was, rather than have the whole proceedings
    interpreted to him, which will take some time, that we could move along in
    English and if something comes up – and it may not – then the interpreter’s
    here to assist.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Maybe we can see how it goes for a day, and then
    re-evaluate it after that, as to whether or not we need to keep her in the
    courtroom, and she can maybe move on to other tasks.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: All right.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. O’BRIEN: If – if – </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Mr. Rybak, would you stand up, sir.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Is that agreeable with you, sir?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes, okay.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: If there is anything in this proceeding
    that occurs today that you don’t understand or you’re having any difficulty
    in understanding the witnesses who testify and you feel you need the assistance
    of the interpreter, let us know right away. You understand that?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes, sir.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: And you can do that by speaking to your
    lawyer and getting his attention, and he’ll bring that problem to my attention
    – </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes, sir.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: - okay?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes.</p>
  <h3>The Pre-Trial Motions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the pre-trial conference required by s. 625.1(2) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> for
    jury trials, counsel for the appellant does not appear to have asked that
    an interpreter be provided for the appellant’s trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pre-trial
    motions began on June 16, 2003 with a <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> to determine
    the admissibility of various responses made by the appellant to police officers,
    as well as a lengthy videotaped interview hours later after the appellant
    had spoken with counsel and had returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    after arraignment, defence counsel (who had not been counsel at the preliminary
    inquiry and was not counsel on the appeal) raised the need for an interpreter
    to assist the appellant in understanding the language at trial. Counsel said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Rybak can get by today without one. It would
    be preferable from our perspective if the court would consider ordering a
    Polish interpreter. Much of what transpires is completely comprehensible
    to Mr. Rybak; if things go quickly and certain words are used, it would be
    difficult for him to understand. I am quite sure we could proceed today but …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then spoke directly to the appellant: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: That if you have some problems you let
    Mr. Goldman or Mr. Boni know through one of the constables, or one of the
    security officers who are right beside you, and they could then indicate – or
    you could whisper to Mr. Goldman – that you’re not following, then we’ll
    have something repeated if that’s necessary. I’ll make certain that the witnesses
    don’t carry on at break-neck speed either, because I don’t appreciate that
    either, all right. So we’ll take care of that. But if there’s any problem,
    you let us know and then we’ll deal with it, because I don’t want you sitting
    there missing something. On one or two of these hearings that are going to
    take place
    – or motions – your input in this is going to be very important to your lawyers
    and to your position, so this isn’t a situation that we can take any chances
    with. So if you’re having trouble, let him know and then we’ll go about it.
    I know that you’re quite fluent in English, aren’t you?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Kind of, yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Well how long - you’ve been in this
    country quite a while, haven’t you?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes. Eight - eight years,
    I believe, yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. GOLDMAN: I think we can move along with this,
    Your Honour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge spoke directly to the appellant about his (the appellant’s) willingness
    to begin proceedings on the first day without an interpreter. The appellant
    confirmed what his counsel had said a few moments earlier: he was willing
    to proceed that day without an interpreter. The following exchange occurred:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:  - I mean we won’t begin without it.
    But you feel you can start and go ahead without any problem, is that right?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    proceedings began on the afternoon of the first day of pre-trial motions,
    defence counsel advised the trial judge that the appellant “would feel significantly
    better” with a Polish interpreter. When defence counsel mentioned to the
    trial judge that the appellant had comprehended “the gist” of what was going
    on, the trial judge interjected, immediately with an offer to start proceedings “all
    over again” by requiring the witnesses who had testified to return to repeat
    the evidence they had given that morning with an interpreter repeating in
    Polish for the appellant the proceedings conducted in English. Defence counsel
    expressly declined the offer as unnecessary. After further consultation with
    the appellant, defence counsel explained to the trial judge what was required
    commencing the following day:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. GOLDMAN: Yes, it - it’s as we thought, Your
    Honour, it’s - it’s - it’s - there are specific - specific words that are
    used and said that - that he doesn’t understand; it’s not that he doesn’t
    comprehend what’s going on or understand the nature of the proceedings by
    - by reason of the language difficulty. It - it comes down to specific words
    or phrases -</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Uh-huh.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MR. GOLDMAN: - so that in the - in the circumstance
    I - I’d just ask Your Honour – we would confirm our request to have an interpreter
    available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge directed the prosecutor to contact the Coordinator of Interpreters
    and obtain “their best Polish interpreter” for the following morning. The
    trial judge offered to re-commence the <i>voir dire</i> when the interpreter
    was provided, but defence counsel did not take him up on the offer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the afternoon of the first day of pre-trial motions, the trial judge inquired
    of the Coordinator of Interpreters about the availability of “a first-rate
    interpreter” for the following day and the remainder of the trial proceedings.
    The coordinator assured the trial judge that all the interpreters were “first-rate;
    they are all accredited by the Ministry of the Attorney General”. The trial
    judge was somewhat sceptical (not to mention prescient) about the abilities
    of some interpreters. He insisted on a proper interpreter for the trial proceedings. </p>
  <h3>The Selection and Instruction of the Interpreter</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the first interpreter who appeared the following morning.
    Another interpreter, Diana Zywulko, appeared. The interpreter and appellant
    confirmed their understanding of each other. The trial judge then instructed
    the interpreter about her duties and confirmed the appellant’s understanding:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: Now I’m told by his counsel and by him
    he’s been in this country eight years, he speaks English rather well, I think,
    but he has trouble with some phrases, so I’m going to leave it up to you.
    I don’t think you need to interpret everything that’s going on in the trial.
    But you work out your own arrangement, all right – that would be a big help
    to all of us. I don’t think you have to be continually going, but you - I
    know you’ve done this before. I don’t think I’ve had the pleasure of working
    with you but I’m not - I don’t think so. But in any event you two can work
    it out together, all right. In other words, he’ll let you know by eye contact,
    or whatever –
    whatever arrangement you make – that he’s having some difficulty, and then
    you can jump right in there. And if you need it to be slowed down a bit,
    you can let me know. All right. Now do you understand what I’ve just said?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes, sir.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT: So you two work it out together, all
    right. I don’t want you missing anything, but you’ve got a professional interpreter
    now and she’ll work with you, and there’s no need for her to be going on
    and on about that. Is that satisfactory to you?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ACCUSED, JANUSZ RYBAK: Yes, sir. Thank you very
    much.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    days later, the appellant indicated through his counsel that the interchange
    with the interpreter “is exceptionally good” and sought to have Ms. Zywulko
    continue as the interpreter (as she did) throughout the trial. </p>
  <h3>The Trial Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    proceedings began in late September, 2003. The jury returned its verdict
    on November 1, 2003. The trial record contains no complaint about the competence
    of the interpreter, nor of the manner in which the interpretation was provided.
    At no point did the appellant claim any lack of understanding of the proceedings
    or of the interpreter.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Fresh Evidence on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    support his claim of constitutionally inadequate interpreter assistance,
    the appellant sought leave to introduce fresh evidence on the hearing of
    the appeal. The respondent offered no resistance. The evidence consists of
    transcripts of testimony given by persons responsible for the assignment
    and supervision of interpreters in the Regional Municipality of Peel at various
    times, including fall 2003 when the appellant’s trial took place. The testimony
    was originally given during a wide-ranging inquiry in an unrelated proceeding
    conducted by a judge of the Superior Court of Justice sitting as a summary
    conviction appeal court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Present
    purposes do not command a forced march through the <i>minutiae</i> of the
    fresh evidence, nor a lecture to those in charge of courts administration
    about the deficiencies in the testing, assignment and supervision of court
    interpreters. No such issues are ripe for determination on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    interpreter assistance is required in a criminal trial, interpreter coordinators
    are to assign an accredited interpreter to the task. Unaccredited interpreters
    may only be used in situations of extreme urgency. Where an accredited interpreter
    cannot be found, the coordinator must notify the prosecutor, defence counsel
    and presiding judge of this unavailability. Extreme urgency refers to last
    minute calls. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diana
    Zywulko, the Polish interpreter provided by the interpreter coordinator in
    this case, was not an accredited interpreter. She failed Ministry testing
    twice and withdrew from the testing on a third occasion. She failed the memory
    section (in English), hence her performance in Polish was not evaluated. </p>

    Masrour was the interpreter coordinator who assigned Diana Zywulko to the
    appellant’s trial. Ms. Masrour was well aware that Ms. Zywulko was not an
    accredited interpreter. Far from advising the trial judge of Ms. Zywulko’s
    lack of accreditation, as was her duty, Ms. Masrour conveyed the impression
    to the trial judge that Ms. Zywulko was in fact properly accredited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Forouz
    Masrour knew that Diana Zywulko had served as a court interpreter in Peel
    Region for many years. Ms. Masrour considered that Ms. Zywulko had a proven
    command of both English and Polish, despite her failures to achieve accreditation,
    deficiencies that Ms. Masrour assigned to health problems and nervousness
    about the manner in which the testing was conducted. Shamia Jhoofy, an accredited
    interpreter, described Diana Zywulko as
    “one of our best Polish interpreters”, despite her lack of accreditation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence lacks a nexus to the proceedings at the appellant’s trial,
    more particularly to his understanding of them. We lack an independent record
    of the interpreter’s words, thus the wherewithal to make an <i>ex post facto</i> evaluation
    of the accuracy of the interpretation provided. Did the appellant understand
    the interpreter?  Did the appellant seek the interpreter’s assistance about
    the evidence or other trial events?  How often?  About what?  Was there something
    about the interpreter’s version that the appellant did not understand?  Nothing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel made no objection to the manner of interpretation provided, nor did

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         The Complaint </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that, as a person who did not understand the language in which
    trial proceedings were conducted, he was guaranteed the assistance of an
    interpreter under s. 14 of the <i>Charter</i>. Despite some facility in the
    language of trial, the appellant was entitled to <i>all</i> the constitution
    guarantees: continuous, precise, impartial, competent and contemporaneous
    interpretation of the trial proceedings. And what happened here fell short
    of what the constitution demands and guarantees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    factors contributed to the constitutional default here. The trial judge’s
    instructions to the interpreter and appellant, essentially that they work
    out between them what was to be interpreted, meant that the interpretation
    lacked continuity, precision and contemporanity. No one inquired about the
    competence of the interpreter. In the result, an unaccredited and presumptively
    incompetent interpreter provided interpretation, doubtless equally flawed.
    The appearance of a fair trial was inevitably compromised giving rise to
    a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the <i>Charter</i> does <i>not</i> make fine distinctions
    among the myriad degrees of language deficiency. Once a deficit is made to
    appear in an accused’s understanding of the language of trial proceedings,
    that accused is entitled to his or her <i>full</i> constitutional entitlement.
    It is of no constitutional moment by how much the accused’s understanding
    misses the mark, only that it does.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    need for interpretation was plainly established here. The appellant was entitled
    to the full constitutional response, absent informed waiver, not half-measures.
    There was neither informed waiver, nor constitutional compliance. A new trial
    should follow. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>The Guarantee of Interpreter Assistance</h4>

page-break-after:avoid'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    constitutional guarantee invoked by the appellant, s. 14 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    is in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A party or witness in any proceedings who does
    not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted
    or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the language of s. 14 is unpacked, it reveals three elements:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>i.          <i>Standing</i>: “a party or witness
    in any proceedings”;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ii.         <i>Language deficiency</i>: “who does
    not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are con-ducted”;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>iii.       <i>Entitlement</i>:
    “the right to the assistance of an inter-preter”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    an accused in a criminal trial, the appellant has standing to invoke the
    entitlement, provided he can establish the necessary deficiency. The controversy
    here has to do with the scope of the entitlement in light of the extent of
    the appellant’s linguistic deficiency. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>The Purpose of the Guarantee</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proper approach to the interpretation of the right delineated in s. 14 is
    purposive. In the result, it is necessary first to specify the purpose underlying
    the provision: said differently, to delineate the nature of the interests
    it is meant to protect. <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i> (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d)

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    guarantee in s. 14 serves several important purposes. It ensures that a person
    charged with a crime hears the case against him or her, and is furnished

    substance of the guarantee in s. 14 ensures that a party has the same basic
    opportunity to understand and be understood as if she or he were conversant
    in the language of the proceedings. That said, the principle of linguistic
    understanding is <i>not </i>to be elevated to the point where those with

    judges are to approach questions of the need for an interpreter with a measure
    of sensitivity and understanding. Judges should not be too quick to draw
    adverse inferences where the claimant, such as an accused at a criminal trial,
    has some facility with the language of the proceedings. After all, some persons
    may be able to communicate in a language for general purposes but not have
    sufficient comprehension or fluency to face a trial with its onerous consequences

    if they were conversant in the language in which trial proceedings are being
    conducted. <i>Tran</i> at 246.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    the conditions precedent of the section are satisfied, the guarantee of s.
    14 to interpreter assistance is unqualified. In the result, an assessment
    of whether the right has been breached invites no consideration of actual
    prejudice as a result of the infringement. Denial of proper interpretation
    when the case is being advanced is inherently prejudicial. Proof of actual
    prejudice falls to be assessed and accommodated under the remedial provisions

    person entitled to claim interpreter assistance may waive the right conferred

    waiver must be clear and unequivocal, be made with full knowledge of both
    the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and the effect the waiver
    will have on those rights, and be made personally by the accused, if necessary

    party who claims an infringement of a <i>Charter</i> right or freedom must
    establish the infringement, along with entitlement to any consequential relief
    sought, on a balance of probabilities. Where the claim asserts an infringement
    of s. 14, it falls to the applicant to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities,
    not only that she or he needed interpreter assistance, and that the assistance
    received fell below the constitutionally guaranteed standard, but also that
    this shortfall occurred as the case was being advanced. <i>Tran</i> at 256.
    It is worth reminder that, despite the rigour of the constitutional standard

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>The Principles Applied</h4>

    facility, thus language deficiency, is variable. It necessarily follows that
    what may be required to remedy a language deficiency, to bring it up to a
    defined standard, will vary from one person to the next, whether accused
    or witness, likewise comprehension or expression.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    practical terms, the primary source of information about the existence, nature
    and extent of a language deficiency is the person who suffers it. As Leggatt
    L.J. observed in <i>R. v. Gedi</i>, [1997] E.W.J. No. 2959 (C.A.(Crim. Div.)),
    a case that involved provision of a stand-by interpreter when the appellant
    testified on his own behalf: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But in practice a defendant knows whether he is
    following a question put to him or needs assistance by way of translation
    before he can do so, and he certainly knows whether he is being able to express
    himself satisfactorily in the foreign language or whether he needs the help
    of an interpreter. In our judgment there was no objection that could usefully
    be made to the course that is commonly adopted and was adopted here.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><i>Gedi</i> at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is a fact of everyday life in the trial courts of this and other provinces
    that many persons charged with crime whose first language is not the language
    of trial do <i>not </i>require continuous interpretation of every syllable
    uttered during proceedings that affect their vital interests. Some require
    more than others to ensure that they have the same opportunity to understand
    and be understood as if they were conversant in the language used in the
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Tran</i> itself,
    the appellant neither spoke nor understood the language of trial. Despite
    instructions from the trial judge to fully translate his (the interpeter’s)
    testimony as he gave it, the interpreter answered all questions asked of
    him in English, and only summarized his evidence at the end of his examination-in-chief,
    and again at the end of cross-examination. An exchange between the interpreter
    and the trial judge was <i>not interpreted</i> <i>at all</i> to Tran. What
    was required to bring Tran’s language deficit up to the required level
    – to understand as if he were conversant in the language of trial – was vastly
    different from what the appellant asked for and required here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    falls to the appellant to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that
    the interpreter assistance provided here came up short of the constitutionally
    guaranteed benchmark. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    express invitation from the trial judge to alert him to any difficulties
    encountered by the appellant with the interpreter, or with the interpretation,
    the trial record is eerily silent, utterly barren of any suggestion of incompetence
    or other interpretation deficiency. To the contrary, when the interpreter
    issue was first bruited during pre-trial motions, the appellant supported
    the assignment of Ms. Zywulko as the interpreter, and sought assurances from
    the trial judge that she would remain throughout the trial. His request was
    honoured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    imposition of an onus on a party who advances constitutional infringement
    as the foundation for particular relief, here a new trial, carries with it
    the obligation to discharge the onus by some form of proof. Proof of infringement
    is a condition precedent to entitlement to a remedy. Said another way, the
    remedy is not for the asking, only upon the showing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s proof consists of fresh evidence culled from another and later
    proceeding. It shows that the interpreter supplied here was <i>not accredited</i> by
    the Ministry of the Attorney General (she failed the accreditation test twice
    and withdrew a third time). She was put forward by the interpreter coordinator,
    whether knowingly or unwittingly, as accredited. She had served as an interpreter
    in the courts in Peel Region for a decade. According to one accredited interpreter,
    Ms. Zywulko was one of the best interpreters available, accredited or not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is lacking in the appellant’s fresh evidence materials, is a nexus between
    the systemic and accreditation flaws identified in the materials filed, and
    the interpreter assistance provided in this case: no affidavit or other evidence
    from the appellant, none from trial counsel and deafening silence in the
    trial record. Something supportive of <i>this </i>claim of constitutional
    infringement is necessary, but lacking. <i>Pham</i> at para. 5-6; and <i>Mohammadi

    appellant urges a bright line rule that essentially proceeds from <i>any </i>showing
    of a need for interpreter assistance to provision of continuous, precise,
    impartial, competent and contemporaneous interpretation as the <i>only</i> means
    of ensuring that the language deficient have the same opportunity as those
    conversant in the language of trial. Such a rule would render the procedure
    followed here <i>per se</i> constitutionally flawed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, the teachings of <i>Tran</i> are that the interpretation
    provided must be <i>sufficient</i> to ensure that the language deficient
    have the same opportunity as the language proficient to understand and be
    understood in the proceedings. Some require more than others, as in <i>Tran</i>,
    to reach the required level of understanding. <i>Tran</i> recognizes allowable
    departures from its general, though not unremitting rule. <i>Tran</i> at
    250. This appellant had difficulty with certain words. He was offered and
    accepted a method of interpretation that serviced his language deficiency.
    He made no complaint about any inadequacies at trial and has introduced no
    evidence on appeal indicative of any deficits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is plain from what happened on the first day of pre-trial motions that the
    appellant fully understood the trial judge’s direction that he (the appellant)
    was to speak up or indicate to his counsel whenever something was said or
    done that he did not understand or wanted repeated. He made no such request
    either of his counsel or of the trial judge at any time during the several
    weeks of trial proceedings. Indeed, even with a transcript of trial proceedings
    available for painstaking review, the appellant offers nothing to ground
    his claim that he did not have the required understanding of the evidence
    adduced or proceedings conducted that he sought and to which he was constitutionally

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complaints advanced on appeal are essentially twofold. The trial judge erred
    in law by failing to instruct the jury expressly that Barnes in-dock identification
    was entitled to no weight (in satisfying the prosecutor’s burden) and was,
    in fact, exculpatory of the appellant. The trial judge was also wrong to
    instruct the jury that Barnes’ identification of the German Shepherd dog
    was either independent evidence of identification or, at the least, capable
    of supporting Barnes’ evidence identifying the appellant as the man with
    the dog.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that Barnes’ evidence reduces to an in-dock identification
    unsupported by any pre-trial identification procedures and at odds with vital
    features of the appellant’s physical appearance, including his height and
    hair length. These discrepancies leave Barnes’
    evidence as evidence of resemblance only, not identification, and the jurors
    should have been told to ignore this evidence, or to treat it as exculpatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the reference to the dog exacerbated the error about
    Barnes’ evidence. Barnes’ reference to the dog did not strengthen this identification;
    to the contrary, if anything, it weakened it, because Barnes’ assumed the

    His rendition eschewed non-essentials and offered jurors a balanced account,
    including the most important points developed in cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jurors at length about the eyewitness identification
    evidence of Lee Barnes. Among other things, he pointed out:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>i           the need to be very cautious about
    relying on eyewitness testimony to find guilt;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ii          the link between wrongful convictions
    and eyewitness identification evidence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>iii        the absence of any real reason for Barnes
    to recall the incident, essentially an observation of a man walking a dog;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>iv         the absence of any meaningful detail
    in Barnes’ description of the man walking the dog;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>v          the inconsistency between Barnes’
    description of the man’s hair length and the appearance of the appellant
    a short time later at a nearby ATM, as revealed by a photograph filed as
    an exhibit; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>vi         the absence of any real evidentiary
    value from the in-dock identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in his final instructions, the trial judge discussed the defence position
    in connection with the evidence of Lee Barnes:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            He asks you to look closely at the
    evidence of Lee Barnes – there are problems, inherent problems because of
    the in-dock identification which the defence suggests is really worthless
    and would only amount to anything if you were satisfied of the certainty
    of the underlying circumstances of that identification. He points out that
    those circumstances should make you shudder – although he did not use those
    words, but that is what he meant I would think – that those circumstances
    are such that you should conclude that his evidence is unreliable because
    of the discrepancies in the testimony. He points out that Rybak does not
    have shoulder-length dark hair. There is no description of his face or clothing
    that is worth any weight at all. There is absolutely no description of the
    face of the person. He asks ‘Why didn’t the police assemble a photo line-up?’ – put
    a dozen photographs together of individuals having some features like Mr.
    Rybak and put those 12 together and see if this witness could pick out Rybak
    as the person he saw walking the dog at the material time. Mr. Goldman called
    this a ‘shocking failure’ by the police. He says that Barnes’
    observation of the man likely occurred at 1:30 a.m., and of course at that
    time you know that he was at the ATM machine. He tells you that there was
    no mention of the

    circumstances of the in-dock identification of the appellant in this case
    obligated the trial judge to strongly caution the jurors about the dangers
    inherent in this superficially cogent evidence. As Arbour J. pointed out
    in <i>R. v. Hibbert </i>(2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think it is important to remember that the danger
    associated with eyewitness in-court identification is that it is deceptively
    credible, largely because it is honest and sincere. The dramatic impact of
    the identification taking place in court, before the jury, can aggravate
    the distorted value that the jury may place on it. I am not persuaded that
    the instruction quoted above, to the effect that such identification should
    be accorded “little weight”, goes far enough to displace the danger that
    the jury could still give it weight that it does not deserve.</p>

    this case, as part of his instructions about the frailties of eye witness

    identification of the appellant:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is true the identification in court, ‘Oh, that’s
    the man’, that really is not what we are looking at. When he says ‘Well that’s
    the man. That’s the man I saw’ I would not pay too much attention to that.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    adequacy of instructions to alert jurors to the frailties associated with
    evidence of an in-dock identification will depend on the circumstances revealed
    in individual cases. What is adequate to the task in one instance may well
    be deficient in another. </p>

    of Barnes’ testimony that it was the appellant he saw with the German Shepherd
    dog late in the evening of October 28, 2000, or early the following morning,
    provides a circumstantial link between the appellant and the deceased’s apartment,
    as well her car. The appellant acknowledged in his police interview that
    he had been with the deceased at the apartment until late in the evening
    of October 28, 2000. He was at a nearby bank machine early the following

    The trial judge’s instructions on Barnes’
    evidence tracked clearly the appellant’s position about the grounds upon
    which this evidence was unreliable and should be rejected by the jury.</p>

      for, among other things, unlawful arrest. The Superior Court dismissed
      the petition. The Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed. Critical to the appellant’s
      claim for damages was a submission that the trial judge had misapprehended
      certain evidence given at trial, in effect considering it evidence of identification
      (thereby justifying the appellant’s arrest) when it was exculpatory because
      it included a feature, grey hair, that was dissimilar to the appellant’s
      appearance. For the majority, Pigeon J. said at 52:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    several correct statements of the mental or fault element contained in the
    definition of murder for which s. 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides,
    the trial judge on one occasion said what follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Under the second branch of the definition of murder
    the essential mental element is an intention to cause bodily harm of such
    a grievous and serious nature that the defendant knew it was likely to cause
    death, coupled with recklessness as to its consequences. In this context
    recklessness involves awareness of the danger of the consequences from prohibited
    conduct, but a persistence nonetheless with knowledge of the risk. Recklessness
    is the attitude of one who was aware of the danger that the prohibited conduct
    could bring but nevertheless persisted in the conduct despite knowledge of
    the risk. Recklessness is the attitude of one who simply does not care. He
    knows the risk of carrying on with the prohibited conduct but is indifferent
    to the consequences – he simply does not care. In order to find the accused
    guilty of murder you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he
    had one of the two specified specific intents.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that it is not enough under s. 229(a)(ii) that an accused
    foresees simply a danger of death, rather she or he must foresee a likelihood
    that death will follow from the bodily harm that she or he is causing the
    victim. The instructions given, in the only extended discussion of the mental
    element in s. 229(a)(ii), left the jurors to determine guilt on a basis that
    was too expansive. An error of this kind warrants a new trial since the jurors
    may well have decided the appellant’s guilt on this erroneous basis.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the excerpted passage, the trial judge began his instructions with a reference
    to the mental element in s. 229(a)(ii). Apart from the compendious references
    to reck-lessness “as to its consequences”, rather than to the full statutory
    terms, “reckless whether death ensues or not”, the instruction is accurate.
    The phrase “its consequences”, which is repeated later as “the consequences”,
    refers grammatically to the consequences of the bodily harm earlier described
    as death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an attempt to help the jury to understand the notion of recklessness, the
    trial judge referred to an awareness of the <i>danger</i> of certain consequences
    following from the prohibited conduct. And it is in his description of the
    degree of foresight required that the trial judge slipped into error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.

      about eleven months after the trial judge had charged the jury in this
      case, this court held that it was not sufficient that an accused foresee
      simply a <i>danger</i> of death following from the bodily harm inflicted
      to satisfy the standard set by s. 229(a)(ii). An accused must foresee a <i>likelihood</i> of
      death ensuing from the bodily harm she or he has inflicted on the victim.
      The terms “danger” and
    “likelihood” reflect risks of different magnitudes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth reminder that in <i>Czibulka</i> the substitution of “danger” for “likelihood” was
    not the only error made in connection with the mental element in s. 229(a)(ii).
    The consequences of which foresight is required were described as “bodily
    harm”, rather than “bodily harm likely to cause death”, or, said another
    way, the likelihood of death as a consequence of the bodily harm. The flawed
    instructions in <i>Czibulka</i> were repeated, along with the correct instructions,
    in response to a question by the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Czibulka</i> court
    found it unnecessary to decide whether the errors made in explaining the
    mental element in s. 229(a)(ii) to the jury in that case were sufficiently
    serious to warrant a new trial. </p>

      provided an erroneous definition of recklessness when instructing jurors
      on the mental element in murder under s. 229(a)(ii). This court assessed
      the error in the context of the entire instructions on the mental element
      in murder. There, as here, the trial judge had correctly recited the mental
      element for murder several times, both before and after the mis-direction.
      The court rejected the complaint of prejudicial misdirection. See also, <i>R.

    instructions. In passages both before and after the admitted misdirection
    on the meaning of “reckless” in s. 229(a)(ii), the trial judge repeatedly
    and unerringly recited the mental element required to establish murder under
    the subparagraph. The jurors asked no questions about this subject. Defence

    instruction seems beyond controversy. But absence of this further instruction
    can scarcely be characterized as an omission prejudicial to the appellant.
    After all, the appellant’s explanations for the conduct were left to the
    jury and the claim of an alternative explanation, impaired driving, had nothing
    to do with any post-offence conduct except the lie about the mystery driver,

    trial judge instructed the jury on intoxication. According to the appellant,
    the instructions given contained two serious flaws: failure to relate the
    evidence of intoxication to proof of the mental element required to make
    an unlawful killing murder, and treatment of intoxication as a discrete defence,
    rather than as a factor relating to the adequacy of the prosecution’s proof
    of the mental element required to make an unlawful killing murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did <i>not</i> expressly advance the intoxication issue at trial
    since it was incompatible with the denial of complicity urged by trial counsel
    on his behalf. That said, the trial judge was required to instruct on the
    issue because the appellant’s statement about alcohol consumption on the
    night of October 28, 2000, coupled with the toxicological evidence extrapolating
    back from later blood alcohol concentrations, provided an air of reality
    to the issue. </p>

    allegations of error the appellant now advances are threefold. The trial
    judge denigrated the importance of intoxication by telling the jury that
    the appellant had not raised the issue and did not rely upon it. The trial
    judge treated intoxication as a separate defence, rather than simply relating
    it and the supportive evidence to the essential mental element in murder.
    And the trial judge undermined the effect of the toxicological evidence of
    Dr. Langille by characterizing it as unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    position advanced by defence counsel at trial was a denial of participation
    in the unlawful killing of the deceased. When the appellant left their apartment,
    the deceased was alive and well. The couple had not quarrelled. The appellant
    was going out with some friends. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    of self-induced intoxication, more particularly the effects of self-induced
    intoxication on the mental processes of one charged with murder, is relevant
    for the trier of fact to consider, along with other evidence, in deciding
    whether an accused had either mental state required by s. 229(a) to make
    that person’s unlawful killing of another murder. The “defence” of intoxication,
    as it is usually designated, is generally advanced by those who acknowledge
    an unlawful killing. It is not compatible with a denial of participation: “I
    am not the man.”  Defence counsel do not address juries with an argument “I
    didn’t do it, but I was drunk.”  </p>

    obligation to submit the issue to the jury for its determination, the position
    of defence counsel notwithstanding. <i>R. v. Cinous</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C.

    ), defence counsel did not want the trial judge to instruct on provocation
    because counsel was of the view that to do so would undermine the justification
    of self-defence that was being expressly advanced at trial. The trial judge
    left provocation to the jury despite defence counsel’s objection. The jury
    convicted of murder. Weiler J.A. offered this advice to trial judges confronted
    with the tension between their obligations to instruct on issues about which
    there is an air of reality and the incompatibility of those issues with the
    defence advanced by counsel at trial:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge charged the jury on provocation.
    On the appellant’s evidence that Mr. George became belligerent, attacked
    him, knocking him over the table, and then attacked him with a knife while
    he was attempting to fix it, there was some basis in the evidence for the
    defence to be left to the jury.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A trial judge is required to leave every defence
    to the jury for which there is an air of reality on the evidence. In his
    instructions, it would have been highly preferable for the trial judge to
    explain to the jury that provocation was not a position being advanced by
    the defence but one about which he felt he was required to charge them. …</p>

    He gave evidence about a print he found on a silver plate that he had placed
    on the deceased’s body. In the result, for reasons he explained, Sneddon
    concluded that the print had been placed there by a direct touch by someone

    strangled. Sneddon demonstrated the orientation of the print to the jury
    to support his conclusion. Despite the absence of any objection to Sneddon’s

    on the deceased’s skin, rather than a direct touch on the surface of the
    plate itself. That said, he was not entitled to say or show anything about
    body or hand position and its compatibility or otherwise with a hand on the
    neck or throat of the deceased in a strangulation attempt. And besides, the

    gain from the demonstration exceeds any risks inherent in it. <i>R. v. Watson</i> (1996),

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    demonstration here was uncomplicated. It did not require any lengthy hypo-thetical

    was right to permit it without objection, and did not misstate its relevance

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>3.         The Admissibility of the Appellant’s
    Videotaped Statement</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>                                    Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police
    arrested the appellant for the murder of Eva Papousek shortly before 1:00
    p.m. on October 29, 2000, immediately advised him of his <i>Charter</i> rights,
    and then administered the primary and secondary cautions, which informed
    him of his right to remain silent. The appellant exercised his right to counsel,
    first speaking to duty counsel and then, at his request, to a criminal lawyer
    who spoke Polish. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Investigators
    transported the appellant by police cruiser from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie, where he had been arrested, to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga, where he would be questioned. The interview, which lasted about
    seven hours, was videotaped in its entirety and transcribed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant challenged the admissibility of the videotaped interview
    on voluntariness and constitutional grounds. At the conclusion of the <i>voir
    dire</i>, the trial judge was satisfied that what the appellant said was,
    at once, voluntary and untainted by any infringement of the right to counsel
    or the right to silence. He admitted the record of the interview, subject
    to editing.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Complaint</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the trial judge erred in admitting the videotaped record
    of interview. The length of the interview, seven hours, as well the appellant’s
    steadfast assertion of the right to silence, commanded close judicial scrutiny
    of the admissibility issue, indeed provided strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence
    that the statement was not the product of the appellant’s free choice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the appellant sees it, the trial judge failed to appreciate that the appellant’s
    response to some police questions afforded no evidence that the answers given
    to others (or all) were the product of an informed choice to speak. Continued
    police questioning in the face of assertions of the right to silence compromises
    voluntariness and the right to silence itself. Further, police repeatedly
    told the appellant that, if he didn’t provide a statement to them, his silence
    would be turned against him in later proceedings. This incorrect statement
    of the law undermined the advice the appellant had received from counsel,
    and further compromised the appellant’s ability to make an informed decision
    about whether to speak or to remain silent. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge concluded that police conduct did not compromise
    the appellant’s right of choice. Investigators repeatedly told the appellant
    that it was <i>his</i> choice whether to speak with them, and nothing the
    questioners did or said could take away from that statement. Nowhere did
    any officer tell the appellant that his (the appellant’s) silence could be
    used against him. Any implicit message to a similar effect did not compromise
    the appellant’s freedom to choose. The common law recognizes an individual’s
    right to remain silent, but the right to remain silent does not include or
    extend to the right not to be spoken to by state authorities. <i>R. v. Singh</i> (2007),
    SCC 48 at para. 39. Likewise, the right to silence contained within the s.
    7 <i>Charter</i> guarantee does not prohibit police from questioning a detainee.
    Police persuasion, which falls short of denying the detainee the right to
    choose or of depriving him or her of an operating mind, does not breach the
    right to silence. <i>Singh</i> at para. 46; and <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990]
    2 S.C.R. 151 at 184.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    lengthy interview, coupled with repeated refusals to answer some questions
    without first speaking to a lawyer, mandate close judicial scrutiny of the
    admissibility of the record of interview. <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Roy </i>(2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 298, 303-4 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). In the end, what must be decided is whether the conduct of the state authorities
    denied the appellant the right to choose speech or silence, or deprived him
    of an operating mind. <i>Hebert</i> at 184; <i>Singh</i> at para. 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, defence counsel expressly disavowed any challenge to admissibility
    grounded on the absence of an operating mind. The trial judge, in a fact-specific
    application of the correct legal test, concluded that the appellant freely
    chose those questions he would answer, and those queries he would deflect.
    This finding of voluntariness extinguishes the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> claim
    as well. <i>Singh</i> at para. 37.</p>
