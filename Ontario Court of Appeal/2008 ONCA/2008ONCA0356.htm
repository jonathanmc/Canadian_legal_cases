        Statement made by Anne Tilly</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge admitted into evidence the utterance of a deceased witness, Anne
    Tilly, overheard by another witness, who stated
    “Willie” and “Willie, no” as the violent incident that led to the victim’s
    death unfolded. The basis upon which the trial judge admitted this evidence
    is not entirely clear, but on balance, it appears to us that the trial judge
    appears to have admitted the statement for the limited purpose of showing
    that it was made.  The import of this statement was unclear.  It could have
    indicated that the appellant, known as “Willie”, was the aggressor, or it
    could have indicated that Tilly was concerned that the victim was getting
    the better of the appellant.  Defence counsel elicited from the witness who
    heard the statement that he interpreted it to mean the latter and the defence
    relied on that evidence in closing submissions.  Crown counsel linked this
    evidence to other evidence heard very shortly thereafter from another witness
    who heard Tilly make similar utterances at a point where the appellant was
    clearly the aggressor.  The trial judge made no reference to the evidence
    in his instructions to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in admitting this evidence.
    Moreover, given the dynamic of the trial, and given the manner it which it
    was used by both sides, we are not persuaded that it could have caused the
    appellant any significant prejudice. Accordingly, we would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>2) Post-offence conduct</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the jury a brief but correct instruction on the use of certain
    post-offence conduct, namely, the appellant’s statement to the police that
    the blood on his clothing could have been ketchup.
     The appellant submits that a more detailed instruction was called for, directing
    the jury more specifically to the issues to which the post-offence conduct
    was relevant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, and as the trial judge observed, such an instruction almost certainly
    would have done more harm than good.  The post-offence conduct was relevant
    to the issues of self-defence and the appellant’s mental capacity and state
    of mind and a more specific instruction directing the jury along those lines
    would not have benefited the appellant in the context of this trial. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge erred by providing the jury with written
    materials consisting of an outline of the headings in the charge, the relevant
    sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, including the sections relating to
    the offences charged and the defences of self-defence and provocation, and
    a decision tree.  The appellant submits that because there were brief notations
    regarding the mental element required to prove manslaughter and murder, and
    no notations regarding self-defence and provocation, these materials created
    an “imbalance”.  We do not agree that any imbalance was created in this case.  While
    trial judges must exercise caution when providing written materials, there
    is no suggestion that these written materials contained any error or that
    they were unbalanced in the sense of favouring the Crown. We do not accept
    the submission that the trial judge was required to provide the jury with
    his entire charge on all relevant defences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the answers given by the trial judge to the jury’s questions were
    entirely accurate and satisfactory.</p>

style='font-weight:normal'>4) Sentence appeal</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error of principle that would justify this court in interfering with
    the 13 year period of parole ineligibility.  The jury was divided on the
    question, but 6 members favoured a significant increase to the 10 year mandatory
    period.  The trial judge’s reasons reflect a careful assessment of the circumstances
    of the offender and the offence.  We do not accept the argument that he placed
    undue weight on what he perceived to be the appellant’s lack of remorse.  The
    trial judge was present when the appellant stated that he was sorry for what
    had happened and it was for the trial judge to assess that statement.  In
    any event, as we read his reasons for sentence, the trial judge placed relatively
    limited weight on lack of remorse and we are not persuaded that he used it
    as an aggravating factor when imposing the 13 year period of parole ineligibility.</p>
