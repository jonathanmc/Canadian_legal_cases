    who fails to comply with the order, the publication in any document or
    the broadcasting or transmission in any way of information that could
    identify a victim, witness or justice system participant whose identity

    the able argument of Mr. Dineen as duty counsel, we dismiss the appeal against
    conviction and sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certain
    portions of the cross-examination of the appellant were arguably improper.  However,
    no objection was taken to those passages by trial counsel and no reference
    was made to those passages by the trial judge in her reasons for judgment
    which provided detailed grounds unrelated to the contested portions of the
    cross-examination, for rejecting the appellants evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    in isolation, the following passage in the trial judges reasons could be
    taken to suggest that she improperly attributed a motive to lie to the appellant
    when assessing his credibility.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is common
    sense, I think, that facing a serious charge an accused whether guilty or
    innocent would be tempted to lie if he or she thought that lies could exculpate
    them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Comments such as these should be avoided.  However, this passage must be read
    in context and, as we read her reasons as a whole, the trial judge had already
    rejected, on amply explained grounds, the appellants evidence. This passage
    must be read in that light.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court held in <i>R. v. S.V</i>., [2007] O.N.C.A. 243 at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Thus, having
    found for valid reasons that an accuseds version of events is incredible,
    it is not inappropriate for the trier of fact to make the common sense observation
    that the reason the accused has not been truthful with the court is that
    he or she does not wish to be convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the sentence appeal, again there were passages in the trial judges reasons
    that are problematic.  The trial judge described as aggravating factors that
    the complainant had been compelled to testify and that she had been disbelieved
    by her mother when she made her allegations of abuse.  These were not aggravating
    factors, but they do bear upon the serious consequence of the offence on
    the complainant.  In any event, even if the description of the aggravating
    factors amounts to an error, we are not persuaded that the sentence of two
    years less a day was not a fit sentence given the serious nature of this
    crime which involved a sexual assault upon a young family member by a close
    relative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Accordingly,
    the appeal against conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal sentence is
    granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
