    is a Crown appeal from the sentence imposed on the respondent, M.O., following
    a guilty plea. The circumstances giving rise to it are atypical. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence hearing in this case lasted the better part of five years. The first
    four-and-a-half years were taken up with a dangerous offender application.  The
    offences underlying that application (the predicate offences) consisted of
    one count of breaking, entering and committing an assault with a weapon,
    one count of forcible confinement, and two counts of threatening to cause
    death. The respondent pleaded guilty to the predicate offences on January
    22, 2001. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dangerous offender application was eventually terminated by the trial judge
    in a ruling dated June 17, 2005. A conventional sentence hearing ensued and
    on November 17, 2005, the trial judge determined that a 15-year global sentence
    for the predicate offences was appropriate. Taking into account the time
    spent by the respondent in pre-trial custody, which the trial judge calculated
    on a two-for-one basis as twelve-and-a-half years, he sentenced the respondent
    to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. The Crown appeals from this sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown raises several issues on appeal. First, it submits that the trial judge
    erred in terminating the dangerous offender application. If correct in that
    submission, the Crown further submits that this court should declare the
    respondent a dangerous offender and impose an indeterminate sentence having
    regard to the completeness of the record, the procedural rights afforded
    to the respondent, the jeopardy he was facing both during and after the dangerous
    offender application, and the findings of fact made by the trial judge on
    sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    the Crown submits that if this court accepts that the trial judge erred,
    but is not prepared to declare the respondent a dangerous offender, we should
    allow the appeal and order a new dangerous offender proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a final alternative, the Crown submits that if we conclude that the trial
    judge did not err in terminating the dangerous offender application, we should
    nonetheless allow the appeal and increase the respondent’s sentence from
    two-and-a-half years to six years because of a calculation error made by
    the trial judge in assessing the credit for pre-trial custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, who appeared in person, submits that the appeal should be dismissed
    in its entirety. Alternatively, he submits that if the trial judge erred
    in terminating the dangerous offender application, we should allow the appeal
    and order a new dangerous offender proceeding. He also suggests that if we
    are concerned about his imminent release into the community on parole, we
    should marginally increase his sentence to ensure that he remains in custody
    pending the outcome of that proceeding. This proposal, though presumably
    made in good faith, is legally untenable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the respondent was unrepresented on the appeal, Mr. Philip Downes appeared
    as <i>amicus curiae</i> and provided helpful submissions to the Court, for
    which we are grateful. Mr. Downes submitted that the appeal should be dismissed
    in its entirety. Alternatively, he argued that if we allow the appeal on
    the basis that the trial judge erred in terminating the dangerous offender
    application, we should uphold the existing custodial sentence, find the respondent
    to be a long-term offender, and order that he be supervised in the community
    upon his release for a period of ten years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, we are respectfully of the view that the trial judge
    erred in terminating the dangerous offender application. We are further of
    the view that the record amply supports a finding that the respondent is
    a dangerous offender and that there are no due process concerns that would
    cause us to forego making that finding and instead order a new dangerous
    offender hearing.  We are also satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility
    of a different outcome if a new dangerous offender hearing were to be ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed by the trial judge,
    declare the respondent to be a dangerous offender and impose a sentence of
    detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period.</p>

      a borderline personality disorder and an alcohol abuse disorder. His condition
      and the disorders that underlie it are longstanding and deeply ingrained. </span></p>

      his first wife, and ending in November 1997 when he was arrested and detained

      physically abused, sexually assaulted and psychologically tormented virtually
      every woman with whom he has formed a relationship. The record before us

      this period, the respondent has amassed a substantial criminal record consisting
      of 44 prior convictions, 18 of which involve offences of violence and nine
      of which involve breaches of court orders. The violent offences are almost
      entirely directed at women. They include such serious crimes as attempted
      rape, choking, sexual assault, threatening death, and assault causing bodily
      harm. The breach offences consist of breaches of bail and probation orders.
      Many of these offences involve breaches of non-association conditions designed
      to protect the affected women, as well as breaches of conditions intended
      to promote the respondent’s rehabilitation and prevent him from committing
      further crimes. </span></p>

      litany of violent episodes reported by the women whom the respondent has
      victimized over the years is discussed thoroughly in the trial judge’s
      reasons for sentence. These reasons attest, in graphic terms, to the respondent’s
      propensity for violence and his need to dominate, control, humiliate and
      in some instances, terrorize the women with whom he has formed relationships.
      With one exception, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the women
      who testified about the respondent’s violent and abusive conduct and he
      rejected the respondent’s denials or watered-down version of these events.
      He found a picture of “one almost unbroken chain of drunken, psychological,
      physical and sexual abuse” of women that “has continued for almost thirty
      years” and that only “truly stopped when [the respondent] was in prison.”  </span></p>

      she was planning to marry another man and that there was no possibility

    M.T. to him. As noted by the trial judge, M.T. “was a woman in her 30s who
    was seeking therapeutic help to assist her in dealing with problems of childhood

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge provided extensive reasons for excluding Dr. Fleming’s assessment
      report from the dangerous offender proceeding. Three principal grounds
      for his decision to exclude the report can be discerned from his reasons:
      (1) the power imbalance between the state and the respondent; (2) the lack
      of independence of the s. 752.1 report; and (3) prejudice to the respondent
      from the late disclosure of the material used to prepare the report.  We
      now summarize and analyze the trial judge’s reasons on each of these three
      grounds. </span></p>

      excluding the assessment report, the trial judge placed considerable emphasis
      on “the context of this application” and the “enormous imbalance of power” that
    “infects every level and nuance of a dangerous offender proceeding.” Accepting </span><i>amicus</i>’ description
    of dangerous offender proceedings as “Canada’s answer to capital punishment”,
    the trial judge compared and contrasted the respondent’s unenviable position – in
    custody and impecunious – to that of “the state’s officers”, who are “all
    at liberty”
    and who “enjoy unlimited resources with which to prosecute the application.”</p>

    this vein, the trial judge outlined in considerable detail the difficulties
    faced by the respondent in trying to defend himself from a jail cell, hampered
    by a lack of resources and an inability to access the voluminous material
    that the Crown had amassed against him. He also outlined some of the steps
    he personally had taken to assist the respondent, including arranging for
    a special holding cell at the courthouse where the respondent could review
    the material and prepare his defence.</p>

    concluding this part of his reasons, the trial judge candidly acknowledged
    that “[l]ittle of the information … just reported” had been filed before
    him on the application. Rather, it was the product of the trial judge’s own
    observations over the four-and-a-half years during which the respondent had

    the end, the trial judge concluded that the failings of the system were relevant
    to the application brought by <i>amicus</i> and the respondent to exclude
    Dr. Fleming’s assessment report. In his view, they were “<span lang=EN-US>important
    to the context of this application and in the evaluation of prejudice that
    can be sustained by an offender when he faces procedural injustice beyond

      the trial judge’s indictment of the dangerous offender regime is very much

      in commenting on the unfairness of this perceived power imbalance, the
      trial judge referred to the unlimited resources available to the Crown
      and made much of the fact that, in this case, the Crown conducted an extensive
      investigation and left no stone unturned. He observed at paras. 19-22:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>This enormous imbalance of power infects every level and nuance of
      a dangerous offender proceeding. In the prosecution of this one, the Crown
      has prepared informations for and been granted twenty-five general warrants.
      All were executed and resulted in voluminous data bearing on almost every
      aspect of Mr. O.’s life from elementary school forward. He is now 60 years
      of age. Only two warrants for which the Crown applied were refused.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>All of this voluminous material has been carefully organized and collated
      by the police and the Crown legal team. [In a footnote, the trial judge
      commented that when the voluminous material was sent to the Royal Ottawa
      Hospital for the respondent’s psychiatric assessment, it was “wholly <b><u>un</u></b>organized.”
    [Emphasis in original.]] </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Even in its organized form it represents a prodigious and intimidating
      body of potential evidence. The Crown has obtained, where possible, transcripts
      or documents of and from earlier proceedings involving Mr. O., including
      domestic and divorce proceedings in which he was involved.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I have not counted the witnesses who have testified but they are numerous,
      indeed. The witnesses include many so-called victims of Mr. O.’s alleged
      and proven past misconduct and representatives of almost every aspect of
      the federal and provincial correctional systems. If authorities have placed
      any budgetary restraints on the Crown in the prosecution of these proceedings,
      they are not apparent to me.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      fail to see why the Crown’s thoroughness should be held against it, let
      alone be used as a basis for rejecting Dr. Fleming’s assessment report.
      To suggest that it was somehow wrong or unfair for the Crown to ferret
      out every last bit of information pertinent to the respondent’s level of
      dangerousness is a remarkable proposition and one that we soundly reject.
      The Crown’s ability to uncover a large body of evidence unfavourable to
      the respondent speaks more to the respondent’s failings than to any unfairness
      on the Crown’s part. Moreover, the Crown cannot be criticized, and indeed
      should be commended, for adducing evidence to fully inform the trial judge
      of the relevant facets of the provincial and federal correctional systems,
      including programs available in prison and in the community that might
      be of assistance to the respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
      the bleak picture painted by the trial judge of the insurmountable obstacles
      that the respondent was forced to endure is largely overstated and in many
      respects unjustified.  For example, the trial judge stated at para. 25:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. O. while self represented at one point asked the court to order
      the Legal Aid system to provide him, not with counsel, but with some secretarial
      help and materials and some services of a private investigator. Alas, Legal
      Aid’s warrant is only to provide counsel, not any lesser or less expensive
      kind of help. Legal Aid may fund a private investigator but only if applied
      for by counsel and then approved. Without counsel, Mr. O.’s request was
      turned down. He was very much on his own.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      the extent that the respondent was “very much on his own”, he had only
      himself to blame. The criminal justice system cannot be faulted. It came
      to the respondent’s aid at every conceivable turn. The system provided
      the respondent with numerous lawyers both before and during the dangerous
      offender proceeding; the system offered the respondent a lawyer at the
      province’s expense; the system provided for and funded <i>amicus curiae</i>;
      the system enabled the respondent to obtain his own “defence”
    psychiatric assessment at the Royal Ottawa Hospital; and the system made
    special provision for the respondent so that he could review the Crown’s
    material and prepare for his defence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      short, if the respondent was disadvantaged, it was largely a function of
      his own making and not that of a power imbalance within the criminal justice
      system. For these reasons, we conclude that the trial judge erred in taking
      into account his concerns about an imbalance of power in deciding to exclude
      the s. 752.1 assessment report. </span></p>

      and Dr. Fleming and his staff at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre.  These
      findings paint the Crowns as acting in a high-handed fashion, with little
      or no regard for the rights or interests of the respondent. Indeed, the

      of February and March 2003, after the respondent had completed his extended
      stay at Penetanguishene.  As noted above, the additional material consisted
      primarily of written statements and audio recordings from a number of domestic

      to its position. According to the trial judge, the new information – which
      had actually been available for some time – was hurriedly gathered by Detective
      Knight in January 2003 because someone from Dr. Fleming’s office had tipped
      the Crown attorneys to a possible problem with Dr. Fleming’s assessment
      report. The trial judge stated at paras. 70-71 that he was:</span></p>

      the Crown that the report either might be unfavourable or, if favourable,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    as fair but suddenly became dreadfully skewed.” The trial judge found that
    Dr. Fleming and his staff “quite unwittingly … allowed themselves to become
    apparently co-opted by the Crown” and the Crown “made the error of treating
    the assessment report as a partisan medical.” Because of this, the trial
    judge was of the view that he could place “no confidence in the independence
    of the report.” Dr. Fleming’s disclaimer in the report that the

      of implicating these individuals in a conspiracy to mislead the court and
      potentially manipulate the course of justice. It follows, in our view,

      called to testify on the motion to exclude the report. However, evidence

      Knight explained that prior to 2003, she spent the majority of her time

      reaching the point where the Attorney General’s consent would soon be sought.
      It is not surprising that the Crown would want to know the extent of the

      in arriving at his finding of collaboration, the trial judge placed considerable
      emphasis on the tone and content of a series of e-mails between the Crown’s

      March 2003. The e-mails dealt primarily with the additional material the

      addition to being highly critical of the tone of the e-mails, the trial
      judge also objected to the content of an e-mail from the Crown, asking
      Dr. Fleming’s assistant whether Dr. Fleming would like to receive tapes
      and transcripts of interviews with the victims, in which the Crown noted
      that Detective Knight
    “finds the demeanor of the victims striking in how emotionally they react
    so many years later.”  In another e-mail from the Crown, reference is made
    to two audio-taped interviews between Detective Knight and the respondent
    which are said to “address his manner of addressing her and various other
    comments he makes to her.”  The trial judge found these references to be
    “a clear example of advocacy by police and Crown to the assessor”.  </span></p>

      There is nothing wrong with this. Neither the police nor the Crown told
      Dr. Fleming what he should find or what conclusions he should draw. Alerting

      Dr.&nbsp;Fleming’s assessment report. To the extent that the trial judge
      found otherwise, we believe that his analysis was skewed by his co-existent
      findings concerning the lack of independence that he concluded tainted
      Dr. Fleming’s assessment report. We have already addressed those findings

      at paras. 23-34, aff’d (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 130 (S.C.C.). As the Court
      of Appeal for British Columbia observed in <i>Mitchell</i>, to the extent

lang=EN-US>That is precisely what could have occurred here, had the respondent
      felt any prejudice from the disclosure of the additional material on March
      7, 2003. At that time, it will be recalled, the respondent was represented
      by counsel. And yet, apart from objecting to the Crown’s request for a
      one-week extension to file Dr. Fleming’s assessment report, not a word
      was said by counsel or by the respondent about any supposed prejudice.
      Rather, it was not until two years later, after virtually all of the evidence
      pertinent to the dangerous offender application had been heard, that <i>amicus </i>first
      informed the trial judge that he planned to bring a motion to exclude Dr.

      of such nature brought belatedly in the proceeding should be viewed with
      considerable skepticism. The respondent had two years within which to remedy
      the so-called prejudice arising from the additional material relied on
      by the Crown. Had he or his counsel been of the view that the new material
      unfairly undermined his defence assessment with Dr. Bradford or his s.
      752.1(1) assessment with Dr. Fleming, steps could have been taken to have
      him reassessed, if need be. Alternatively, or additionally, he could have
      responded to the new material at the hearing by cross-examining those complainants
      who testified and  providing his own version of events. Indeed, he did
      just that. What he failed to do, in all but one instance, was to persuade
      the trial judge that he was telling the truth. Hence, conducting additional
      assessments after permitting the respondent to review the new material
      would have accomplished nothing, apart from dragging out the proceeding

lang=EN-US>As for the respondent’s concession in January 2003 to extend the assessment
      period and his willingness to turn over his autobiography to Dr. Fleming,
      the prejudice found by the trial judge to arise from these matters is tied
      directly to the trial judge’s finding of collaboration and a lack of independence
      on the part of Dr. Fleming and his staff. Those findings having been rejected,
      it can hardly be maintained that the consent to an extension and the disclosure
      of the autobiography caused any prejudice to the respondent. In short,
      with the question of independence off the table, there is no basis for
      thinking that the respondent would not have consented to an extension or

      who performed psychological testing on the respondent in conjunction with

      the Crown to call evidence and show cause why a life sentence should even
      be considered; only then would he put the defence to its option of calling
      evidence. On July 22, 2005, after hearing the psychiatric evidence and
      receiving submissions from the Crown, the trial judge indicated that he

      suffered by the many women victimized by the respondent over a 30-year
      period. In all but one of the ten domestic relationships considered by

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      intractable. This gentleman’s history suggests that his alcohol abuse disorder

      for this individual, he will need to spend, in my opinion, extended periods
      of time in a community correctional facility, prior to any more autonomous
      release into the community. He will need to be very heavily resourced,
      should he return to the community. Given his history, if this individual
      is returned to community residency, as a Long-Term Offender, I frankly
      think that if he is properly managed, he will likely spend almost as much
      time incarcerated (on breaches of his LTO conditions) as he would were
      he to be found a Dangerous Offender. While I would support the notion that
      there may be a possibility of eventual control of the risk for this individual
      in the community, given his current age, I am not sure I could support
      the notion that there is a “reasonable” possibility of eventual control
      of the risk; this gentleman’s criminality has been fulminant over the course

      the respondent’s extremely high score on the
    “Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R)”. He observed that this measure “has
    proven to be a reliable predictor of recidivism.” He further stated that
    the psychopathy disorder from which the respondent suffers has “predictive

      have Little declared a dangerous offender. In allowing the appeal, Cronk
      J.A. made the following apposite comments at paras. 59-61 concerning the
      supervisory regime posited by Dr. Klassen and recommended by the trial
      judge:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    both s. 753.1(1)<i>(c)</i> of the <i>Code</i> and <i>Johnson</i> [<i>R. v.
    Johnson</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.)] envisage that where the
    determination that an offender’s risk may be safely controlled in the community
    rests, as it did here, on adequate community supervision, rather than treatment,
    the availability of the resources necessary to implement such supervision
    effectively cannot be uncertain.  To hold otherwise would be speculative,
    thereby preventing any reliable assurance that unreasonable risks to public
    safety can be avoided.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this case,…
    the record before the trial judge demonstrated that several of the key supervision
      conditions recommended by her are incapable of performance, as a result
      of the current law or the resourcing conditions applicable to long-term
      offenders…  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he supervision
    controls recommended by the trial judge were described by Dr. Klassen as “unusual”, “stringent”, “severe” and “strict
    and tight”.  I agree.  The recommended conditions called for almost twenty-four
    hour monitoring of Little in the community by officials expert in his type
    of disorders, coupled with Little’s residency in a controlled environment,
    for ten years.  Even if the resources necessary to create such a lengthy
    offender-specific form of community supervision existed, a conclusion that
    I have already indicated is not supported by the evidence in this case, the
    overall form of supervision proposed comes close to replicating in the community
    the form of monitoring and supervision that the state provides in custodial
    settings.  </p>

lang=EN-US>Cronk J.A. noted at para. 62 that where “restrictive provisions” of
      the type proposed by the trial judge “are necessary to control the risk
      of reoffending by an offender, and to thereby protect the public, the dangerous
      offender provisions of the <i>Code </i>are engaged.” She rejected the notion
      that “the long-term offender regime is intended to virtually replicate
      jail-like conditions in the community for offenders released from custody.”  Cronk
      J.A. concluded that the risk Little posed to public safety was too great
      to be left to the chance of the future availability of the resources needed
      to implement the many conditions of supervision proposed by the trial judge
      in that case.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In our view, Cronk J.A.’s observations apply with equal force to the
      situation at hand. These observations lead us to reject the submission
      made by <i>amicus</i> that the respondent should be found a long-term offender.
      Given that round-the-clock supervision of the respondent would be needed
      to control his risk of reoffending, and thereby protect the public, a long-term
      offender finding is not appropriate. Rather, the dangerous offender provisions
      of the<i> Code</i> are engaged.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>We are satisfied that this is a case in which a dangerous offender

      a further hearing. We come to this conclusion having regard to the record
      as a whole, the completeness of the discontinued dangerous offender proceeding
      and the ensuing sentence hearing, the procedural fairness accorded to the
      respondent and the strong findings of fact made by the trial judge on sentencing,
