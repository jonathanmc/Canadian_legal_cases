style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    appeals concern the question of whether the City of Toronto Economic Development
    Corporation (TEDCO) is subject to the provisions of the <i>Municipal Freedom
    of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56 (the
    Act).   Showline Limited made an access to information request for records
    of TEDCO concerning the “Mega Studio Project” in the Toronto Port Lands.  An
    adjudicator under the Act concluded that the access provisions of the Act
    apply because TEDCO is deemed to be part of the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto for the purposes of the Act. A majority of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court disagreed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    specific question before this court arises under s. 2(3) of the Act, which
    provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Every agency, board, commission, corporation or
    other body not mentioned in clause (b) of the definition of “institution” in
    subsection (1) or designated under clause (c) of the definition of “institution” in
    subsection (1) is deemed to be a part of the municipality for the purposes
    of this Act <i>if all of its members or officers are appointed or chosen
    by or under the authority of the council of the municipality</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    officers of TEDCO are appointed by the directors of TEDCO.  The directors
    of TEDCO are appointed by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto’s City Council.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    adjudicator concluded that the directors of TEDCO were “officers” of TEDCO
    within the meaning of s. 2(3) of the Act.  According to the adjudicator,
    this conclusion was sufficient to render TEDCO subject to the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    Divisional Court granted an order in the nature of <i>certiorari</i>, quashing
    the order of the adjudicator granting Showline access to TEDCO’s records.  </p>

  <p><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    City incorporated TEDCO under the <i>City of Toronto Act</i>, <i>1985</i>,
    S.O. 1985, Pr. 22, and the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. B.16 (the OBCA).  The City is the sole shareholder of TEDCO.  All members
    of TEDCO’s board of directors are appointed by City Council.  The directors
    elect or appoint the officers of TEDCO pursuant to s. 5.01 of TEDCO’s By-Law
    No. 1 (the bylaw).  TEDCO must have three officers consisting of a president
    and chief executive officer, a secretary and a director of land acquisitions.  The
    bylaw provides for additional officers, including vice-presidents and a comptroller.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TEDCO’s
    website describes its mandate as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>TEDCO was incorporated in 1986 to pursue industrial
    development, and to attract and retain jobs in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>TEDCO owns over 400 acres of land in the Port Lands
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto and leases properties to more than 75 businesses.  This area is designated
    as a Regeneration Area in the City’s new Official Plan and Central Waterfront
    Secondary Plan: Making Waves.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>TEDCO provides the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto with an ability to implement selected elements of its broader economic
    development strategy.  Through its “incubator”
    program, TEDCO continues to do its part to encourage new employment formation
    in key industries.  More significantly, TEDCO plays an important role in
    stimulating reinvestment in strategic lands and underutilized sites.  This
    includes the identification, acquisition, rehabilitation, and development
    of strategic lands and buildings to create “development-ready” sites, particularly
    as a catalyst for new employment-related investment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TEDCO’s
    website describes its objective as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>to work closely with its shareholder, the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, and strategic partners to aggressively and creatively pursue business
    and redevelopment opportunities, which will retain, expand and attract businesses.  TEDCO
    helps create and retain employment within the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto, while ensuring that its efforts are complementary to the City’s
    overall Economic Development Strategy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some
    time prior to mid-2004, TEDCO publicly disclosed that the Toronto Port Lands
    would soon be home to the Toronto Film Media Complex, described as a state-of-the-art,
    purpose-built sound stage.  TEDCO released a request for proposals (RFP)
    for the development of the film/media complex.  TEDCO’s RFP contained the
    following advice:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All correspondence, documentation and information
    provided to TEDCO by every proponent in connection with, or arising out of,
    this RFP, and the submission of any proposal, shall become the property of
    TEDCO.  As a result, such proposals and other documentation and information
    may be treated and subject to release in accordance with the relevant provisions
    of the <i>Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i> (“MFIPPA”)…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Showline
    did not make a proposal but it made a request for access to information under
    the Act concerning the operation and administration of TEDCO.  TEDCO refused
    the request on the basis that it was not subject to the Act because it operated
    at arm’s length from the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto and because its officers are not appointed by City Council.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Showline
    made a similar request for access to information to the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  According to the adjudicator, although the City adopted the same
    position as TEDCO in relation to any records in the possession of TEDCO,
    in a supplementary decision, it produced some relevant documents found in
    its own record-holdings.  No appeal was taken from the City’s supplementary
    decision </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Showline
    appealed TEDCO’s refusal and the City’s decision in regard to the documents
    in the possession of TEDCO to the Information and Privacy Commissioner.</p>
  <h2>The Adjudicator’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    adjudicator, Ms. Beverley Caddigan, decided that TEDCO’s directors were included
    within the term “officers” in s. 2(3) of the Act.  In coming to this decision,
    she cited the United Kingdom <i>Companies Act</i> <i>1985</i>, 1985, c. 6,<i> </i>under
    which, according to the adjudicator, the term “officer” is defined as including
    a corporate “director”.  She also referred to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario case law to the effect that an “officer” of a corporation for the

    addressed the phrase, “if all of its members or officers are appointed or
    chosen by or under the authority of the council of the municipality” in s.

    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority’s reasons state:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[16]     In making her ruling that the directors
    of TEDCO were ‘officers’ under subsection 2(3) of the Act, the adjudicator
    also relied on an extended definition of ‘officer’ in the U.K. <i>Companies
    Act 1985</i>; and on Ontario case law in the context of the examination for
    discovery of corporate ‘officers’, including ‘directors’, on behalf of corporations.
    With respect, the case law relating to the examination of ‘directors’ as ‘officers’ of
    a corporation and the importation of a foreign statutory definition without
    explanation of its relevance to TEDCO’s circumstances, do not support the
    conclusion drawn by the adjudicator from them. More significantly, she omitted
    any reference in her ruling to the pertinent definitions of ‘officer’ and ‘director’ in
    the OBCA under which TEDCO was incorporated and to which TEDCO remains subject…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17]     In our view, ‘directors’ are not ‘officers’
    of a corporation in the context of subsection 2(3) of the Act. In fact, none
      of the ‘officers’ of TEDCO is a director (see para. [3] above).  … With
      reference to TEDCO, the statutory definitions in the OBCA of ‘officer’ and ‘director’ should,
      in our view, be applied in determining the application of the Act to the
      corporation.  The terms director and officer are not ambiguous and have
      distinct meanings in general corporate law and in the OCBA … In the context
      of subsection 2(3) of the Act … [t]he word ‘officers’ is used in its plain
      and ordinary meaning in relation to corporations.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority further stated that the officers of TEDCO were not “appointed by
    or under the authority” of City Council.  According to the majority, because
    the officers were appointed by the board of directors of TEDCO pursuant to
    its constating documents and the OBCA, the officers were not “appointed by
    or under the authority” of City Council.</p>

    J., in dissent, disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the directors
    of TEDCO were not officers for the purpose of s. 2(3) of the <i>Act</i>.  While
    she accepted that, “there is clearly a difference between ‘directors’ and ‘officers’ under
    the OBCA, that alone is not determinative of the issue”.  According to the
    dissenting judge, a consideration of s. 2(3) “in the context of the Act as
    a whole” leads to a different result.  In essence, she agreed with the approach
    taken by the adjudicator.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    dissenting judge also reasoned that the officers of TEDCO are appointed by
    the directors under the authority of the City:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[41] City Council appoints all of the directors
    of TEDCO who, in turn, appoint the officers. One might reasonably interpret
    this to mean that officers are appointed by the directors under the authority
    conferred upon the directors by the City. In my view, there is no logical
    reason to differentiate between officers and directors in this context. To
    do so focuses on an individual’s title rather than his or her role within
    the corporation, and fails to measure the connection or proximity between
    the municipality and the corporation. A somewhat analogous situation was
    raised in <i>British Columbia Development Corp. v. British Columbia (Ombudsman)</i>,
    [1984] 2 S.C.R. 447 in which the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the
    Supreme Court of Canada held that a subsidiary company which was not itself
    an ‘authority’, but was the subsidiary of an ‘authority’ came within the
    jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. </p>

    (Minister of Finance)</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 403, La Forest J., dissenting
    on a different point, described the overarching purpose of access to information
    legislation at paras. 60 and 61:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As society has become more complex, governments
    have developed increasingly elaborate bureaucratic structures to deal with
    social problems. The more governmental power becomes diffused through administrative
    agencies, however, the less traditional forms of political accountability,
    such as elections and the principle of ministerial responsibility, are able
    to ensure that citizens retain effective control over those that govern them;
    see David J. Mullan, “Access to Information and Rule-Making”, in John D.
    McCamus, ed., <i>Freedom of Information: Canadian Perspectives</i> (1981),
    at p. 54.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The overarching purpose of access to information
    legislation, then, is to facilitate democracy. It does so in two related
    ways. It helps to ensure first, that citizens have the information required
    to participate meaningfully in the democratic process, and secondly, that
    politicians and bureaucrats remain accountable to the citizenry. As Professor
    Donald C. Rowat explains in his classic article, “How Much Administrative
    Secrecy?” (1965), 31

    one considers that the object or purpose of the Act is to provide a right
    of public access to information under the control of municipalities and related
    municipal institutions, it would appear reasonable to conclude that TEDCO
    should be subject to the Act.  However, the s. 2(1) definition of the institutions
    covered by the Act neither includes TEDCO in clause (b) nor designates it
    under clause (c).</p>

    my view, all of TEDCO’s officers are “appointed or chosen by or under the
    authority of the council of the municipality” within the meaning of s. 2(3)
    of the Act.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the ordinary meaning of the word
    “authority” supports this conclusion.  In the <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i> (2nd
    ed., 2004), the main definition of “authority” has two parts:  “(a) the power
    or right to enforce obedience. (b) delegated power.”  In my view, given the
    purpose of access to information legislation and the modern approach to statutory
    interpretation, it is preferable to read s. 2(3) in light of the second part
    of the definition, rather than imposing a restrictive interpretation that
    embraces only the first part.  A similar point emerges from the <i>New Shorter
    Oxford English Dictionary </i>(1993), which provides as one of its definitions
    of “authority”:  “Derived or delegated power”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for TEDCO cites <i>R. v. Audet </i>(1996), 135 D.L.R. (4th) 20 (S.C.C.) at
    38 as authority for the restrictive approach to interpreting the word “authority.”  In <i>Audet</i>,
    the Supreme Court was called upon to interpret the phrase “position of authority” in
    what was then s. 153(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
    which “prohibits every person who is in a position of trust or authority
    towards a young person … from engaging in any sexual activity … with that
    young person”:  see <i>Audet</i> at para. 1.  In examining the “ordinary
    meaning” of the word “authority”, the majority in <i>Audet</i> essentially
    adopted the first part of the definition discussed above.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, <i>Audet </i>is distinguishable from the case at bar.  It involved
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, not an access to information statute, and thus
    the interpretive context was very different.  Moreover, in <i>Audet</i>,
    the second part of the <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i> definition of
    “authority” ­– “delegated power” – had no possible application.  Therefore,
    the court in <i>Audet </i>was not called upon to interpret “authority” in
    a context that has any bearing on the present case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    beyond the ordinary meaning of the word
    “authority,” the language of s.&nbsp;2(3) is cast in broad terms which suggests
    that the legislature intended an examination of substance rather than a fixation
    on formal and technical appointment processes.  The provision uses both the
    words “chosen”
    and “appointed” and also contemplates processes that are effected both “<i>by </i>the
    authority” and “<i>under </i>the authority” of City Council.  In the face
    of this broad language, I question an approach that treats as decisive the
    mere fact that City Council has delegated direct appointment power to TEDCO’s
    board of directors. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    although City Council does not <i>directly</i> choose TEDCO’s officers and
    does not hold an official veto over that process, the City’s role as TEDCO’s
    sole shareholder provides a significant nexus between City Council’s authority
    and the officers of TEDCO.  TEDCO’s board of directors, whose members are
    appointed directly by City Council, is always subject to City Council’s removal
    power.  This power finds expression in s. 3.06 of TEDCO’s bylaw, which provides
    that City Council may “remove any director from office and … elect any person
    in his stead”.  Moreover, City Council also has the discretion, as sole shareholder
    of TEDCO, to unilaterally make “shareholder agreements” that control the
    powers of the directors.  Under s. 3.09 of the bylaw, all the powers of the
    board of directors are fully subject to shareholder agreements, including
    its power to appoint officers.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    a formal and technical interpretation of s. 2(3) runs contrary to the purpose
    of the Act.  We are dealing with a corporation whose sole shareholder is
    the City of Toronto, whose sole purpose is to advance the economic development
    of the City, and whose board of directors – at the time of the proceedings
    before the adjudicator – was populated by persons directly appointed by City
    Council, including the Mayor of Toronto (or his/her designate), the Chair
    of the City’s Economic Development and Parks Committee, two City Councillors,
    and the Commissioner of Economic Development, Culture and Tourism (or his/her
    designate).  In light of what La Forest J. observed in the above-cited passage
    from <i>Dagg</i>, it seems to me that TEDCO is just another example of a
    complex bureaucratic structure of public administration.  In my view, it
    is contrary to the purpose of the Act and access to information legislation
    in general to permit the City to evade its statutory duty to provide its
    residents with access to its information simply by delegating its powers
    to a board of directors over which it holds ultimate authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    find additional<i> </i>support for this conclusion in the reasons for judgment
    of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Rizzo</i>, where the court adopted a
    purposive interpretation of two sections of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1980, c. 137 (ESA).  In <i>Rizzo</i>, this court had concluded that
    employees who were terminated as a result of the bankruptcy of their employer
    were not entitled to benefits under the ESA because their employment had
    not been terminated by their employer.  Although this approach was consistent
    with the language and plain meaning of the provisions, Iacobucci J. found
    it incompatible with the ESA’s wider purpose (paras. 20 and 27):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>At the heart of this conflict is an
      issue of statutory interpretation. Consistent with the findings of the
      Court of Appeal, the plain meaning of the words of the provisions here
      in question appears to restrict the obligation to pay termination and severance
      pay to those employers who have actively terminated the employment of their
      employees. At first blush, bankruptcy does not fit comfortably into this
      interpretation. However, with respect, I believe this analysis is incomplete.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my opinion, the consequences or effects which
    result from the Court of Appeal's interpretation of ss. 40 and 40a of the
    ESA are incompatible with both the object of the Act and with the object
    of the termination and severance pay provisions themselves…</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the ordinary meaning of the word “authority,”
    the broad language of s. 2(3), the City’s status as TEDCO’s sole shareholder,
    and the purpose of the Act and access to information legislation in general,
    it would be wrong to exclude TEDCO from the Act’s reach merely because City
    Council has delegated direct appointment power to the board of directors. </p>

    view of my conclusion that all of TEDCO’s officers are “appointed or chosen
    by or under the authority” of City Council, it is unnecessary for me to decide
    whether or not the word “officers” in s. 2(3) embraces TEDCO’s directors.  However,
    I do observe that even if one concluded that the word “officers” includes
    TEDCO’s directors, such conclusion only goes so far.  There remain those
    officers who are not directors and who have not been directly appointed by
    City Council.  The above analysis of the phrase, “appointed or chosen by
    or under the authority of the council of the municipality” is still required
    in order for <i><u>all</u></i> “officers” of TEDCO to be included within
    the embrace of s.&nbsp;2(3) of the Act. </p>
