    Foods Limited (“Caneast”) manufactures pickles.  Lombard General Insurance
    Company of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    insures Caneast under an “all risks” insurance policy.  On August 14, 2003,
    due to a regional blackout, or power outage, that totally interrupted the
    supply of electricity to Caneast’s refrigeration and pickle processing equipment
    for twenty-seven hours, Caneast sustained substantial spoilage of a large
    quantity of pickles and cucumbers. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard refused to indemnify Caneast for its loss, relying on two exclusion
    clauses that precluded recovery because of “change of temperature” and “mechanical
    or electrical breakdown or derangement”.  On Caneast’s motion for summary
    judgment, the motion judge held that the exclusion clauses were not engaged. 
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lombard appeals on the narrow ground that the motion judge erred in his interpretation
    of the term “derangement”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    reviewing the reasons of the motion judge, it is helpful to set out the relevant
    provisions of the insurance policy:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.         PERILS INSURED</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This form insures against all risks of direct physical
    loss of or damage to the property insured except as herein excluded.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.         EXCLUSIONS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.  .  .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b. Perils Excluded</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This form does not insure against loss or damage <i>caused
      directly </i>or indirectly:                                                                                                                        .  .  .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4) by centrifugal force, <i>mechanical or electrical
      breakdown or derangement</i> in or on the premises, but this exclusion
      does not apply to loss or damage from any ensuing fire or “accident to
      an object” as defined and limited in Section 20.i. of this form;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5) by dampness or dryness of atmosphere, <i>changes
      of temperature</i>, freezing (except with respect to insured water pipes),
      heating, shrinkage, evaporation, loss of weight, leakage of contents, exposure
      to light, contamination, pollution, change in colour or texture or finish,
      rust or corrosion, marring, scratching or crushing, <i>but this exclusion
      does not apply to loss or damage caused directly by a peril insured and
      not otherwise excluded under this form</i>; [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>At trial, the section 7.b.(4)
    exclusion was referred to as the “Mechanical Breakdown Exclusion”.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the undisputed facts and setting out the relevant provisions of
    the insurance policy, the motion judge referred to the positions of the parties.  Although
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lombard conceded that Caneast’s claim came within section 6 of the policy
    and that the blackout was a cause of Caneast’s loss, its position was that
    an excluded peril – “mechanical or electrical breakdown or derangement” – was
    also a cause of the loss.  Accordingly,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard was not required to indemnify Caneast.  Caneast contended that the
    Mechanical Breakdown Exclusion had no application in the circumstances of
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge began by referring to two decisions of this court that considered
    coverage under all risk policies for losses sustained during the same blackout – <i>Fresh
    Taste Produce Ltd. v. Sovereign General Insurance Co.</i>, (2005), 27 C.C.L.I.
    (4th) 7 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>94325 Ontario Inc. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</i>(2006),
    81 O.R. (3d) 399 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurance policy in <i>Fresh Taste</i> included exclusions identical to those
    in this case.  The insured, a fresh fruit distributor, lost stored produce
    when its refrigeration stopped operating as a result of the blackout.  The
    motion judge in a brief endorsement granted the insurer’s motion for summary
    judgment on the ground that both exclusions applied.  An appeal to this court
    was dismissed.  In a brief oral endorsement, this court stated in para. 9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the question of whether the exculpatory clauses
    were clear and unambiguous, even if an argument can be made that an electrical
    derangement “in or on the premises” did not include a power failure from
    outside the premises, the language of the clause excluding changes in temperature,
    other than from perils named, is clear and unambiguous.  The clause is not
    concerned with how the change in temperature is caused nor does it distinguish
    between losses due to natural and unnatural causes as the appellant suggests.  Thus,
    we see no basis for interfering with the motion judge’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Commonwealth</i>,
    the blackout caused the loss of electric power at all of the plaintiff’s
    fourteen supermarkets, leading to loss of refrigeration which caused the
    spoilage of food.  The application judge held that the power outage was a
    direct and proximate cause of the spoilage, which she found was covered by
    the broad terms of the policy.  The policy contained a “changes of temperature”
    exclusion identical to the exclusion in this case.  The application judge
    held that the exclusion did not apply because of the exception within the
    section 7.b.(5) exclusion, which I have highlighted above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    dismissing the insurer’s appeal, in a brief endorsement, this court agreed
    with the application judge that the blackout was the proximate cause of the
    loss.  The court added at para. 3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The respondent’s stock would not have been discarded
    had the unusual and unexpected blackout not occurred.  “Proximate” does not
    mean “closest in time”; the blackout was an effective cause of the loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect to the “changes of temperature” exclusion, this court held at para.
    5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Third, the appellants rely on the prior decision
    of this court in <i>Fresh Taste Ltd. v. Sovereign General Insurance Co.</i>,
    [2005] O.J. 4076, 27 C.C.L.I. (4th) 7 (C.A.) where, pursuant to a policy
    containing somewhat similar wording, the court held that the exclusion clause
    applied.  In our opinion, the wording of the <i>Fresh Taste</i> policy is
    distinguishable from that in the present policy.  Under both policies, coverage
    is excluded if the change of temperature was a direct or indirect cause of
    the loss.  However, under the policy in the case before us, the exclusion
    is stated to not apply to “loss or damage caused directly by a peril otherwise
    insured and not otherwise excluded under this Section”.  The loss was caused
    by the power outage, “a peril otherwise insured”, which was not “otherwise
    excluded” under the Section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the <i>Commonwealth</i> case, counsel for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard conceded that she could not argue that the blackout was not the proximate
    cause of Caneast’s loss and that the “changes of temperature” exclusion applied.  As
    a result,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard relied on the Mechanical Breakdown Exclusion to deny coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether a breakdown had occurred in Caneast’s refrigeration system,
    the motion judge considered <i>Brown Fraser &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Indemnity Marine
    Assurance Co.</i> (1958), 16 D.L.R. (2d) 263 (B.C.C.A.), <i>Triple Five Corp.
    v. Simcoe &amp; Erie Group</i> (1994), 159 A.R. 1 (Q.B.), aff’d (1997), 196
    A.R. 29 (Alta. C.A.) and <i>607697 Ontario Ltd. v. Anglo Canada General Insurance
    Co.</i> (1989), 37 C.C.L.I. 302 (Ont. Dist. Ct.).  At para. 37, the motion
    judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view these cases support the conclusion that
    the phrase “mechanical or electrical breakdown” denotes a <i>failure in the
    operation of a piece of equipment due to some mechanical or electrical defect
    in some part or parts of the equipment</i>.  It follows that where a machine
    ceases to operate because of an interruption in its power supply due to a
    regional blackout on the electricity grid, a mechanical or electrical breakdown
    of the machine does not occur.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not accept
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard’s interpretation of “mechanical and electrical breakdown” for the
    following reasons:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    sense of the word “breakdown” proposed by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard ignores the examples in the New Oxford Dictionary on how the word
    is used:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Break down: (of a machine or motor vehicle) suddenly
    cease to function: <i>his van broke down</i>; (of a person) experience a
    sudden failure of function in the vehicle they are driving: <i>she broke
    down on the motorway</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The motion judge observed
    that both examples suggest that the motor vehicle ceased functioning because
    of some internal problem or defect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    meaning advanced by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard does not accord with the common understanding of “breakdown”.  In
    the motion judge’s view, a “breakdown” normally refers to a situation where
    some part of a machine has broken, thereby preventing the machine from operating.  He
    said that a machine does not “break” when its source of power is interrupted;
    although, the machine is operating because it has not its source of power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    case law strongly suggests that “breakdown” refers to an internal problem
    or defect in a machine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then turned to the other part of the Mechanical Breakdown Exclusion – “mechanical
    or electrical… derangement in or on the premises”, noting that “derangement” has
    received little judicial attention.  It was
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard’s position that if the power supply is functioning properly, no derangement
    is present; but if the power supply is not functioning properly, a derangement
    is present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge referred to <i>Cominco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</i> (1985),
    13 C.C.L.I. 51 (B.C. S.C.), in which “derangement” had been interpreted in
    a clause in an all risks policy providing coverage for “a derangement of
    any object”.  As part of the process of manufacturing area fertilizer, Cominco
    passed carbamate, a highly corrosive gas, through a condenser.  Over the
    course of a year, serious corrosion occurred in one of the internal plates
    of the condenser.  The trial judge, Lysyk J., held that a derangement of
    the condenser had occurred.  At paras. 20 and 29 of his reasons for judgment,
    he wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel could cite no case in which the term
    “derangement” had been judicially considered.  Counsel for Cominco relied
    on the ordinary dictionary meaning of the verb “derange” in the sense of “to
    disturb the normal state, working, or functions of” (Shorter Oxford English
    Dictionary, 3rd ed.) or “to disturb the operation or functioning of” (Websters
    Third New International Dictionary), with a corresponding meaning to be given “derangement”.  Counsel
    for Commonwealth did not take issue with a definition of the term along these
    lines.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have no difficulty reaching the conclusion that
    there was in fact a disturbance of the normal state, operation and functioning
    of the condenser.  Accordingly, I accept Cominco’s primary submission to
    the effect that there was a “derangement” of the condenser within the scope
    and meaning of paragraph (ii) of clause 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, at para. 39 the motion judge referred to the trial judgment in <i>Triple
    Five Corp.</i>,<i> supra</i>, in which the trial judge, Wilson J., wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I take comfort from the use of the word
    “derangement” in the exclusion clause I am considering.  The definition of
    it in standard texts on words and phrases judicially considered indicate
    that it is defined most often in terms of mental health, but the dictionary
    definitions are such that in my view they support the conclusion that the
    exclusion defined here is one which includes design error.  The word may
    connote either the act or the fact of being disordered or confused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <i>Fresh Taste</i>, <i>Commonwealth</i>, <i>Cominco</i>, and <i>Triple
    Five</i>, the motion judge concluded at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view these cases support the conclusion that
    the phrase “mechanical or electrical breakdown” denotes a failure in the
    operation of a piece of equipment <i>due to some mechanical or electrical

    Lombard limited her submissions to arguing that an electrical derangement
    had occurred when Caneast’s refrigeration equipment could not operate because
    the blackout deprived it of electricity.  She contended that the motion judge
    erred in failing to give “derangement” its plain and ordinary meaning and
    in failing to give proper weight to decisions that have considered similar
    losses arising from the same blackout.</p>

    Lombard argued that because there was an electrical disturbance of the normal
    state, operation or functioning of Caneast’s refrigeration and processing
    equipment, there was an “electrical derangement” on Caneast’s premises that
    engaged the exclusion.</p>

    Lombard suggests that <i>Fresh Taste</i> and <i>Commonwealth</i>, decisions
    of this court, support her position that the electric derangement exclusion
    applies.  She suggested that in <i>Fresh Taste</i>, the court “appears to
    have accepted” that the power failure was an electrical derangement by raising,
    without deciding, whether an electrical derangement “in or on the premises” included
    a power failure from outside the premises.  She further suggested that in <i>Commonwealth</i> this
    court “appears to have accepted” that but for the exception to the exclusion,
    the electrical derangement in or on the premises exclusion would apply to
    a loss of perishable food caused by a loss of power to the refrigeration
    equipment resulting from the blackout.</p>

    </i>, [2008] O.J. No. 1230 (S.C.J.), released about three weeks before this
    appeal was argued.  In <i>Deluca</i> the plaintiff, which operated a restaurant,
    sustained damages when its refrigeration did not function because of the
    blackout.  It sued its insurer, Lombard, for indemnity under an all risks
    policy that contained the identical mechanical derangement and change of
    temperature exclusions as the policy in this case. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard moved successfully to strike out the plaintiff’s claim on the ground
    that the exclusions precluded recovery.</p>

    motion judge, Patterson J., found that the blackout was the proximate cause
    of the plaintiff’s loss, and, therefore was covered by its all risks policy.  He
    also found that the all risks policy covered all of the losses claimed by
    the plaintiff.  The motion judge found that both the change of temperature
    and mechanical derangement exclusions applied.  He did not follow the trial
    judgment in this case.  Rather, he held at para. 35 that
    “the derangement exclusion will apply regardless of the cause, internal or
    external”.  He was also of the view that Brown J. misinterpreted <i>Cominco</i>. </p>

    for Caneast submitted that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard is wrong in its contention that an electrical derangement occurs
    when an electrically operated machine stops working because its source of
    electricity is cut off due to a blackout.  He argued that it is contrary
    to case law, as well as to common sense, to find that an electrically operated
    machine breaks down or becomes deranged because it stops working when there
    is no electricity.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge reached the correct result.  He applied the proper
    principles of interpreting an insurance contract in construing the Mechanical
    Breakdown Exclusion.  For the sake of completeness, I will briefly summarize
    these principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurance policy is a contract.  The ordinary rules applicable to the interpretation
    of contracts apply.  The wording of the insurance contract must be given
    its plain and ordinary meaning.  The insurer has received consideration for
    the coverage of stipulated risks.  The promised coverage creates reasonable
    expectations on the part of the insured.  If a loss falls within the ambit
    of the risks covered, the insurer must indemnify the insured for its loss,
    subject to the application of any exclusion clause.  Coverage clauses should
    be construed broadly and exclusion clauses, narrowly.  Since insurance policies
    are essentially adhesionary, the standard practice is to construe ambiguities
    against the insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge was correct in finding that Caneast’s loss was
    not caused directly or indirectly by “mechanical or electrical breakdown
    or derangement”.  I agree with his finding, based on the authorities to which
    he referred, that
    “breakdown” and “derangement” refer to an internal problem or defect in a
    machine, and not to the machine’s failure to operate due to an interruption
    to its power supply caused by a regional blackout.  Caneast’s refrigeration
    did not stop because of some internal defect; it stopped because the power
    to it was cut off.  Moreover, I agree with the motion judge that had
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard intended to exclude blackouts from the perils covered by the policy,
    it would have been a simple matter to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly observed that “mechanical or electrical derangement
    in or on the premises” has received little judicial consideration.  “Derangement” is
    an odd word to be used in an exclusion clause in an insurance policy.  It
    is generally used in respect to mental health and is synonymous for the impairment
    of bodily function.  This is confirmed by a Quicklaw search of about 500
    Canadian, American and English cases in which the word “derangement”
    is found.  In virtually all of the cases, the word was used in respect to
    mental health or bodily function.  Indeed, the only instances in which
    “deranged” is considered are those referred to in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    Caneast and Lombard relied on the same dictionary definition of “derange” – “to
    disturb the normal state, working, operation or functioning of.”  However,
    each party differed on the application of the definition to the power outage.  In
    essence,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard’s position was that there is a derangement if the power supply is
    not functioning properly.  This is probably correct, and accords with the
    definition of “derangement”.  However, that is not what happened here.  As
    the trial judge held, the electrical supply was not disturbed by the blackout.  There
    was no electrical supply to be disturbed; because of the blackout there was
    no electrical supply.  What happened was more than a disturbance of the electrical
    supply to Caneast’s refrigeration equipment.  There was no electrical supply,
    and, as a result, the refrigeration equipment failed to operate.  It follows
    that the motion judge did not err in giving “derangement” its plain and ordinary
    meaning and in finding that the electrical derangement exclusion did not
    apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard relied on the decision of this court in <i>Fresh Taste</i> and the
    recently decided <i>DeLuca</i> case to support its interpretation of “derangement”.  Both
    cases appear to hold that the derangement exclusion applied in circumstances
    similar to those in this case.  In my view, neither case is of any assistance
    to this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the motion judge in <i>Fresh Taste</i> held that both the temperature and
    derangement exclusions applied, the motion judge did not provide reasons
    for the holding relating to the derangement exclusion and this court dismissed
    the appeal solely on the basis of the temperature exclusion.  As for <i>DeLuca</i>,
    in my view, Patterson J. erred in his interpretation of the derangement exclusion
    in holding, in effect, that a machine dependent on electricity that
    “operates” as expected when the electricity is cut off is deranged.  A further
    problem with <i>DeLuca</i> is that the motion judge appeared to find that
    the temperature exclusion also applied.  It is unclear from his reasons whether
    he was referred to this court’s decision in <i>Commonwealth</i>.</p>

    all of the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs to Caneast
    fixed in the amount of $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
