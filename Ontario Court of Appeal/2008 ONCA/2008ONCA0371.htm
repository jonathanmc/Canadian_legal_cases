    Lovsin sued the estate of her former father-in-law John (“Jack”) Hodgins
    in unjust enrichment. She sought a constructive trust over the assets of
    his estate and payment of $250,000 on the ground that the beneficiaries of
    the estate were unjustly enriched by the service she rendered to Jack Hodgins
    and his late wife, Meryl. Thompson&nbsp;J. dismissed Ms. Lovsin’s action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Ms. Lovsin seeks to set aside the dismissal of her claim. She no
    longer seeks a constructive trust but maintains her claim for monetary compensation.
    She submits that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the evidence
    and also erred in his application of the criteria that ground a claim in
    unjust enrichment. We do not agree with Ms. Lovsin’s submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lovsin was married to Jack’s son, John Hodgins Jr., for 16 years. They separated
    in 1997. During their marriage Ms. Lovsin and her husband lived on a farm
    owned by Jack Hodgins. During that time Ms. Lovsin undoubtedly provided some
    services to Jack and Meryl Hodgins and in so doing contributed to their welfare.
    She helped with the farming operation; she helped to care for her mother-in-law,
    Meryl Hodgins, especially after Meryl became ill with Alzheimer’s disease;
    she occasionally planted trees; and from time to time she provided domestic
    services to her in-laws.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in our view, Ms. Lovsin’s appeal cannot succeed for two reasons: the findings
    of the trial judge on the extent of her contributions; and her failure to
    show that it was unjust for Jack and Meryl Hodgins to accept the services
    that she provided without paying for them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    assessing the evidence on Ms. Lovsin’s contributions, the trial judge found “that
    those contributions referred to were not sufficiently substantial to reach
    even a minimal threshold capable of supporting a finding of unjust enrichment.
    The benefit conferred to Jack Hodgins and any consequent detriment to Johanna
    Lovsin simply are not of such a degree as to attract compensation.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    finding was open to the trial judge on the evidence, and in making it, he
    did not materially misapprehend any of the relevant evidence. Indeed, in
    part, he relied on Ms. Lovsin’s own evidence. Thus, for example, he found
    that “Johanna’s yearly contribution to Jack’s farming operation amounted
    to, at most, a couple of weeks assistance driving the tractor and preparing
    meals during haying season.” He also found that although Ms. Lovsin helped
    Jack Hodgins care for Meryl after the onset of Meryl’s dementia, Jack Hodgins,
    not Ms. Lovsin, was Meryl Hodgins’s primary caregiver. Ms.&nbsp;Lovsin “performed
    light housekeeping, cooking and provided companionship for Meryl”. And the
    trial judge found that Ms. Lovsin contributed to Jack’s well-being as he
    grew older, but only for a couple of years. All these findings support the
    trial judge’s overall finding that Ms.&nbsp;Lovsin’s contributions “were
    not sufficiently substantial” to warrant compensation. They were no more
    than might reasonably be expected from a loving daughter-in-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    even accepting that Ms. Lovsin’s services benefited Jack and Meryl Hodgins,
    this conferring of a benefit does not, by itself, constitute unjust enrichment.
    As Dickson J. said in <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834 at p.
    848: “The common law has never been willing to compensate a plaintiff on
    the sole basis that his actions have benefited another.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    show that the enrichment was unjust, the provider of the benefits (here Ms.&nbsp;Lovsin)
    must reasonably expect to be compensated, and the recipients of the benefits
    (here Jack and Meryl Hodgins) must know or ought to have known of that reasonable
    expectation. In the words of Dickson J. at p. 849 of <i>Pettkus</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[w]here one person in a relationship tantamount
    to spousal prejudices herself in a reasonable expectation of receiving an
    interest in property and the other person in the relationship freely accepts
    benefits conferred by the first person in circumstances where he knows or
    ought to have known of that reasonable expectation, it would be unjust to
    allow the recipient of the benefit to retain it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons show that he was well aware of this requirement of
    a shared expectation of compensation. He found that the requirement had not
    been met, and thus Ms.&nbsp;Lovsin had not established the third criterion
    of a successful unjust enrichment claim: the absence of a juristic reason
    for the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Ms. Lovsin’s expectation of compensation was linked
    to her relationship with her husband, not to the services she provided to
    her in-laws. She did not expect compensation for those services, and thus
    never discussed the subject with Jack Hodgins. Correspondingly, Jack neither
    knew nor ought to have known that Ms.&nbsp;Lovsin expected to be compensated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of the trial judge’s findings of fact, which in our view are supported
    by the evidence, and his conclusion that Ms. Lovsin did not establish the
    absence of a juristic reason for any enrichment, we see no basis to overturn
    the judgment. The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $12,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
