  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sued his former solicitor for negligence because the solicitor
    had failed to raise with the appellant and his wife a significant discrepancy
    between their understanding of the terms upon which they were to be paid
    for the sale of their taxi business and the actual terms for payment contained
    in the sale agreement and related promissory note. The trial judge found
    that the appellant had established the negligence alleged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claimed as damages the difference between the amount of interest
    he and his wife expected to receive, according to their understanding of
    the agreement and the amortization schedule provided by their solicitor,
    and the amount they actually received under the terms included in the agreement
    and promissory note. The difference was $27,143.07.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant had not proven the damages claimed.
    The essence of the trial judge’s reasoning for rejecting the claim for damages
    appears in the following paragraphs of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     I am not persuaded that that figure is
    the measure of Mr. Davidson’s damages. This is because I do not doubt Mr.
    Peake’s evidence that he would never have agreed to pay the interest which
    the Davidsons believed he had agreed to pay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21]     If the Agreement had not been completed
    the Davidsons would have been left with the taxi business. It was apparently
    a successful business which the Davidsons had no intention of selling before
    they were approached  by Mr. Peake. However, there is no evidence before
    me which would enable me to conclude that Mr. Davidson is worse off receiving
    $140,000.00 as a result of selling the business with a cap on the interest
    than he would have been had the business not been sold. Accordingly, although
    I am satisfied that Mr. Kelly was negligent, damages have not been proven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the trial judge that the appellant failed to establish the damages
    claimed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    solicitor’s negligence resulted in the appellant and his wife completing
    a transaction, the sale of their taxi business, that they would have avoided
    had the solicitor told them that they would not receive more than $4600 in
    interest payments under the agreement and note. The respondent was responsible
    for compensating the appellant and his wife for the loss they suffered as
    a result of completing the sale transaction. But the appellant did not prove
    that he had suffered a loss. Without the solicitor’s negligence there would
    not have been a sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not call any evidence to establish that the business, at the
    time of its sale, was worth more than the amount the appellant received from
    the purchaser. In the result, the record is barren of any evidence that the
    solicitor’s negligence caused any loss to the appellant. Proof of damages
    is an essential element in any claim for negligence. <i>Nespolon v. Alford </i> (1998),
    40 O.R. (3d) 355 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) leave to appeal refused [1999] 1 S.C.R. xi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made no order as to costs. No appeal was taken from that disposition.
    We fix the costs of this appeal payable to the respondent at $3,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST. The respondent may well choose not to enforce this
    costs award in its favour in the most unusual circumstances of this case.</p>
