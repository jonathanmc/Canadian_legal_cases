style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    a trial by a judge alone, the appellant was convicted of one count each of
    possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking and production
    of a controlled substance.  The drug in question was marijuana.  The appellant
    appeals his convictions.  He has abandoned his appeal against sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of his conviction appeal, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s
    discretionary decision under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> to admit at trial
    the evidence of drugs found in the appellant’s residence during what the
    trial judge found was an illegal search.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that a <i>Charter</i> s. 8 violation occurred in this case
    and that the violation was serious because it involved trespass by state
    agents onto private residential premises without a warrant.  Before this
    court, the appellant accepts these findings, as does the Crown.  The trial
    judge also ruled, however, that under the analysis mandated by <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987),
    33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), the evidence of the drugs should nevertheless
    be admitted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant makes two main complaints regarding the trial judge’s s. 24(2)
    analysis.  First, he argues that the <i>Charter</i> breach was more serious
    than was found by the trial judge.  Second, he submits that the trial judge
    erred in his approach to the requisite balancing exercise at the final stage
    of his s. 24(2) analysis, by failing to properly assess and take account
    of the seriousness of the breach.  The appellant says that on proper analysis
    of the <i>Collins</i> factors, the evidence of the drugs should have been
    excluded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree for the following reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    there is no dispute that a trial judge’s decision on a s. 24(2) inquiry attracts
    great deference from this court and should not be interfered with unless
    it reflects an error of law or is unreasonable.  See for example, <i>R. v.
    Mann</i> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) at para. 59.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there is no suggestion that the first <i>Collins</i> factor – trial fairness – is
    implicated in this case.  The parties acknowledge that the admission of the
    impugned evidence would not affect trial fairness.  We agree. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    with respect to the second <i>Collins</i> factor – the seriousness of the
    breach – the trial judge found that the breach of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right
    was serious.  The appellant invites this court to conclude, on various grounds,
    that the breach was even more serious than was found by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    we agree, and the Crown appears to concede, that it would have been preferable
    for the trial judge to expressly consider in his reasons the reasonableness
    of the CAS worker’s belief that she had legal authority to enter the appellant’s
    home to investigate whether the home contained a child in need of protection,
    on this record it is clear that the CAS worker had an honest, albeit mistaken,
    belief that she had the requisite authority.  The appellant does not challenge
    the trial judge’s finding that the involved police officers were entitled
    to rely on the CAS worker’s authority to enter the premises when carrying
    out their duty to respond to a request for assistance by a childcare worker.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the record in this case does not support a finding of bad faith
    by the police.  The trial judge expressly found that the <i>Charter</i> violation
    was not flagrant.  He did not find that it was brazen, deliberate or wilful;
    nor does the record support such a characterization of the breach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the findings of the trial judge, this was not a police investigation and
    the police had no prior interest in the appellant.  The police had a duty
    to respond to a request for assistance from the CAS and the evidence supported
    the propriety of a CAS concern about the safety of the CAS worker who attended
    at the appellant’s home.  The trial judge also found that the police did
    not participate in questioning the appellant and that they were performing
    their primary function of keeping the peace by providing protection to the
    CAS worker.  Finally, we reiterate that the trial judge found, and the appellant
    accepts, that the involved police officers were entitled to assume that the
    CAS was exercising its authority lawfully when the CAS worker entered the
    appellant’s home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, we agree with the trial judge that the police cannot
    be said to have acted in bad faith.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    warrantless search of a personal residence is a serious matter.  That said,
    this case simply does not fall within the most serious category of <i>Charter</i> breaches.  The
    trial judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the breach is entitled to
    particularly strong appellate deference.  See <i>R. v. Buhay</i> (2003),
    174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the last stage of the <i>Collins</i> analysis involves the assessment of
    the negative impact, if any, on the administration of justice that would
    be occasioned by the admission of the evidence.  We see no error in the trial
    judge’s analysis of this factor.  He correctly recognized that the <i>Charter</i> violation
    was a serious one “in a number of respects”.  He was also properly alert
    to the serious impact on the administration of justice that would be occasioned
    by the exclusion of the evidence.  We agree with his conclusion that, on
    the facts of this case as he found them, the requisite balancing of all relevant
    factors under the third stage of <i>Collins</i> mandated the admission of
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  </p>
