    appellant mother appeals the application judge’s order granting the parties
    joint custody of their six year old daughter and denying the appellant’s
    request to relocate to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    with the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was born and raised in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    but moved here in 1997.  She married the respondent in 1998.  Their daughter,
    Amelia, was born in August 2001.  The parties separated in March 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that a joint custody order is inappropriate where the parents
    are unable to communicate effectively.  Further, the appellant submits that
    the application judge misapprehended the evidence.  Contrary to the application
    judge’s finding, there had not been <i>de facto</i> joint custody.  The mother
    was not only the primary care giver but, according to the appellant, also
    had sole custody of the child with reasonable access being provided to the
    father.  Awarding custody to the appellant, it is submitted, is in the best
    interests of the child.  We reject this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge considered all of the evidence and found that, following
    mediation, the parents had agreed to and were working within a shared parenting
    arrangement for the child.  Further, the application judge concluded that
    “the evidence that I accept satisfies me that these parents discuss issues
    relating to Amelia and are able to come to a reasonable agreement with respect
    to those issues”, and “the custody arrangement as it exists at the present
    time is one of joint custody and shared parenting”.  In fact, the appellant’s
    own evidence was that she was able to communicate with the respondent on
    the needs and upbringing of the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the respondent has been and continues to be involved in
    the life of their child.  In our view, the application judge’s findings are
    fully supported by the evidence and are dispositive of this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the appellant’s request to move the child to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    , the appellant argues that the application judge erred in failing to appreciate
    that the child’s best interests are served by allowing the child to move
    to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    with the parent who has primary care in spite of its effect on the access
    by the other parent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the application judge committed no error.  As noted earlier, the
    application judge found that the parties had agreed to a shared parenting
    arrangement.  Part of that arrangement was that the child would have primary
    residence with the appellant, but also that neither parent would change residence
    without agreement of the other parent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also found that the child was thriving in her present environment
    and that a move to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    could only serve to disrupt her life.  Although the application judge agreed
    with the appellant’s submission that the appellant would be happier in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    as she would be closer to her family, he found that the appellant had not
    established that the move to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    would provide the appellant with substantially different employment opportunities
    or otherwise improve the appellant’s situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, the application judge found that there would be no real benefit
    to the child as a result of such a move.  On the contrary, a move to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Australia</st1:country-region>
    would disrupt the beneficial relationship that currently exists between the
    child and the respondent, as well as between the child and the respondent’s
    family.  These are findings of fact well supported by the record and are
    entitled to deference in this court.  We see no basis to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    additional point requires comment.  The appellant has suggested that a comment
    made by the application judge in an exchange with counsel at the outset of
    the proceedings indicated that the application judge had prejudged the case.  We
    have reviewed that exchange and, in our view, it simply makes the obvious
    point that custody and residence of the child are closely related.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to costs, the appellant’s financial situation is uncertain as the
    issue of support is still outstanding.  The appellant has limited financial
    resources.  Although the respondent is entitled to costs, these should be
    modest, and should not be payable until the issue of support is finally resolved.  For
    these reasons, we award the respondent costs fixed at $5,000 inclusive of
    GST and disbursements.  The costs are not to be payable until the support
    issue is finally resolved.</p>
