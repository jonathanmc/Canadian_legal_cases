    Novakovic and Irma Kapusniak lived together in a common law relationship
    between 1993 and 2000.  When they began living together, Ms. Kapusniak had
    an ownership interest, directly or through corporate vehicles, in three valuable
    properties: a home at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    14 Cividale Court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Richmond Hill, a cottage in Bracebridge, and an apartment building at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    50 Oxton Avenue in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  She acquired an ownership interest in a fourth during their relationship:
    an apartment building at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    64 Benton Street in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Kitchener.  Mr. Novakovic had virtually no assets but spent a great deal
    of time and effort maintaining and improving Ms. Kapusniak’s various properties
    while he was living with her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties separated in the fall of 2000.  Mr. Novakovic sued Ms. Kapusniak
    claiming an interest in three of her properties,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> damages and spousal support.  The claims were
    tried in 2004-2005.  The trial judge held that Mr. Novakovic was entitled
    to compensation for work he had done on the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Oxton Avenue property and to a 25 percent interest by way of a resulting
    trust in the net profits from the sale of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property.  The trial judge dismissed the remaining claims.  Ms.
    Kapusniak appeals, and Mr. Novakovic cross-appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal and, to a lesser degree, the cross-appeal are largely fact-centred.  Counsels’ arguments
    depend to a significant extent on this court taking a different view of the
    facts than the trial judge did.  The deference owed in this court to a trial
    judge’s findings of fact is well established.  Given the operative standard
    of review applicable to findings of fact, I see no basis to interfere with
    any of the trial judge’s material findings of fact.  To the extent that submissions
    made on the appeal and cross-appeal proceed on assumed facts that are different
    than those found by the trial judge, those arguments must fail.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant challenges the trial judge’s finding both with respect to Mr. Novakovic’s
    entitlement to compensation for work done on the

    Oxton Avenue property and her finding that he had a beneficial interest in
    the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property by way of a resulting trust.  The appellant also challenges
    the award with respect to prejudgment interest.  Finally, the appellant appeals
    costs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    cross-appeal relates to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property.  There is also a contingent cross-appeal from the
    trial judge’s refusal to award support to Mr. Novakovic.  That part of the
    cross-appeal is pressed only if the appellant succeeds in convincing the
    court that the amounts awarded to the respondent in respect of his other
    claims should be reduced.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal except as it relates to one of the arguments involving
    the prejudgment interest calculation.  I think the prejudgment interest should
    be varied in the manner outlined later in these reasons.  I would dismiss
    the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE

    trial judge had a difficult fact-finding task.  Virtually every significant
    fact was in issue.  Neither Mr. Novakovic nor Ms. Kapusniak was entirely
    believable or straightforward in their evidence.  Ms. Kapusniak’s son, another
    important witness, was also less than entirely credible.  The well-established
    principle of deference to fact-finding makes a lot of practical sense in
    a case like this one.  My summary of the facts borrows heavily from the trial
    judge’s findings.  </p>

    Kapusniak and Mr. Novakovic met in August 1993.  He was in his early fifties,
    and she was about ten years older.  Mr. Novakovic was recently divorced and
    Ms. Kapusniak’s husband of over forty years had died in October 1992.  Mr.
    Novakovic and Ms. Kapusniak initially met in a social setting and enjoyed
    each other’s company.  Their relationship quickly developed into a romantic
    one.  In October 1993, at Ms. Kapusniak’s suggestion, Mr. Novakovic moved
    out of his apartment and into her home on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Cividale Court in

    Ms. Kapusniak asked Mr. Novakovic to leave her home.  He was finally removed
    from the home in October 2000.</p>

    maintenance work on the home.  Ms. Kapusniak paid the household bills and
    the two of them shared other costs such as groceries.  The trial judge rejected
    Mr. Novakovic’s claim to a constructive trust interest in the Cividale property.  That
    finding is unchallenged on appeal.  </p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Toronto in 1978 for $650,000.  The property was purchased through Oxton Investments
    Ltd.  As of 1993, Ms. Kapusniak held 80 percent of the shares of that company
    and her son, Edward, held the other 20 percent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Kapusniak had done all of the maintenance work on the Oxton property before
    his death in 1992.  He was a capable, hardworking, frugal man who disliked
    hiring anyone else to do work on his properties.  Ms. Kapusniak found it
    difficult to maintain the property and satisfy the maintenance problems of
    the tenants after her husband died.  Edward lived in the building but did
    not have the ability, time or inclination to do the necessary maintenance
    work.  By 1993, Ms. Kapusniak was worried that she might have to sell the
    Oxton property because of the difficulties maintaining the property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after Ms. Kapusniak and Mr. Novakovic began to see each other, he started
    to do odd jobs at the Oxton apartments, such as painting.  He proved to be
    both hardworking and handy.  As time went on, Mr. Novakovic spent a great
    deal of time working at the Oxton apartments.  The trial judge heard conflicting
    evidence as to how much work he did at the apartments between 1993 and 2000.  She
    reviewed that evidence and ultimately accepted that Mr. Novakovic “worked
    constantly” on the Oxton property and did the “lion’s share” of the work
    on that property.  She concluded at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is not clear
    how many hours each day Mr. Novakovic spent working at Oxton.  He maintains
    that it was about fifteen or sixteen hours per day, “not every day but many
    times it could be everyday for a given period”.  Irma and Ed were not able
    to offer direct evidence on this point.  Neither [was] around the complex
    to see Mr. Novakovic working most of the time he was there.  I am satisfied
    that the plaintiff worked the hours he claimed to have worked and did so
    at Oxton continually over a period from October 1993 to July 15, 2000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to testifying that Mr. Novakovic did not do the work he claimed
    he did at the Oxton apartment, Ms. Kapusniak testified that she paid Mr.
    Novakovic for the work he did.  On her evidence, she paid him some $81,300
    for the work he did at Oxton between 1993 and 2000.  Mr. Novakovic testified
    that he received next to nothing for all the work he did at the Oxton apartments.  As
    in other areas where the evidence conflicted, the trial judge did not fully
    believe either party.  She ultimately concluded that Mr. Novakovic received
    $27,100 for the work he did at Oxton.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    work done by Mr. Novakovic at Oxton benefitted Ms. Kapusniak as owner of
    the property in at least three ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It
    allowed her to keep the property beyond 1993 and enjoy the increase in the
    value of the property which she eventually sold in 2004 for $3,275,000. </li>
    <li>It
      allowed Ms. Kapusniak to pay down the mortgage on the Oxton property more
    quickly because she was not paying for ongoing maintenance.</li>
    <li>It
      improved the property thereby directly increasing its value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was no evidence of the value of the property in 1993 when Mr. Novakovic started
    doing the maintenance or in 2000 when the parties separated.  The trial judge
    could not quantify the increase in the value of the property attributable
    to Mr. Novakovic’s work.  There were other factors that contributed to the
    increase in the value after 1993, including the property’s prime location
    and the termination of the rent control laws in 1998.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that Ms. Kapusniak and Oxton Investments Ltd. were
    unjustly enriched by the work done on the property by Mr. Novakovic for almost
    seven years.  She also concluded that Mr. Novakovic would be adequately compensated
    for that unjust enrichment by a monetary award reflecting the value of that
    work.  For reasons she explained, the trial judge valued that work at $126,000.  From
    this amount she deducted the $27,100 she found had been paid to Mr. Novakovic,
    leaving a net amount of $98,900 owed to Mr. Novakovic in respect of the work
    he did on Oxton. </p>

    suggested that if he had his licence, he could look for properties that they

    Benton Street property was purchased in August 1997 for $3,375,000.  Title
    to the property was taken in Benton Apartments Limited.  Ms. Kapusniak owned
    50 percent of the shares of that company and her son owned the other 50 percent
    of the shares.  Mr. Novakovic was aware of the son’s involvement in the ownership
    of the property at the time it was purchased.  He had no knowledge of how

    of the main factual disputes at trial centred around whether Mr. Novakovic
    contributed any part of the purchase price on the purchase of the Benton
    Street property.  As the selling agent, he was entitled to a substantial
    commission.  Mr. Novakovic took a $50,000 reduction on that commission and
    contributed that money towards the cash needed on closing.  In total $210,000
    was paid in cash on closing by Benton Apartments Limited.  The remaining
    $160,000 came from Ms. Kapusniak and her son.  Mr. Novakovic did not make
    any other financial contribution towards the purchase of the

    Benton property.  She testified, however, that the $50,000 was a loan by
    Mr. Novakovic to Benton Apartments Limited and did not reflect any contribution
    by him as a purchaser towards the purchase of the property.  The trial judge
    considered the evidence at some length and concluded that the $50,000 advanced
    by Mr. Novakovic was not a loan but was a contribution towards the purchase
    price.  There was ample evidence to support this finding.  </p>

    other crucial factual issue in respect of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property was whether there was a common intention between Ms.
    Kapusniak and Mr. Novakovic that they would have a joint ownership interest
    in that property after it was purchased.  Once again, the trial judge carefully
    reviewed the evidence.  She concluded that Mr. Novakovic and Ms. Kapusniak
    formed a common intention to acquire properties together using her capital,
    renovate those properties through his efforts, and share in the proceeds
    of the resale.  Initially, the plan was to purchase and renovate houses.  When
    Mr. Novakovic brought the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    capacity as the agent on the sale, indicated that the “selling agent will
    have an interest in the above-mentioned property”.  This disclosure, required

    of the entire purchase price contributed by Mr. Novakovic.  Counsel fixes
    Mr. Novakovic’s contribution of $50,000 at about 3.6 percent of the purchase

    I explain why I cannot accept this argument, I will outline one of the arguments
    made on the cross-appeal because, in my view, it fails for the same reason.  Counsel
    for Mr. Novakovic on the cross-appeal contends that he was entitled by virtue
    of the presumption of resulting trust to a fifty percent interest in the
    entire
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property between herself and her son cannot affect Mr. Novakovic’s
    fifty percent interest.  He contends that given the presumption of resulting
    trust arising from Mr. Novakovic’s contribution towards the purchase price,
    it must be presumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that Mr. Novakovic
    was a fifty percent owner.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, both arguments outlined above fail because they misconceive the
    basis of the trial judge’s award with respect to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property.  The trial judge did not impose a constructive trust
    on the property by virtue of Mr. Novakovic’s contribution to the purchase
    price and his work on the property.  Had she done so, the proportionality
    of his contribution to the total value of the property would have been significant.  Nor
    did the trial judge presume a resulting trust based on Mr. Novakovic’s contribution
    to the purchase price.  Rather, the trial judge found that Mr. Novakovic
    was entitled to fifty percent of the profits based on her finding of a common
    intention to that effect between Mr. Novakovic and Ms. Kapusniak.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the trial judge’s finding, the trust in favour of Mr. Novakovic grew out
    of the express common intention between Mr. Novakovic and Ms. Kapusniak that
    they would share the profits upon resale.  This intention did not and could
    not touch the son’s separate interest in the property.  That interest was
    well known to Mr. Novakovic.  Nor did the scope of Mr. Novakovic’s beneficial
    interest depend on any contribution he made either to the purchase price
    or to the maintenance of the property.  The extent of his interest was the
    product of the agreement between himself and Ms. Kapusniak.  The resulting
    trust was not by way of compensation to Mr. Novakovic but was rather a reflection
    of the parties’ intention.</p>

    also have imposed a constructive trust with respect to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

    cannot agree with this submission.  Mr. Novakovic did the work pursuant to
    the agreement he and Ms. Kapusniak had reached.  That agreement, which is
    the basis for his ownership interest in the property, required him to do
    the work to maintain and improve the properties for resale.  Having agreed
    to a fifty percent interest in Ms. Kapusniak’s profits based on his monetary
    and non-monetary contributions, Mr. Novakovic cannot turn around and suggest
    that his non-monetary contribution entitles him to a further remedy.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge dealt briefly with the constructive trust claim as it related
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Benton Street property.  She declined to make any award by way of constructive
    trust having found that Mr. Novakovic had a resulting trust interest in the

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property had he not succeeded with the resulting trust argument.  While
    both kinds of trusts may co-exist, there was no basis, for the reasons outlined
    above, to find any unjust enrichment in respect of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Benton Street property.  As a beneficial owner, Mr. Novakovic worked on the
    property and increased its value for the owners, including himself.  The
    work was done pursuant to an agreement which provided that in exchange for
    that work, he would receive a beneficial interest in the profits of the resale.  The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    to September 2005, the date of judgment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the prejudgment interest award should be reduced to
    reflect Mr. Novakovic’s delay in bringing the matter to trial.  This argument
    was made before the trial judge.  She recognized that Mr. Novakovic was responsible
    for some delay in part because of his illnesses.  She also recognized that
    Ms. Kapusniak’s intransigence throughout the proceedings and her control
    of the documentary material necessary to prosecute Mr. Novakovic’s claims
    affected the progress of the proceedings.  In the end, the trial judge held
    that there was no reason to depart from the “presumption” of the entitlement
    to prejudgment interest as set out in s. 128 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    trial judge should consider the conduct of the proceedings and delays attributable
    to particular parties to those proceedings in determining the rate of prejudgment
    interest.  Prejudgment interest is not, however, intended as a means of punishing
    or rewarding parties for the manner in which they have conducted the proceedings.  Its
    role is compensatory.  I see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s
    finding that Mr. Novakovic’s conduct of the claim should not deprive him
    of the compensation due him under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> provisions
    relating to prejudgment interest.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the rate of prejudgment interest should be modified
    to reflect the change in the rate between December 2000 and September 2005.  The
    rate fluctuated between a high of six percent in December 2000 and a low
    of 2.3 percent in 2002.  The average for the time period would appear to
    be about 3.4 percent.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trial
    judges sometimes average prejudgment interest rates over the time period
    between the commencement of the action and the obtaining of judgment.  This
    is particularly appropriate where the prejudgment interest rates fluctuate
    widely.  The onus is, however, on the parties seeking a different rate than
    that imposed by the statute to justify the imposition of that different rate.  I
    do not think the fluctuations in issue in this case are sufficient to hold
    that some averaging of the prejudgment interest rates was essential.  Clearly,
    the trial judge could have averaged the rate but, in my view, she did not
    err in not doing so.  </p>

    do not agree with the argument as it applies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Oxton Avenue property.  The award to the appellant was by way of monetary
    recovery for unjust enrichment not a proprietary interest in the property.  He
    was entitled to be paid when the work was done.  There is no merit to the
    suggestion that his entitlement arose only upon the eventual sale of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Oxton Avenue property in 2004, some four years after Mr. Novakovic had stopped
    working on the property.  </p>
  <h2>V.        THE COST AWARD AT TRIAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal the costs order made at trial.  There is
    no merit to any of the arguments made in support of that request. The trial
    judge was correct in holding that Mr. Novakovic was substantially successful
    at trial. The costs award was relatively modest given the length of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    leave was not requested, the court considered the merits of the costs appeal.  I
    see no merit in it.  The trial judge was correct in holding that Mr. Novakovic
    was substantially successful at trial.  The award was relatively modest given
    the length of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that Mr. Novakovic should not receive his costs because
    while the appellant’s offer was not better than the trial judgment, it was
    closer to the trial judgment than Mr. Novakovic’s offer.  I am not aware
    of any support for this novel proposition.  Certainly, it does not reflect
    the rules as they relate to the costs consequences of offers to settle.  </p>
  <h2>VI.       CONCLUSION</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal save for the single variance in the prejudgment
    interest award as set out above.  I would refuse leave to appeal the costs
    order made at trial.  I would dismiss the cross-appeal.   </p>
