    key provisions of the agreement governing the royalty arrangement between
    Reichert and Lauren are sections 1.01(s), and 2.02(b) and 2.04:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 1.01 <u>Definitions</u><i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(s)       “<u>Principals’ Patent Rights</u>” means
    any and all right, title and interest of the Principals in and to all patents

    including, without restriction, the patents and patent applications listed
    in Schedule H, including all reissues, divisions, continuation and extensions

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 2.02.  <u>Purchase Price</u>.  The Purchase
    Price shall be payable by way of:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       [Shares in Lauren].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       Payment by Lauren to the Principals,

    Gross Sales by Lauren of “Super Spacer” Products commencing in the month
    immediately following attainment of any of the sales tests specified in Subsection
    2.02(a) and ending on the expiry of the Principals’ Patent Rights …
    .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 2.04 <u>Definitions</u>.  The term “‘Super

    for sealed glazing units manufactured and sold by Lauren under Principals’ Patent
    Rights.  “Monthly Gross Sales by Lauren of ‘Super Spacer’ Products” shall
    mean the sales value of “Super Spacer” Products shipped to customers by Lauren

    agreement governed the relationship between Lauren and Reichert, who was
    employed by Lauren, from 1989 to 2006.  In those years, Lauren paid Reichert
    $2,876,745 under s. 2.02(b) of the agreement.  Of this amount, $69,744 was
    paid to Reichert for sales of Super Spacer products in jurisdictions where
    there was no patent protection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    entitled Lauren to stop including sales for Super Spacer products in the
    United States as part of the royalty payments due to Reichert, (ii) the agreement
    did not include inventions developed by Reichert after the agreement was
    concluded, and (iii) the agreement did not require Lauren to pay Reichert

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reichert
    submits that royalty payments owed to him from Lauren, pursuant to s. 2.02(b),
    are based on total sales of Super Spacer products manufactured and sold by
    Lauren under any patent right without restriction.  So long as any patent
    right exists in any jurisdiction, royalties are payable to Reichert under
    the agreement.  Accordingly, the trial judge erred in finding that the plain
    and ordinary meaning of section 2.02(b) of the agreement was to limit the
    1% royalty payment to sales of Super Spacer products only in jurisdictions
    where patent protection existed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core principles for interpreting a commercial contract are well-known.  They
    were recently summarized in this court by Blair J.A. in <i>Ventas, Inc. v.
    Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d)
    254 at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Broadly stated … a commercial contract is to be
    interpreted,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) as a whole, in a manner that gives meaning
    to all of its terms and avoids an interpretation that would render one or
    more of its terms ineffective;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) by determining the intention of the parties
    in accordance with the language they have used in the written document and
    based upon the “cardinal
    presumption” that they have intended what they have said;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) with regard
    to objective evidence of the factual matrix underlying the negotiation of
    the contract, but without reference to the subjective intention of the parties;
    and (to the extent there is any ambiguity in the contract),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) in a fashion
    that accords with sound commercial principles and good business sense, and
    that avoid a commercial absurdity.                                                                                                                                 [References

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>See also: <i>Consolidated
      Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co.,</i> [1980]
      1 S.C.R. 888, and <i>BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro
      and Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the wording of the agreement, the intention of the parties, and
    sound commercial principles all support Lauren’s interpretation of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording of s. 2.02(b) of the agreement cannot be read alone.  In isolation,
    there is ambiguity about the words “the expiry of the Principals’ Patent
    Rights”: does it mean the expiry of the Principals’ Patent Rights <i> in
    the jurisdiction in question</i> or the expiry of the Principals’ Patent
    Rights <i> in all jurisdictions</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the ambiguity is removed if the agreement is read “as a whole”.  Section
    2.04 stipulates that Super Spacer products are products manufactured and
    sold by Lauren “under Principals’ Patent Rights”.  These are the products
    for which royalties are to be paid to Reichert.  With respect to products
    sold in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , Lauren paid these royalties for seventeen years, until the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    patent expired in 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Lauren’s interpretation of the contractual language.  For a product
    to be a Super Spacer product, it must be manufactured and sold by Lauren
    under the Principals’
    Patent Rights.  A product sold in a jurisdiction where there are no Principals’ Patent
    Rights is not, by definition, a Super Spacer product.  Accordingly, when
    a patent that was once included in the Principals’
    Patent Rights expires, products sold in the jurisdiction where the patent
    has expired are no longer sold under Principals’ Patent Rights because those
    particular rights no longer exist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the other two interpretive principles –
    the parties’ intentions and sound commercial principles – I agree with what
    the application judge said about these points:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find the reasonable expectations of the parties,
    which would accord with reasonable commercial expectations, were that where
    no benefit was any longer conferred, such as the exclusive right to market
    the patented product, then no royalty payment would be required.  It would
    not be commercially reasonable for the parties to have intended that Lauren
    would continue making royalty payments for patent rights in a jurisdiction,
    after those patent rights had expired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reichert
    submits that, in making these conclusions, the application judge was reasoning
    outside the record because there was no evidence about reasonable commercial
    expectations in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The application of a standard of commercial reasonableness does
    not necessarily require the consideration of any evidence, extrinsic or otherwise.  Rather,
    the standard of commercial reasonableness is akin to a mode of reasoning
    which must be done objectively: see <i>Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada v. Scott’s
    Food Service Inc.</i> (1998), 41 B.L.R. (2d) 42 at para. 27 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That is what the application judge did in this case, especially in the
    above passage from his reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>Post-agreement inventions</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reichert
    submits that patents and patent applications flowing from his post-agreement
    employment with Canadian subsidiaries of Lauren are covered by the agreement
    and, therefore, generate royalties in his favour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provision that needs to be interpreted on this issue is s. 1.01(s) which,
    for ease of reference, I set out again:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.01(s)            “<u>Principals’

    the application judge, Reichert contended that the new post-agreement patents

    does not revive the ‘extension’ argument on this appeal.  Nor does he contend
    that the new post-agreement patents were reissues, divisions or continuation
    of the patents listed in Schedule H.  Rather, his submission is that the
    new patents come within the word “relating” in s. 101(s).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  I do not think that s. 101(s) supports the very broad linkage
    suggested by Reichert.  My reading  of this provision is that the only patents
    and patent applications that constitute Principals’ Patent Rights are those
    listed in Schedule H.  Additionally, the only way for a patent or patent
    application that is not listed in Schedule H to fall within the definition
    of Principals’ Patent Rights is if it is a reissue, division, continuation
    or extension of the patents or patent applications listed in Schedule H.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, having lost before the application judge on his attempt to link the
    new post-agreement patents to the specific word
    “extensions”, Reichert cannot achieve the same linkage through the much more
    general word “relating”.</p>

    points out that for seventeen years Lauren paid royalties to him based on
    worldwide sales of Super Spacer products, not only on sales in jurisdictions
    with existing patents and patent applications.  Based on this conduct, Reichert
    asserts that Lauren should be estopped from resiling from this position when
    the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    </i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 50 at 57, Sopinka J. set out the components of the
    doctrine of promissory estoppel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principles of promissory estoppel are well
    settled.  The party relying on the doctrine must establish that the other
    party has, by words or conduct, made a promise or assurance which was intended
    to affect their legal relationship and to be acted on.  Furthermore, the
    representee must establish that, in reliance on the representation, he acted
    on it or in some way changed his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reichert’s
    submission founders on the first of these components.  The application judge
    made this finding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the only evidence before me is that
    Lauren made the payments without knowledge that it was not required to do
    so, and the payments were inadvertent.  I find that Lauren’s conduct does
    not amount to having full knowledge of the deficiency and there was no evidence
    that Lauren intended to relinquish its rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can see no basis for interfering with this finding.  Indeed, the fact that,
    during the seventeen year period, Lauren’s excess payments were only 2.4%
    ($69,744 out of $2,876,745) of the total royalty payments to Reichert strongly
    suggests that Lauren’s overpayments before the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    patents expired were based on mere inadvertence.  Accordingly, the attempts
    to correct them were not a belated and unfair change of position.</p>
