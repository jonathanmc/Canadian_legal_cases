    appellant was convicted of attempted murder, robbery, and forcible confinement
    after a 17-day trial before a judge and jury.
     Two earlier trials had resulted in mistrials due to hung juries.  The appellant
    was sentenced to seven years imprisonment in addition to seven years credit
    for time served.  He appeals both his convictions and sentence.</p>

    appellant and the victim, Jack Kong, were acquainted through their attendance
    at casinos and mah-jong gaming houses. On December 20, 2000, the appellant
    and Kong went to Casino Niagara together in the appellant’s van.  They returned
    early on the morning of December 21. Sometime later that day, Kong was stabbed
    in his apartment and robbed of a substantial quantity of cash.  Kong was
    initially unable to communicate effectively with the police, who initially
    suspected that the crime might have involved the collection of a loanshark
    debt associated with Kong’s illegal gambling activities. However, Kong subsequently
    identified the appellant as his assailant.  The appellant testified and admitted
    that he had gone to the casino with Kong and that on the day of the attack,
    he had gone to the appellant’s apartment to deliver some food, but he denied
    any involvement in the crime.  In his defence, the appellant relied on the
    loanshark theory that the police had rejected following Kong’s identification
    of the appellant.  The appellant also introduced evidence as to his whereabouts
    on December 21 that contradicted certain aspects of Kong’s evidence as to
    the events that transpired on the day of the crime. </p>

    victim, Jack Kong, made his living from legal and illegal gambling.  He regularly
    kept a substantial quantity of cash at his apartment.  The appellant and
    Kong had been gambling associates for almost twenty years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evening of December 20, 2000, the appellant drove Kong in his van to
    Casino Niagara.  They separated at the casino and played different games,
    although Kong testified that they had been together near the end of the evening
    when he was involved in a baccarat game.  Kong had a successful evening and
    cashed out at around 3 a.m.  After eating together at the casino café, the
    appellant and Kong began their return trip in the appellant’s van at some
    point between 3:15 and 4 a.m.  On the way back to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto, the van had a flat tire.  While the tire was being changed, Kong
    sustained an injury to his head. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Kong, he was hit on the head with a hammer-type tool that the appellant
    was using.  Kong testified that the appellant apologized and explained that
    the tool had slipped from his hand and, at the time, Kong accepted this explanation.  The
    appellant denied striking Kong either intentionally or accidentally.  He
    agreed, however, that Kong had sustained an injury to his head from which
    he was bleeding, but the appellant denied any knowledge of the cause of that
    injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kong
    testified that the appellant dropped him off at his apartment at 10:30 or
    11 a.m., although he agreed under cross-examination that it was possible
    that his prior estimate of 7 a.m.—the time he had given at the preliminary
    inquiry—could have been accurate.  The appellant told him he was going to
    buy some herbal medicine to help stop the bleeding.  The appellant returned
    with the medicine and assisted Kong in applying it to his head and then left
    the apartment.  According to Kong, sometime later in the day, the appellant
    again returned to the apartment with some food.  After Kong ate the food,
    the appellant told him that he was going to apply further medication.  Kong
    testified that he went and lay face-down on the bed to allow the appellant
    to do so, at which point the appellant stabbed him in the back three times.  A
    struggle ensued and the appellant then held a knife to Kong’s throat and
    demanded money.  Kong gave the appellant some money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then bound Kong’s hands and feet with a telephone cord from the
    apartment, disabled Kong’s cell phone, and washed his hands and the knife
    in the sink. When Kong told the appellant to leave and that he would not
    call the police, the appellant struck him in the face with a frying pan and
    told him to shut up.  The appellant put a plastic bag in Kong’s mouth, covered
    his face with a pillow, and threatened to stay unless Kong “fainted away”.  Kong
    pretended to be unconscious.  The appellant removed the pillow and kicked
    Kong in the knee and stomped on his groin.  Kong managed to feign unconsciousness
    and the appellant left him under a mattress, taking whatever other money
    he could find in the apartment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appellant left, Kong lost consciousness for an undetermined period and
    then struggled out of his apartment into a hallway of his building, where
    he was found by a neighbour who called the police shortly after 6:30 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kong
    suffered life-threatening injuries and, according to the medical evidence,
    it was “remarkable” that he survived.  Kong’s assailant inflicted multiple
    stab wounds to his chest, abdomen, liver, back, neck, left arm, and right
    hand.  He also had two collapsed lungs and the police could not speak to
    him until January 2, 2001, because of his intubation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant gave a very different version of the events of December 21.  He
    testified that he dropped Kong off at Kong’s apartment at 7 a.m. and then
    went home.  He arranged to drive his daughter to school and then called Kong
    to see how he was and whether he needed to go to the hospital to attend to
    the injury he had sustained to his head on the return trip from the casino.  After
    dropping his daughter off at school, he stopped at a restaurant at Kong’s
    request to pick up some food, which he took along with some medicine to Kong’s
    apartment.  He assisted Kong with some cooking but remained in the apartment
    for only around fifteen minutes.  According to the appellant, that was the
    only time he returned to Kong’s apartment.  He denied attacking Kong or robbing
    him and testified that after the visit with the food and medicine, he did
    not see Kong again that day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    he left Kong’s apartment, the appellant testified that he picked up his ex-wife
    at her home and dropped her off at an employment resource centre, returned
    home at about 10 a.m., and then went to sleep.  The appellant had no prior
    criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s ex-wife, Le Hoa Du, testified.  While her version did not precisely
    coincide with that of the appellant, it did support significant elements
    of the appellant’s account of his movements on the morning of December 21.  Du
    testified that the appellant came to her house between 7:45 and 8 a.m. to
    pick up their daughter and drive her to school.  According to Du, at about
    9 a.m., the appellant, Du and their daughter all left together.  They dropped
    the daughter off at school and the appellant then dropped Du off at the resource
    centre.  The resource centre’s records indicate that Du signed in on December
    21 at 10:10 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cell
    phone records indicate that the appellant made several calls to Kong between
    8:20 and 8:23 a.m. on December 21, a call to his wife at about 8:50 a.m.,
    and a call to an unidentified person at around 4 p.m. from a location close
    to the place from which he had called Kong earlier that morning.</p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    investigating officers, some of whom had experience in the Special Task Force
    on Organized Asian Crime, initially suspected that the attack may have been
    retribution from a loanshark and directed the investigation at Kong’s gambling
    connections.  However, after Kong identified the appellant as his assailant,
    the police essentially abandoned the loanshark theory and focussed their
    attention on the appellant as the main suspect.</p>

    trial judge gave the instruction mandated by <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) that dealt only with the appellant’s evidence,
    but said nothing about any other evidence called by the appellant, including
    the evidence of Du and the cell-phone records that corroborated his version
    of the timing of his comings and goings on the morning of December 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that Du’s evidence was crucial to his defence, virtually
    amounting to an alibi, and that the trial judge erred by failing to make
    it clear that the second and third stages of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis are
    not limited to the evidence given by the accused and that any evidence called
    by the defence that is capable of raising a reasonable doubt should be considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that the evidence of Du amounted to an alibi defence sufficient
    to trigger an instruction along the lines mandated by <i>R v. Parrington</i> (1985),
    20 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  At best, Du’s evidence contradicted Kong’s timing of the return from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niagara as occurring at 10:30 or 11 a.m., and established that the appellant
    was involved in transporting his daughter to school and Du to the resource
    centre between 9 and 10 a.m.  Kong testified that the attack occurred later
    in the day and, given the evidence that Kong narrowly escaped death after
    being found at 6:30 p.m. with life-threatening injuries, it is very likely
    that his assailant attacked him much later than 10 a.m.  This means that
    Du’s evidence did not amount to an alibi or to evidence “determinative of
    the final issue of guilt or innocence of the accused”: see <i>R. v. R.(M.)</i> (2005),
    195 C.C.C. (3d) 26 at para. 31 (Ont.

    said, the trial judge should have instructed the jury that at the second
    and third stages of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis, the jury was to consider,
    in addition to the evidence of the accused, all of the evidence called by
    the defence to determine whether it was left with a reasonable doubt: see <i>R.
    v. Haroun</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 261 at para. 15 (S.C.C.).  This deficiency
    in the charge must, however, be considered in the light of the effect of
    the charge as a whole.  The trial judge gave the standard instruction that
    the Crown bore the burden of proof, that the jurors were to decide the case
    on the evidence as a whole, and that if, on the evidence as a whole, they
    were left with a reasonable doubt, they were required to acquit the appellant. </p>

    Sergeant Dan Nealon, then a 19-year veteran of the Toronto Police Service,
    led the investigation together with Detective Craig Morton.  Nealon’s position
    before the jury was prominent.  As the lead investigator assisting the Crown,
    he was exempted from the order excluding witnesses and, for most of the trial,
    he sat with the Crown at the counsel table.</p>

    testified after all but one of the other police officers had given their
    evidence and immediately before Kong testified.  His evidence added little
    to the testimony of the other police officers or to the direct evidence of
    Kong that would follow. The purpose of Nealon’s evidence appears to have
    been to explain the steps the police had taken to investigate the attack,
    and to satisfy the jury that the crime had been properly investigated and
    that the search for Kong’s attacker had been appropriately thorough.</p>

    the investigation.  He described the various steps he took to find information
    about Kong through Kong’s family, his direction of inquiries at the casino,
    and the search for the van. He explained that as there was some thought that
    the attack might be gang-related, a police guard was placed at Kong’s bedside “in
    the off-chance that whoever it was that committed this crime had wanted to
    finish the job off”.</p>

    aspects of Nealon’s evidence as to how the investigation proceeded were based
    upon hearsay or unidentified sources.  At several points, although Nealon
    was cautioned not to give hearsay evidence, he was asked to relate what he
    had done as a result of obtaining information from various sources including
    Kong. Nealon related his efforts to obtain information from Casino Niagara
    that showed the appellant’s history there.  He also testified that a police
    officer had traced the ownership of the appellant’s van.  He related a second-hand
    hearsay description of the appellant given to another police officer by a
    witness. </p>

    various bits of information—some of which he described and some of which
    the Crown conceded was hearsay and which the jury was told it could not receive—were
    assembled, the investigation was “looking significantly better” as he and
    his team honed in on the appellant as Kong’s assailant.  At various points
    in his evidence, Nealon offered his personal opinion as to the appellant’s
    guilt: “It was my intention [sic] at that point [following the interview
    with Kong] that the man responsible for this attack on Jack was a person
    known as Duc Van, driving a 1987 Dodge Caravan, red in colour, with that
    licence plate.” Nealon also testified that he had sufficient information
    to satisfy himself that there were reasonable grounds for arresting the appellant.</p>

    danger that the jury might use the evidence of the investigation as direct
    evidence of the appellant’s guilt was revealed by Crown counsel’s final question
    to Nealon during the examination-in-chief: “Anything else involved in the
    investigation that you can think of right now <i>that might assist the jury

    defence counsel’s cross-examination of Nealon began probing his investigation
    and knowledge of Kong’s involvement in illegal gambling and Asian gangs,
    Crown counsel objected to the potential introduction of hearsay evidence.  As
    a result, defence counsel agreed to restrict his questions to the witness’ suspicions
    about Asian gangs and the steps he took to investigate such suspicions.  Nealon
    agreed that one of the photo line-ups shown to Kong included a man suspected
    of being a collector for loansharks and a potential suspect in the case and
    that one avenue the investigation had followed was the possibility that Kong
    had a gambling debt.  He agreed that he had received information regarding
    a story in a Chinese-language newspaper because of the fear it caused Kong
    when it identified him as a victim and published his name and address.  Nealon
    also agreed that once Kong identified Man Tak (the Cantonese translation
    of Duc Van) as his assailant, all other investigation stopped and the police
    focused on finding the appellant and evidence to corroborate his guilt.</p>

    the defence attacked the integrity of the investigation, the Crown was entitled
    to lead evidence about the police investigation that included hearsay evidence
    as part of the narrative necessary to explain how the investigation proceeded.  However,
    as this court held in <i>R. v. Dhillon</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 262 at
    para. 51, and <i>R. v. Mallory </i>(2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 266 at para. 92,

    was to be used only as narrative to explain how the investigation had proceeded
    and that the hearsay and the sources undisclosed to the jury that were used

    troubling is the suggestion created by Nealon’s evidence as a whole—and in
    particular by what he said in re-examination—that as a result of a body of
    information not disclosed to the jury, he had formed the opinion that the
    appellant was guilty.  Repeated references to information that
    “unfolded” and to “information that I received” could well have been taken
    by the jury to suggest that this senior and respected police officer had
    evidence inculpating the appellant that had not been presented at trial.  The

    and that this omission may have been tactically motivated.  The respondent
    suggests that as the appellant relied on the investigative evidence to support
    the theory that Kong’s assailants were loansharks or Asian gang enforcers,
    a limiting instruction might have undercut that defence.</p>

    the jury about the use of the loanshark/Asian gang evidence: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Did [Kong] need to borrow from loansharks?  His direct evidence
    is that he did not. [Defence counsel] suggests you might make the inference

    should not infer something from nothing, you need evidence not speculation,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    or debt collecting or Asian gang crime came from the police officers who
    started with that in mind because of the injuries that he thought he had
    suffered, and the knowledge that Mr. Kong was deeply involved in the gambling
    culture of Chinatown, but as soon as they were able to interview Mr. Kong
    he told them it was Man Tak and within hours the investigation turned to
    him and found, indeed, he had been with Mr. Kong on the fateful night and

    how, in the light of that instruction, it could have been to the tactical
    advantage of the appellant not to have the required limiting instruction
    as to the permitted use of investigative hearsay and police opinion evidence.  The
    trial judge had already cautioned the jury about the shortcomings of the
    evidence to support the loanshark/Asian gang theory and a limiting instruction

    an error of law in failing to caution the jury with respect to the evidence

    be an appropriate case for the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal

    my view, the error must be considered in the context of the trial dynamic
    and the evidence adduced. The defence theory of the case was that Mr. Kong
    was the victim of an attack by persons unknown who were potentially associated
    with a loan-sharking ring. To this end, Mr. Kong’s lifestyle and gambling
    habits were explored thoroughly through his testimony and that of the accused.
    Defence counsel posited that Mr. Kong may have run afoul of a person or persons
    unknown who could have been the assailant rather than the accused. </p>

line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    furtherance of this theory, defence counsel had Detective Nealon, the investigating
    officer, reiterate from his evidence-in-chief that he focused on the accused
    as the prime suspect early in the investigation and did not pursue other
    possibilities. There were elements of Detective Nealon’s testimony that were
    both hearsay and opinion evidence. In respect of the latter, and presumably
    to the benefit of the defence theory, he admitted that the investigation
    narrowed when he formed the opinion that the accused had committed the assault
    on Mr. Kong. Indeed, it was the shift in the police investigation from loan
    sharks to the accused that provided the underlying evidentiary basis for
    the defence theory.  </p>

    my colleagues have noted, the jury should receive a limiting instruction
    as to the proper use of police investigation and opinion evidence. That said,
    defence counsel raised no objection regarding the evidence offered by Detective
    Nealon at the time it was offered, nor did he request a limiting instruction
    in the charge to the jury or object to the lack thereof.  Contrary to my
    colleagues, I hold the view that this may reflect a tactical decision. Defence
    counsel may have decided not to seek the caution because it would have weakened
    the very evidence upon which the defence theory depended, which was Detective
    Nealon’s evidence that police had initially suspected the offence was gang-related,
    but soon dropped that avenue of investigation to pursue the accused.</p>

    any event, the real issue is whether the error in failing to give this limiting
    instruction resulted in an unsafe verdict, or whether it was one of those “minor
    or ‘harmless’ errors of law where the Crown can establish that no substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.” See <i>R. v. <a name=QuickMark></a>Khan</i>,

    the subsequent vicious attack on Mr. Kong occurred in his apartment. The
    accused offered evidence in an attempt to formulate an alibi for his whereabouts
    during the morning of the assault, but none of his alibi evidence related
    to the late afternoon, which was the apparent time of the attack based primarily
    on the medical evidence. Moreover, the accused had no explanation concerning
    the telephone records which showed a call being placed from his cellphone
    in the vicinity of Mr. Kong’s apartment at 4:00 in the afternoon, two and
    a half hours before Mr. Kong was found with life-threatening injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there is the detailed evidence of the victim, a direct account in which he
    identified the accused as the perpetrator of his vicious assault, and provided
    the blow-by-blow sequence of the attack, including the words attributed to
    the accused that he would wait until Mr. Kong “fainted away”. This evidence
    was not rebutted by the defence, other than to speculate in the hope of raising
    a reasonable doubt, that the beating and robbery were carried out by loan
    sharks and not by the accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence that the ultimate assault for which the accused stood
    trial was one of a chain of events commencing with the roadside blow to the
    head suffered by Mr. Kong.  Further there was evidence of the accused’s involvement
    at every stage in this chain of events.  While the defence theory was that
    the ultimate assault was carried out by someone other than the accused, no
    explanation was offered for the blow to the head suffered by Mr. Kong while
    he changed a flat tire in the presence of the accused and the accused alone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I am not persuaded that the absence of a limiting instruction resulted in
    the jury using the evidence of Detective Nealon for an improper purpose in
    a way that was prejudicial to the accused. In this regard, I do not share
    my colleagues’ view that Detective Nealon’s references to “information that
    unfolded” and “information that I received”
    would have left the jury with the impression that he was referring to inculpatory
    evidence against the appellant that was not disclosed to the jury.  He made
    these references in re-examination, immediately after his detailed testimony
    about the nature of the information gathered by police which led then to
    suspect the appellant.  Defence counsel evidently did not share the concerns
    expressed by my colleagues, as revealed by the lack of an objection and by
    the lack of a request for a limiting instruction.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I am not persuaded that a limiting instruction on the use of Detective Nealon’s
    evidence would have affected in any way the verdict returned on the totality
    of the evidence by a jury that was otherwise properly instructed, as the
    jury was here. In juxtaposition to the compelling nature of the evidence
    implicating the accused in this vicious attack, the almost total absence
    of any evidence from the accused to counter or negate the material facts
    makes it implausible that the absence of the caution could have had any impact
    on the ultimate jury verdict. I have every confidence that the members of
    the jury would have been faithful to their oath. In other words, while an
    error was committed, it is my view that it was an error without consequence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I would dismiss the appeal pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also appealed his sentence, requesting that it be reduced from
    fourteen years to time served. The appellant acknowledged in his factum that
    the range for this type of offence is ten to fifteen years. The trial judge
    was well within his discretion to impose a global sentence of fourteen years.
    I would grant leave to appeal sentence, but dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
