  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central question in this appeal is whether independently discoverable construction
    defects caused by a single act of negligence may give rise to separate causes
    of action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    issues arise in the context of a claim brought by Grey Condominium Corporation
    No. 27 in September 2001, following its discovery of three serious construction
    deficiencies – one in 1993, and the other two in 1996.  If all three defects
    give rise to only one cause of action, then Grey Condo’s claim is statute
    barred.  However, if each defect gives rise to a separate and distinct cause
    of action, then, in light of the trial judge’s unchallenged findings concerning
    discoverability, Grey Condo’s claim for the costs of repairing two of the
    three construction defects is brought within the limitation period provided
    in s. 45(1) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that each deficiency gave rise to a separate cause of action.
    Therefore, Grey Condo’s claim for the costs associated with repairing the
    two deficiencies that the appellant, the Town of the Blue Mountains, negligently
    failed to identify when it reviewed the plans and buildings was brought within
    the prescribed time.  This finding, together with the Town’s admissions concerning
    liability and damages, entitled Grey Condo to judgment against the Town in
    the amount of $298,707.32.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the trial judge was correct
    in concluding that Grey Condo’s claim for the costs of repairing the two
    defects in question was not statute barred. Accordingly, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        The History of the Dispute</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts are straightforward and not in contention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Grey
    Condo, comprised of 55 residential units in 7 free-standing buildings, was
    built during a building boom in Collingwood in the late 1980s.  The building
    permit for Grey Condo was issued in April 1988 and construction was completed
    in December 1989.
     The Town was responsible for issuing the building permit, and for inspecting,
    reviewing and approving the construction. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unknown
    to Grey Condo, at the time of completion, there were several serious problems
    with its buildings:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a)         The condominium buildings were located
    too close together and the exterior walls were not designed to create a sufficient
    fire barrier (the “EIFS problem”<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> or
    “exterior walls”); </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b)         Some of the walls and floors did not
    provide a proper fire barrier (the “internal fire separation problem”); and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>c)         Some of the load-bearing steel beams
    were not properly insulated and therefore did not provide a proper fire barrier
    (the “structural beams problem”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each
    of these problems constituted a breach of the Ontario Building Code and,
    in the event of a fire, represented a serious risk to people and property.  None
    was apparent to a non-professional.  The Town has admitted that it should
    have found these defects during its inspection and review.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    October 1993, Grey Condo was notified that there could be defects with the
    exterior walls.  At that time, another project, known as
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Sierra Lane, built by the same person who built Grey Condo, became notorious
    for its construction deficiencies.  In response to the deficiencies at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Sierra Lane, Grey Condo’s property manager wrote a letter to the president
    of the Grey Condo board of directors warning of potential construction deficiencies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the letter, the property manager specifically expressed concern about a “potential
    lack of one hour fire retardant material on the exterior panels,” and recommended
    a review of Grey Condo’s fire separations.  For various reasons, no steps
    were taken to investigate the concerns raised.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    letter made no reference to the internal fire separation problem or the structural
    beams problem (the “interior defects”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was not until 1996 when it received two more letters about possible construction
    problems that Grey Condo learned of the interior defects. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1998, the plaintiff retained a consulting firm to undertake an investigation.  In
    September 1999, the firm’s report specifically identified all three deficiencies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Grey
    Condo then incurred substantial expense to remedy these defects. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Grey
    Condo did not immediately start legal proceedings because it felt it was
    more prudent to try to resolve the matter through other avenues.  Finally,
    in August 2001, Grey Condo commenced this action, claiming reimbursement
    for the costs of remedying the three defects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Town admitted liability and damages, but submitted that the claim was statute
    barred. Against this background, the Town brought a motion for summary judgment.  </p>
  <h2>(ii)      The Summary Judgment Motion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the summary judgment motion, the Town argued that the plaintiff was aware
    or ought to have been aware of the three deficiencies well before August
    1995 – i.e. six years prior to the issuance of the statement of claim. Grey
    Condo took the position that it was not aware of the problems until it received
    the consultant’s report in 1999. The motion judge granted summary judgment
    in relation to the EIFS defect and struck that portion of the claim.  His
    conclusion was based on the finding that the October 1993 letter gave Grey
    Condo notice of that defect and, therefore, the plaintiff’s claim for reimbursement
    for the costs associated with repairing the EIFS deficiency was statute barred.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    balance of the motion, relating to the internal fire separation and structural
    beams deficiencies, was dismissed. The issue of whether Grey Condo’s claim
    for reimbursement of repair costs associated with the interior defects was
    commenced within the limitation period proceeded to trial.  </p>
  <h2>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge began by recognizing that Grey Condo had the onus of establishing
    that it commenced its action with respect to the interior defects within
    the relevant limitation period.  Based on the discoverability principle,
    he stated that the limitation period did not begin to run until the earlier
    of when Grey Condo knew or ought to have known that it had a cause of action
    against the Town.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    he outlined the Town’s position, which is the same as on appeal: separate
    deficiencies do not give rise to separate causes of action; rather, each
    deficiency is a distinct measure of damages.  According to the Town, since
    Grey Condo was aware of the external defects in October 1993, its cause of
    action, in relation to all defects became statute barred as of October 1999.
    In support of this position, the Town cited <i>Cahoon v. Franks</i>, [1967]
    S.C.R. 455; <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549; and <i>Winnipeg
    Condominium Corp. No. 36 v. Bird Construction</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the other side of the equation, the trial judge considered <i>Carleton Condominium
    Corp. No. 21 v. Minto Construction Ltd. </i>(2001), 47 R.P.R. (3d) 32 (Ont.
    S.C.J.) aff’d (2004), 15 R.P.R. (4th) 161 (Ont. C.A.), which held that distinct
    construction deficiencies not discoverable by due diligence may give rise
    to separate causes of action. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    discussing these cases, the trial judge synthesized the law and responded
    to the Town’s argument as follows at paras. 64-68:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If we stand back from the decisions in <i>Winnipeg
      Condominium</i>, <i>Cahoon</i> and <i>Peixeiro</i>, there is no conflict
      with <i>Carleton Condominium</i>.  <i>Winnipeg Condominium</i> holds that
      a cause of action will lie against [a] builder by a subsequent purchaser
      for pure economic loss caused by negligence that gives rise to serious
      danger.  The pure economic loss in <i>Carleton Condominium</i> was found
      to be recoverable.  <i>Peixeiro</i> holds that a plaintiff is not deprived
      of his right to sue by operation of the limitations law before he has actual
      or constructive knowledge of his claim.  That is what Justice Aitken held
      in <i>Carleton Condominium</i>.  <i>Cahoon</i> stands for the proposition
      that a plaintiff may amend after a limitations period to add claims for
      different heads of damage arising out of the same set of facts that gave
      rise to the original claim.  Justice Aitken held that different defects
      in a construction project are different factual bases for claims, and thus
      different causes of action.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Many things can go wrong in the construction of
    a building.  Builders have a duty to their customers, and to anyone using
    the building, to take reasonable care to ensure the building is safe.  Others
    share this duty with the builder, including architects, sub-trades, inspectors,
    and the like.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As time passes, new things come to light.  If they
    are matters of workmanship, and not safety, then the owner may be restricted
    to a remedy in contract, and subsequent owners may not have a right of action.  But
    if something comes to light that poses a serious risk to the occupants of
    the building, a tort claim may be made.  That is the principle in <i>Winnipeg
    Condominium</i>. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If the Town’s position is correct, as soon as the
    first deficiency comes to light, the limitations clock starts to tick in
    respect to all deficiencies, known or unknown.  In my view, the principle
    in <i>Winnipeg Condominium</i> would be unduly narrowed if discovery of one
    deficiency triggers the limitations period for all deficiencies.  As stated
    in <i>Winnipeg Condominium</i>, the duty to take care is owed to all occupants
    of the building during its useful life, and not just to the original owner
    until the time of discovery of the first latent defect in the project. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Therefore, separate deficiencies do give rise to
    separate causes of action.  The holding in <i>Carleton Condominium</i> is
    clear that the limitations period for a claim based on a specific deficiency
    does not arise until that deficiency is known or ought to be known by the
    plaintiff. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    based on the significant amount of evidence concerning discoverability, including
    expert evidence, the trial judge found that the October 1993 letter alerted
    Grey Condo only of the need to check the exterior walls. The plaintiff had
    no reason to investigate other construction deficiencies.  As well, the trial
    judge found that there was no reason why a consultant engaged to review the
    fire safety qualities of the exterior walls would have investigated or found
    the interior deficiencies.  Accordingly, while these deficiencies were readily
    discoverable through a review of the building plans (in fact, they were discovered
    in this manner) and no destructive investigation would have been necessary,
    they would not have been discoverable upon the use of reasonable diligence.  The
    trial judge therefore found as a fact that a reasonable and competent investigation
    of the concerns raised in the October 1993 letter would not have uncovered
    the internal fire separation and the structural beams problems. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge found that the Town only conducted one review of the plans,
    and that this review missed all the defects.
     He made this finding after reasoning that a tort action against a builder
    is different than one brought against an inspector.  In the former, the negligent
    conduct may be multi-faceted and occur on different occasions over a period
    of time.  However, the same could not necessarily be said about a municipality
    fulfilling its obligations to review building plans and construction. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    made this second finding of fact, the trial judge stated that the focus should
    not be on the tortfeasor’s conduct but on the nature of the deficiency.  Flowing
    from his synthesis of the law, he held that where the deficiencies are truly
    distinct, such that one is not going to be uncovered at the same time as
    the other, then the limitations period will be separate – regardless of whether
    the deficiencies arose from one act of negligence or factually separate incidents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this regard, he found that while the problems all related to fire safety,
    they were distinct deficiencies and the limitations period ran separately
    on the interior defects.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    basic issue on this appeal is whether there are separate causes of action

  <h2>THE APPEAL</h2>
  <h2>(i)        <span class=StyleHeading2UnderlineChar><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    stated above, the Town’s argument on appeal is the same as its argument at
    trial.  It submits that a cause of action has only one limitation period,
    and that the trial judge erred when he effectively split the claim arising
    out of one act of negligence by identifying two separate limitations periods. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    there can only be one claim and since the EIFS claim is statute barred, the

'><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    essence of Grey Condo’s argument lies in the discoverability principle as
    applied in construction cases.  According to Grey Condo, negligent conduct
    that causes different defects to different parts of a building may give rise
    to multiple claims – as this court accepted in <i>Carleton Condominium</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against
    this background, Grey Condo submits it was open to the trial judge to find
    that the interior and exterior defects could be the subject of separate claims. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the trial judge’s unchallenged finding of fact that Grey Condo could not
    have reasonably discovered the interior defects before August of 1995, the
    claim in relation to those defects was not statute barred. </p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issue is whether the plaintiff can advance more than one claim in
    relation to the Town’s negligence in not identifying the design and construction
    deficiencies in the Grey Condo buildings.  If that question is answered affirmatively,
    then, based on the trial judge’s finding that Grey Condo could not, with
    reasonable diligence, have discovered the existence of the interior defects
    before 1996, the appeal ought to be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    return to the trial judge’s analysis of this issue.  His reasoning centres
    on two propositions. First, the focus should not be on the conduct of the
    tortfeasor but on the nature of the deficiencies.  Second, deficiencies are
    distinct where the discovery of one would not reasonably give rise to the
    discovery of the other.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have concerns with the trial judge’s reasoning that the focus should be on
    the nature of the deficiencies rather than on the conduct of the tortfeasor.  If
    his intention was to advance this as a general proposition of law, this perspective
    runs the risk of eroding the important principles of repose and finality.  However,
    based on the analysis below, I agree with his ultimate conclusion that, in
    cases involving construction defects, emphasizing the nature of the deficiencies
    is appropriate in recognizing distinct causes of action, arising out of one
    act of negligence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    say this for two reasons.  First, the discoverability principle is a tool
    of general application to ensure individuals are not unjustly denied their
    right to bring claims.  Second, to ensure public safety, in circumstances
    involving construction defects, courts have been prepared to use this tool
    to allow multiple claims arising out of one act of negligence.  </p>
  <h2>(i)        The Discoverability Principle</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    a plaintiff to establish a defendant’s liability in negligence, the plaintiff
    must show: (i) that he was owed a duty of care by the defendant; (ii) that
    the defendant should have observed a particular standard of care when performing
    or fulfilling that duty; (iii) that the defendant failed to observe that
    standard of care (i.e. negligence); (iv) that such failure caused damage
    to the plaintiff; and (v) that such damage was not too remote a consequence
    of the breach: see G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The Law of Torts in Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed.

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Lord Denning, in <i>Sparham-Souter v. Town &amp; Country Developments
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Essex) Ltd.</i>, [1976] Q.B. 858 at 866-867, if a cause of action for negligence
    accrues on the date when damage is sustained (rather than discovered), then
    a plaintiff could be deprived of the right to bring a claim despite not knowing
    of his or her claim. He then held, “[t]ime should not begin to run against
    [a plaintiff] until he [knows] of the [defect] or could, with reasonable
    diligence, have discovered it.”  In other words, for a person to have an <i>actionable</i> injury
    he must be aware of it or must reasonably be taken to be aware of it, and
    the limitation period will not start to run until such time. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    reasoning was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Nielsen v. Kamloops
    (City),</i> [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2, where one of the issues that arose was whether
    the plaintiff’s action was barred by the <i>British Columbia Municipal Act,</i> R.S.B.C.
    1960, c. 255.  In adopting the discoverability rule, the Court expressed
    the view that the injustice of statute barring a claim before a plaintiff
    is aware of its existence takes precedence over any difficulty encountered
    in investigating historical facts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span

    in <i>Central &amp; Eastern Trust Co. v. Rafuse</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147,
    the Supreme Court held that the discoverability rule was as applicable to
    cases involving professional negligence as it was to actions involving injury
    to property.  In fact, the Supreme <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>Court held at p. 224 that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Kamloops</i> established “a </span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>general
    rule that a cause of action arises for purposes of a limitation period when
    the material facts on which it is based have been discovered or ought to
    have been discovered by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence”.</span> </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    development of the discoverability rule continued in <i>Peixeiro</i>, <i>supra.</i>  In
    that case the plaintiff, following a car accident in 1990, was advised by
    his doctor that he had suffered mild soft-tissue injuries.  In 1993, the
    plaintiff was diagnosed with a disc protrusion in his spine.  He sued in
    1994 for damages arising from the 1990 accident.  The defendants argued that
    the claim was statute barred by virtue of s. 206 of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s<i> Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, which provided
    for a limitation period of two years from the time “when the damages were
    sustained”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendant’s submissions seemed well reasoned since the plaintiff had discovered
    the mild soft-tissue injuries in 1990.  However, in deciding in favour of
    the plaintiff, Major J. held that despite the plaintiff’s knowledge of some
    injury, he did not know, prior to June 1993, that his injuries were serious
    enough to satisfy the “permanent serious impairment” threshold within the
    meaning of s. 266(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  In
    other words, since a component of the cause of action was the seriousness
    of the plaintiff’s injuries, the cause of action did not accrue until this
    level of damages was discovered. Justice Major therefore held that the claim
    should be allowed to proceed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More
    important, however, the Supreme Court in <i>Peixeiro </i>took the discoverability
    principle one step further by specifically identifying it as an interpretive
    tool to construe limitations provisions.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the discoverability rule is now available to respond to the competing issues
    involved in limitation period disputes –
    namely, access to justice on the one hand and repose, finality and evidentiary
    staleness, on the other: see <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 for
    a discussion of these principles.</p>

      Condominium</i>, due to obvious problems with the brick cladding discovered
      in 1986, on a building constructed in 1972, the owners sued the builder/developer
      for negligent design and construction.  The matter was settled in 1987.  Subsequently,
      the plaintiff determined that there was a deficiency in the block wall.  The
      defendants claimed that the claim was <i>res judicata</i> and statute barred.  </p>

    addressing these defences, the trial judge’s decision was based primarily
    on issues pertaining to <i>estoppel</i>.  In particular, the trial judge
    cited the rule in <i>Henderson v. Henderson </i>(1843), 3 Hare 100 aff’d
    in <i>Doering v. Grandview (Town)</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 621: the plea of <i>res
    judicata</i> applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which
    the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce
    a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of
    litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might
    have brought forward at the time.   She then found that the defects in the
    block wall could not reasonably have been discovered with due diligence and
    hence the plaintiff was not estopped from raising the claim. </p>

    the trial judge still had to consider whether the claim was statute barred.  In
    this regard she re-emphasized that the claim could not have been discovered
    before 1993, and, since the second action was commenced in 1995, it was brought
    in time.  She held that it would be impractical, when dealing with a matter
    as complex as the construction of an apartment building, to expect the owner
    to be able to identify all latent deficiencies at any given point in time

      v. M.(H.)</i>, the discoverability principle was, arguably, extended to
      define the elements of the cause of action in a way that allowed an incest
      victim to bring her claim. The issue arose after the plaintiff advanced
      a claim of assault, battery and breach of fiduciary duty on the basis of
      having been a childhood victim of incest by her father.  The plaintiff
      did not commence her action until after entering therapy late in her twenties.  At
      trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000 in damages, but the judge
      held that the claim was statute barred.  According to the trial judge,
      the plaintiff had discovered that she had been wronged and suffered adverse
      effects when she was sixteen. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court, however, took a functional approach and identified a presumption
    that it is only through therapy that certain incest victims discover the
    necessary connection between their injuries and the wrong done to them.  According
    to the court at pp. 45-47:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Battery consists of wrongful touching, and it is the wrongfulness of the
    contact and its consequential effects that are the material facts the plaintiff
    must discover before her cause of action accrues…. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear from the evidence and the scientific
    literature that a misapplied sense of responsibility is instrumental in conditioning
    the child victim to submit silently to the abuse, while at the same time
    serving as the catalyst for much of the consequential psychological and emotional
    damages that emerge over time. More importantly, though, it is the redirection
    of responsibility for the abuse to whom it properly belongs that initiates
    the therapeutic process, such that the victim becomes aware of the causal
    connection between her childhood history and resulting injuries.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The close connection between therapy and the shifting
    of responsibility is typical in incest cases. In my view, this observed phenomenon
    is sufficient to create a presumption that certain incest victims only discover
    the necessary connection between their injuries and the wrong done to them
    (thus discovering their cause of action) during some form of psychotherapy. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court held that even if the plaintiff was generally aware, while
    a teenager, that she wanted the abuse to stop, it was only once she had a “substantial
    awareness” of the wrong committed that her cause of action had accrued, and
    that this level of awareness presumptively arose during therapy.  The Supreme
    Court adopted this approach even after considering the purposes of statutes

    Supreme Court used the discoverability rule to modify the tort of battery – specifically,
    the awareness component.  This modification affected the time when the cause
    of action could be said to have accrued.  In this fashion, the Supreme Court
    provided an incest victim the opportunity to redress damages that otherwise
    would have been statute barred because of her prior, though limited, awareness
    of wrongdoing and its negative effects. </p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Winnipeg</i><i> Condominium, supra, </i>where the owner/developer of an
    apartment building sold it to a purchaser who had no privity of contract
    with the contractor who built the building.  Later, the purchaser had to
    incur substantial repair costs after a large slab fell from the building.  The
    purchaser sued the contractor in negligence, claiming economic loss for the
    repairs.  The Manitoba Court of Appeal struck the claim as disclosing no
    cause of action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court, in allowing the appeal, held that individuals who negligently
    design and construct buildings can be held liable for the costs of repairing
    dangerous defects.  In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court reasoned
    that individuals should be liable for these costs because the defects in
    question could, if not repaired, harm persons or property, which would result
    in other causes of action (at paras. 35-43). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='
color:black'>It is clear that the analysis in <i>Winnipeg Condominium</i> was
      focused on the problems of recovery for pure economic loss and the various
      conceptual arguments that might take a case out of the pure economic loss
      category and put it into the direct physical injury category.  However,
      it is equally clear that, in this decision, the Supreme Court expressed
      an intention to open up avenues of redress in construction cases involving
      defects that pose a substantial danger to the health and safety of occupants.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the trial judge that the “single cause of action” theory upon
    which the Town relies in this appeal is contrary to the underlying principle
    established in <i>Winnipeg Condominium</i> as it would allow builders and
    other individuals involved in the construction industry to avoid liability
    for subsequently discovered dangerous defects.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    makes the argument that the single cause of action paradigm should not be
    applied to construction deficiency cases particularly compelling is that
    it does not violate the important principles underlying statutes of limitation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it is clear that repose is best served by accepting the Town’s position,
    the evidentiary objective is different.  Key issues to be litigated in latent
    deficiency cases are the existence of the deficiency, its proximate cause
    and the resultant damage.  Evidence relating to these issues tends to develop,
    rather than disappear, over time.  The diligence factor does not enter into
    the equation at all since diligence obligations cannot reasonably be imposed
    on a plaintiff who is blamelessly ignorant due to the inherently undiscoverable
    nature of the injury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view therefore, given the inherently latent nature of construction defects,
    and given that they will often be discovered over a period of time, it is
    neither logical nor fair to deny innocent victims an opportunity to seek
    redress for the wrongs done to them, based solely on the single cause of
    action paradigm.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    said, trial judges must be careful to ensure that the deficiencies in question
    are clearly independently discoverable.  Failure to do so could undermine
    the need for finality in litigation.  As Doherty J.A. expressed it in <i>Tsaoussis
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Baetz</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 257 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 14: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finality is an important feature of our justice
    system, both to the parties involved in any specific litigation and on an
    institutional level to the community at large.  For the parties, it is an
    economic and psychological necessity. For the community, it places some limitation
    on the economic burden each legal dispute imposes on the system and it gives
    decisions produced by the system an authority which they could not hope to
    have if they were subject to constant reassessment and variation.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    party should not be allowed to pursue a claim, in a separate action, for
    damages based on a construction defect arising from the same act of negligence,
    where the damages sought are simply an attempt to litigate an issue that
    could have been previously pursued.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Town’s position would deny Grey Condo any access to justice in relation to
    its claim for reimbursement for the costs of addressing the interior defects,
    defects that were serious and for which the Town admitted liability.  In
    light of the trial judge’s findings of fact and the foregoing reasoning,
    there are no circumstances in this case that would support a conclusion to
    this effect.  Nor is there any basis to depart from the reasoning in <i>Carleton
    Condominium, supra.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    hold, therefore, that Grey Condo’s claim for reimbursement for the costs
    it incurred to remedy the interior defects is separate from its claim in
    relation to the EIFS defect.  The interior deficiency claim was commenced
    within time and Grey Condo is therefore entitled to judgment against the
    Town.</p>
