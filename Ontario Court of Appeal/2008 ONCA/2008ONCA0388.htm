    Bruce LeVan (the “husband”) appeals from the judgment of Backhouse J., which
    set aside a marriage contract that he entered into with the respondent, Erika
    Margaret LeVan (the “wife”) prior to their marriage for failure to comply
    with s. 56(4) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (“<i>FLA</i>”).  The
    husband was ordered to pay the wife an equalization payment of $5.3 million
    as well as retroactive spousal support of $163,340.  The trial judge ordered
    that post-judgment interest shall accrue on the entire equalization payment
    and the lump sum spousal support from the date of the judgment.  In addition,
    the trial judge awarded monthly spousal support of $6,640 based on the husband’s
    yearly income of $370,000 commencing June 1, 2006, to be reduced pursuant
    to a formula in accordance with receipt of the equalization payment and to
    be credited against post-judgment interest.  The husband was also ordered
    to pay child support for two children in the amount of $4,544 monthly, and
    retroactive child support of $43,792.  Costs of $646,602.20 were awarded
    to the wife. </p>

    two young children of the marriage.  The parties separated on October 27,
    2003.  The issues involved in this dispute revolve around a marriage contract
    that was signed by the parties on June 20, 1996, two days prior to the marriage. </p>

    the time the marriage contract was signed, the husband was a very wealthy
    man.  The husband and his family own the majority of shares of Wescast Industries
    Inc. (“Wescast”), the world’s largest manufacturer of exhaust manifolds,
    and a publicly traded company.  Mr. LeVan Sr., together with his wife, created
    a complex corporate structure that included a number of different companies
    and a family trust (the “LeVan Family Trust”).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1996, the husband and his three siblings each held 25 per cent of the common
    shares of three companies within the corporate structure: RyVan Inc. (“RyVan”),
    Grannyco Investments Ltd. (“Grannyco”) and RWL Investments Ltd. (“RWL”).  In
    addition, all four siblings were the sole beneficiaries of the LeVan Family
    Trust, in which there were significant assets.  It was the opinion of Linda
    Brent, the wife’s valuator, that at the date of marriage, the midpoint value
    of the husband’s business assets was over $14 million, after applying significant
    discounts and deducting contingent taxes. Ms. Brent’s evidence was uncontradicted,
    as the husband did not provide the court with a valuation of his net worth
    at the dates of marriage, separation or trial.  This would have assisted
    the court in assessing the impact of the equalization payment on his net
    worth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was always the desire of Mr. LeVan, Sr. to protect the shares of the family
    company.  Thus, any child contemplating marriage was instructed to enter
    into a pre-nuptial agreement, or marriage contract, in which it was provided
    that the proposed spouse release all claims to Wescast shares.  In this way,
    Mr. LeVan, Sr. intended to keep the shares of the family company within the
    family.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    LeVan, Sr. retained the services of George Wilson at Gowling LaFleur Henderson
    (“Gowlings”) as his corporate legal adviser.  With Mr. Wilson’s assistance,
    the LeVan family members entered into a Voting Trust Agreement and a Unanimous
    Shareholders Agreement, to which were attached model marriage contracts.  Each
    agreement provided that any family member, who was to be married and who
    wished to continue to hold shares in Wescast, had to enter into a marriage
    contract based on the model contract.  As it was frequently the subject of
    conversation around the dinner table at family gatherings, the husband, his
    siblings, and their prospective partners knew of the desire to maintain control
    of Wescast shares within the family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    model marriage contract contained provisions to protect the LeVan family’s
    control of Wescast.  However, it did not require the prospective spouse to
    agree to exclude assets from equalization or to limit support rights.  Rather,
    the agreements restricted the actions that could be taken directly against
    the LeVan family companies and stipulated the method of valuation of the
    LeVan company shares for the purposes of a property or support claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband was the first of the four siblings to enter into a marriage contract.  Before
    their engagement in December 1995, the wife was aware that if she and Mr.
    LeVan were to marry, they would have to enter into a marriage contract as
    Mr. LeVan, Sr. wanted to make sure that the Wescast shares stayed within
    the family.  A month or so after the engagement, and shortly after the wedding
    venue was booked for June 22, 1996, the wife broached the subject of the
    marriage contract with the husband as she thought it would have to be dealt
    with before the wedding.  The husband told her not to worry because there
    was a lot of time until the wedding.  He said that his lawyers were working
    on it.  He reassured the wife, telling her that the marriage contract was
    only to ensure that if they split up, there would be no possibility of an
    outsider taking over Wescast.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the husband did nothing about the marriage contract until May 8, 1996, six
    weeks before the wedding date.  On that occasion, for the first time, he
    met with Karen Bales, a family law lawyer at Gowlings, the corporate lawyers
    for the LeVan companies.  The husband testified that he had nothing to do
    with the property provisions of the marriage contract which were created
    and mandated by his father and Mr. Wilson.  As confirmed by Ms. Bales, the
    husband was only interested in support provisions and the provision regarding
    the matrimonial home.  He did not wish to pay the wife support in the event
    of a marriage breakdown.  Mr. LeVan, Sr. died in April, 2003.  Mr. Wilson
    was not called as a witness.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>V</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Bales’ first draft of the contract, which she sent to the husband, provided
    that the LeVan companies were to be treated as excluded property, including
    any property into which they could be traced.  However, there was no restriction
    on the wife’s right to support and she was entitled to a joint interest in
    the matrimonial home.  Subsequent changes to the first draft made the marriage
    contract more favourable to the husband and less favourable to the wife.  Subsequent
    drafts maintained this inequity.  A significant change in the final draft
    was the insertion of paragraph 8 (c), which severely restricted the wife’s
    right to claim support if there was a marriage breakdown.  That clause limited
    the wife’s support to the income and assets that were not excluded in the
    contract.  These changes extended far beyond the model marriage contract
    attached to the Voting Trust Agreement and the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 16, 1996, Ms. Bales sent the draft marriage contract to Mr. Wilson.  Her
    accompanying memo informed Mr. Wilson that under the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> the husband was required to disclose to the wife all of his significant
    assets and liabilities.  She told him that she would like to provide enough
    detail to satisfy the other side, without providing more information than
    was necessary.  She directed Mr. Wilson’s attention to Schedule A to the
    contract, which constituted the husband’s disclosure.  She also directed
    his attention to a footnote in that Schedule, which stated that the interests
    of the LeVan family members in the LeVan Family Companies were frozen through
    an estate freeze in January 1996 at a freeze value per share of $9.75 (U.S.).  Mr.
    Wilson did not reply to Ms. Bales’ memo. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Schedule
    A was the only financial disclosure provided by the husband.  It indicated
    that the husband had no debts.  His net worth was disclosed as “$80,000 +
    LeVan Family Companies interest”.  It disclosed that the $80,000 was held
    in RRSPs, bank accounts and the original house deposit.  It disclosed that
    the husband owned 100 common shares in RyVan Inc.  This Schedule was accompanied
    by a declaration that each party had fully and completely disclosed to the
    other the nature and extent of all of his or her significant assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    there was a great deal of information that was not included in the Schedule
    A disclosure.  The Schedule provided no disclosure of the husband’s income.  No
    values were inserted for his interest in the LeVan Companies or for his contingent
    beneficial interest in the LeVan Family Trust.  The absence of this information
    proved to be significant, as the wife’s valuator valued the mid-point range
    of the husband’s business assets at the date of marriage at $14,664,500.  In
    addition, the husband did not disclose that he owned one common share in
    each of Grannyco and RWL.  Ms. Brent valued the midpoint range of these two
    shares at the date of marriage as $1.9 million and $7.250 million respectively. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the footnote included in the Schedule was later found to have been
    inaccurate, since not all the interest in the LeVan Family companies were
    frozen.  The footnote also failed to disclose how many shares were frozen
    or how many shares the husband held.  It was of no help in providing disclosure
    of the husband’s assets.  Indeed, as Ms. Bales acknowledged, the footnote
    was meaningless as it disclosed insufficient information.</p>

    late May, the wife was provided with a copy of the final draft of the marriage
    contract.  The husband advised her to get her own lawyer to review the contract.  She
    had never had any dealings with a lawyer.  Based on her parents’

    May 28, 1996, Ms. Bales sent Mr. Ross the draft marriage contract with a
    covering letter that gave him some background.  She described this as a “first
    go-round” in the expectation that Mr. Ross would ask for more information.  Mr.
    Ross did request additional information.  He asked for the values of the
    husband’s interest in the LeVan companies and for the holdings in the Family
    Trust.  Although she acknowledged in her testimony that it was essential
    that the wife know the husband’s income and her worth, Ms. Bales did not
    give Mr. Ross any information other than Schedule A.  She testified that
    she sent Mr. Ross the information that had been provided to her.  However,
    as the trial judge observed, Ms. Bales had access to much more significant
    information about the husband’s income and net worth through Gowlings and
    the corporate accountants of the LeVan Family Companies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ross first met with the wife on June 3, 1996.  At that time, she informed
    him that her understanding was that the purpose of the contract was to protect
    the shares in the LeVan Family Companies and to ensure that the Wescast shares
    did not go outside the family.  She also told him that her husband had said
    that there would be no marriage unless she signed the contract.  Mr. Ross
    informed her that the agreement went much further than merely protecting
    the family’s shares in Wescast and that, in his opinion, it did not treat
    her fairly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    written correspondence to Ms. Bales, Mr. Ross expressed the view that the
    contract was unfair and overreaching and continued to request disclosure
    of the value of the holdings in the Family Trust.  He even proposed drafting
    his own contract.  In subsequent correspondence, Ms. Bales provided some
    more detailed information concerning the husband’s share holdings, however,
    she did not provide values.  </p>

    further disclosure provided by Ms. Bales was seriously misleading and littered
    with informational gaps.  Ms. Bales failed to disclose that that husband
    and his three siblings had always been treated equally under the LeVan Family
    Trust, and that it was his parents’ intention to continue to treat the children
    equally.  She misrepresented that the husband’s contingent interest in the
    Trust had a “very minimal value” at the date of marriage, whereas Ms. Brent
    valued the holdings of the Trust at $30 million.  She responded to Mr. Ross’
    request for values for the husband’s business interests as a request for
    full valuations and refused to provide such on the basis of cost and time. </p>

    addition, at the request of Mr. Ross, she sent him copies of the Voting Trust
    Agreement and the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement, and directed his attention
    to the Schedules to those agreements which set out the minimum terms of the
    model marriage contract.  This simply served to enhance Mr. Ross’ confusion
    since the marriage contract prepared by Ms. Bales did not contemplate equalization
    of net family property and was substantially and materially different from
    the model contracts in the two agreements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the wedding approached and without a contract signed, the husband began to
    undermine the wife’s relationship with, and confidence in, Mr. Ross.  On
    June 18, 1996, Mr. Ross received a message from Ms. Bales’ secretary informing
    him of the husband’s instructions that Ms. Bales have no further communications
    with him.  Mr. Ross wrote to the wife advising her that the contract was “unconscionable” and
    expressing his concern that undue pressure was being put on her to sign the
    contract.  It would appear that the wife disregarded this advice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    Mr. Ross out of the picture and the wedding a few days away, Ms. Bales decided
    to ask Susan Heakes, a family law specialist with Blake, Cassels and Graydon,
    if she would provide independent legal advice to the wife.  On Tuesday, June
    18, 1996, Ms. Bales left a voicemail for Ms. Heakes requesting that she act
    for a wife on a marriage contract.  She explained that the wedding was on
    Saturday and that the wife wanted to see her on Thursday to have the contract
    explained.  Ms. Heakes agreed to act for the wife notwithstanding that the
    wedding was imminent because she was comfortable with Ms. Bales being on
    the other side and with the wife having had a previous lawyer.  Ms. Heakes
    had acted for Ms. Bales in her recent divorce.  This was not disclosed to
    the wife.  The wife testified that she was told by the husband that his lawyer
    had found another lawyer in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Toronto willing to let her sign the contract.</p>

    Heakes met alone with the wife for approximately one hour two days before
    the wedding.  During this meeting the wife’s disclosure statement was prepared
    and a change was made to the contract to reflect that the house deal had
    fallen through.  As such, the trial judge found that it was unlikely that
    the contract was reviewed in detail.  Ms. Heakes relied entirely on documents
    provided by Ms. Bales, which consisted of the same documents provided to
    Mr. Ross, as well as correspondence between counsel.  These documents contained
    the misrepresentations about the husband’s financial position.  She did not
    ask Ms. Bales to insert values for the husband’s assets into Schedule A.  Ms.
    Heakes did not appreciate that he model marriage contracts did not require
    the exclusion of business assets from equalization of net family property.  She
    testified that she did not remember if she reviewed with the wife the model
    marriage contracts contained in the Voting Trust Agreement and the Unanimous
    Shareholders Agreement.</p>

    marriage contract was signed on the day the wife met with Ms. Heakes.  The
    husband testified that up to the day the contract was signed, he was continuing
    to tell the wife that if the contract was not signed, there would be no marriage.  As
    the trial judge found, in the contract that was signed, the wife’s ability
    to claim spousal support, contrary to the model marriage contracts, was significantly
    compromised.  She gave up her right to share in the increase in value of
    virtually all of the husband’s assets without knowing the husband’s income
    from all sources, and without having any idea of his net worth.  Moreover,
    Ms. Heakes also did not possess this information at the time she provided
    legal advice to the wife for the purpose of signing the marriage contract.  Even
    though she testified that she would not advise a client without financial
    disclosure, she failed to request financial disclosure from Ms. Bales.  Consequently,
    Ms. Heakes was in no position to advise the wife in a meaningful way about
    the marriage contract.</p>

    trial judge thoroughly reviewed the evidence of the wife’s valuator, Linda
    Brent.  She accepted Ms. Brent’s evidence.  Using the midpoint, Ms. Brent’s
    opinion was that the net value of the husband’s business interests was $33,277,161
    at the date of the separation, and $14,664,500 at the date of the marriage.  The
    increase in value amounts to $18,612,661.  Based on the closing price of
    $14 a share on May 29, 2006, Ms. Brent estimated the value of the husband’s
    holding company to be $13 million.  According to the husband’s financial
    statement sworn on May 15, 2006, shortly before the trial, his personal assets
    totalled $2,112,700.  It is important to note that by the time of trial,
    there had been a sharp decline in the price of Wescast shares.  </p>

    his holding company to pay him the redemption amount  of his preference shares.  However,
    this would be limited to $6.3 million of the $9.3 million redemption amount
    because of a limiting provision in the company’s articles.  She thought that

    husband had breached his statutory obligation to provide financial disclosure
    to the wife.  She found that he didn’t make the required disclosure for two
    reasons.  First, he did not want his wife to know his income or the value
    of his assets because he wanted to control their lifestyle during marriage.  Second,
    he was afraid that full disclosure might lead to more aggressive demands
    and a less favourable contract.  Thus, the trial judge concluded that the

    judge determined that it was appropriate to set aside the marriage contract.  She
    recognized that it was appropriate to exercise that discretion not simply
    because of the failure to disclose, but also because of other factors relevant

    exercising discretion to set aside the marriage contract, the trial judge
    rejected the husband’s position that even though he failed to disclose his
    assets, the wife would have signed the contract in any event because she
    was intent on marrying him.  At paragraph 226, the trial judge commented:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is submitted on behalf of the husband that regardless
    of what his net worth and income were and regardless of whether there were
    misrepresentations about his finances, they were not material as the wife
    would have signed the contract anyway.  It is clear that the wife wanted
    to get married and that the husband was insisting that the contract be signed
    before getting married.  The wife stated on cross-examination that no matter
    what number was in the husband’s Schedule A, that she was going to sign the
    contract because she wanted to get married and “because she was signing this
    contract to protect Bruce’s interest in Wescast.”  I find that the wife was
    acknowledging that she understood that there would be no marriage without
    a marriage contract.  I do not agree that she was acknowledging that she
    would sign any contract regardless of its terms and regardless of the extent
    of her future husband’s income and assets.  She was prepared to “protect
    Bruce’s interest in Wescast.”  I find that she understood that the contract
    did this because of her future husband’s misrepresentations.  Had the husband
    disclosed the value of his assets and his income, this would have given the
    wife’s lawyers an opportunity to negotiate provisions less onerous to the
    wife.  I find that had he fully disclosed as required, it is likely that
    the marriage contract would have been more favourable to the wife, or that
    the wife, recognizing how unfair it was, would have refused to sign it.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    set aside the marriage contract, the trial judge was then required to determine
    how to properly equalize the parties’ net family property.  She relied on
    the evidence of the wife’s valuator to determine the husband’s net family
    property to be $20,654,416.52 and that of the wife to be $211,298.45.  She
    held that the equalization payment by the husband to the wife would be $10,221,559.04.  The
    husband argued that under s. 5(6)(g) and (h) of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> there should be an unequal payment.  He stated that in the circumstances
    it would be unconscionable to equalize the net family properties.  He relied
    on the decrease in value of the Wescast shares and the terms of the marriage
    contract.  He submitted that given the restrictions on the transfer of the
    Wescast shares, it would be unconscionable to place any value on the shares
    other than their current value.  The husband further submitted that any equal
    division would result in his entire net worth being given to the wife, which
    would be unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wife’s position was that it is the value of the net family properties on
    the valuation date, in this case, the date of separation, that is determinative.  As
    it is to be expected that market values or conditions will have changed from
    the date of separation to the date of trial, this cannot be said to be unconscionable.  Counsel
    for the wife submitted that if the decrease in value of Wescast shares was
    relevant, then only the decrease that occurred after the husband could reasonably
    have sold his shares should be considered, as he must assume responsibility
    for any loss arising from his delay in failing to sell his shares.  Counsel
    for the wife told the court that if the contract was set aside, the wife
    was willing to accept an equalization payment of $5.3 million.  He stated
    that it would not be unconscionable to require the husband to pay approximately
    50 per cent of the equalization payment calculated by Ms. Brent and accepted

    trial judge considered the more difficult issue to be whether a decrease
    in net family property that is solely market driven and not caused by a party’s
    conduct falls within s. 5(6)(h).  No case was provided by counsel on whether
    such a decrease has been recognized as a basis for unconscionability under
    s. 5(6)(h).  The trial judge developed the conclusion that s. 5(6)(h) was
    not engaged on the facts of this case.  In reaching this determination, she
    relied on the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s 1993 <i>Report on Family Law</i>,
    that expressed the view that s. 5(6) did not authorize the court to consider
    post-valuation date fluctuations in value of net family property, and that
    recommended that the <i>FLA</i> be amended to provide such authorization. </p>

    this conclusion, the trial judge went on to consider <i>what her view would
    have been</i> if the decrease in the value of the Wescast shares could have
    been the basis for a finding of unconscionability under s. 5(6).  At paragraph
    270, she concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The husband did not do a valuation of his net worth
    at the date of separation or trial.  Ms. Brent’s rough estimate of the husband’s
    net worth at trial was approximately $15 million.  This is a heavily discounted
    value.  An equalization payment of $10 million would leave the husband with
    substantially less in value than the wife.  In my opinion, this result shocks
    my conscience and I find it unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then proceeded to calculate an unequal division of the parties’ net
    family property on the ground of unconscionability notwithstanding her finding
    that s. 5(6) did not apply.  The trial judge adopted counsel for the wife’s
    submission that the correct approach is to fix an amount that is closest
    to the equalization payment in the particular circumstances of the case.  This
    was in contrast to the approach advanced by the husband’s counsel, who argued
    that the court should determine the variation based on principles of “fairness”,
    approaching the matter from an equitable perspective.  At paragraph 274,
    the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my respectful opinion, Mr. Epstein’s submission
    [counsel for the wife] is more consistent with the Act.  Instead of imposing
    one’s own assessment of fairness, the court determines when unconscionability
    ends.  In this way, the basic principle of equal division is only departed
    from to the extent necessary to avoid unconscionability.  Many equal divisions
    may be unfair. But, unless unconscionable, these are operative.</p>

    influenced by the wife’s compromise offer to accept approximately one half
    of the equalization payment to which the trial judge found she was entitled,
    at paragraph 275 the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, $5.3 million which is all that is
    requested, is not unconscionable.  I base this conclusion on the fact that
    the shares did not decrease in value immediately.  The husband could have
    protected himself by a disposition.  He chose not to.  Placing the entire
    loss on the wife would be unfair.  Sharing it more or less equally results
    in a net family property of $5,000,000 plus the house or $5.3 million.</p>

    Child Support Guidelines, she ordered that he pay support for the two children
    in the monthly amount of $4,544.  She further found, on the basis of Ms.

    support.  She awarded $6,640 a month, and provided a formula for its reduction,

    will now address the two main issues involved in the appeal, followed by
    the remaining issues.  First, I will consider whether the trial judge erred
    in setting aside the marriage contract in accordance with s. 56(4) of the <i>FLA</i>.  As
    for the second, the court was asked to articulate the proper approach to
    the unequal division of net family property under s. 5(6)(h) of the Act.  As
    I will explain, in my view it is not appropriate to consider this question
    given that the trial judge found that s. 5(6) was not engaged.  How the trial
    judge was able to make an unequal division in these circumstances is not
    entirely clear from her reasons.  In any event, as I understand the husband’s
    appeal, it is contended that the trial judge erred in the amount awarded
    to the wife on an unequal division of the parties’ net family properties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section

    of marriage agreements: <i>Hartshorne v. Hartshorne, </i>[2004] 1 S.C.R.
    550 at paragraph 14. The provision is of such significance that, in accordance
    with s. 56(7), it cannot be waived by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    analysis undertaken under s. 56(4) is essentially comprised of a two-part
    process: <i>Demchuk v. Demchuk </i>(1986), 1 R.F.L. (3d) 176 (Ont. H.C.J.).
    First, the court must consider whether the party seeking to set aside the
    agreement can demonstrate that one or more of the circumstances set out within
    the provision have been engaged. Once that hurdle has been overcome, the
    court must then consider whether it is appropriate to exercise discretion
    in favour of setting aside the agreement. This approach was adopted and applied
    by the trial judge in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed, the issue of focus at trial was whether the husband had complied
    with his financial disclosure obligation under s. 56(4)(a).  In <i>Patrick
    v. Patrick</i> (2002), 112 A.C.W.S. (3d) 302 (S.C.J.), the husband failed
    to disclose either the existence or value of his RRSPs prior to entering
    into a marriage contract. At trial, the husband argued that his failure to
    disclose was immaterial, since the RRSPs were not to be shared at any time,
    regardless of their value. Mesbur J. rejected this argument, noting at para.
    53 that “parties are not permitted to contract out of the obligation to disclose” and
    ordered that the contract be set aside for failure to make financial disclosure
    in accordance with s. 56(4)(a). In reaching this conclusion, at para. 52
    the trial judge emphasized the importance of ensuring that parties have a
    full understanding of their rights before entering into such contracts:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Marriage contracts are a device by which parties
    can opt out of most or part of the <i>Family Law Act, </i>its property provisions,
    its support provisions, or both. Fundamental to a choice to opt out of the
    legislative scheme is a clear understanding of what one’s rights and obligations
    might be if there were no marriage contract. It is in this context that financial
    disclosure is critical.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view is reinforced in <i>Dubin v. Dubin </i>(2003), 34 R.F.L. (5th) 227 at
    para. 32 (Ont. S.C.J.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…knowing assets and liabilities at the date of
    the agreement is fundamental to an eventual calculation of net family property.
    A party needs to know what asset base might potentially grow, in order to
    determine what he or she is being asked to give up in the agreement. Coupled
    with financial disclosure is the notion of understanding legal rights and
    obligations under the legislative scheme. This second notion carries with
    it the concept of independent legal advice. Thus, a party must know what
    assets and liabilities exist at the date of the contract, and must understand
    the general legislative scheme in order to know what he or she is giving
    up in the proposed agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the disclosure provided by the husband was insufficient to enable
    the wife to have a clear understanding of exactly what rights she was giving
    up by entering into the contract.  The husband failed to disclose that he
    held shares in Grannyco and RWL, which were found to be of significant value.  He
    failed to provide any financial statements for Grannyco, RWL or the Family
    Trust.  No income tax returns were provided for the husband and there was
    no disclosure whatsoever of his income.  Overall, the information provided
    by the husband made it impossible to calculate or determine his net worth.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    he disclosed his interest in “significant assets”
    such as the LeVan Companies and the LeVan Family Trust, he failed to disclose
    values for these interests.  At trial, the husband’s interest in the Family
    Trust was valued at $3.4 million at the date of marriage.  The trial judge
    found that the husband’s disclosure obligation required him to disclose the
    value of these significant assets.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the husband argued that the trial judge erred in importing the word “value” into
    section 56(4)(a), contrary to the plain wording of the section. He noted
    that the term “value” is used extensively throughout other parts of the statute.
    Thus, the legislature is presumed to have expressly excluded “value” from
    s. 56(4). In addition, the husband submitted that it would be onerous and
    expensive to require valuations for marriage contracts and would often result
    in parties making estimates of values, thereby creating a risk of misrepresentation,
    which in itself could be a basis to set aside the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge relied on the decision in <i>Demchuk v. Demchuk </i>(1986), 1
    R.F.L. (3d) 176 (Ont. H.C.J.) in support of her conclusion that the disclosure
    obligation under s. 56(4)(a) encompasses an obligation to disclose the <i>value </i>of
    the assets.  There is no case law that supports the husband’s position that
    the positive obligation required by s. 56(4)(a) can be met by providing only
    a list of significant assets without some indication of value being attributed
    to them.  Having said this, I note that the trial judge did not engage in
    a detailed statutory interpretation of the absence of the term “value” from
    the provision.  As such, I see no reason to engage in such an analysis here.  Moreover,
    the trial judge’s findings of fact which I have outlined in paras. 34 and
    35 fully support her decision to set aside the marriage contract, essentially
    on the basis of the husband’s reprehensible conduct leading to the signing
    of the marriage contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, it is my view that the husband’s failure
    to disclose value for his interests in the LeVan Companies and the Family
    Trust is not critical to the disclosure analysis.  As the trial judge indicated
    in her findings, there is an abundance of evidence indicating that the husband
    had failed to comply with his disclosure obligation apart from his failure
    to disclose value for these assets.  As discussed, this failure was compounded
    by the serious misrepresentations respecting the extent and value of certain
    of the assets disclosed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the marriage contract itself was misleading.  Ms. Bales incorporated
    the terms of the model marriage contract under the Voting Trust Agreement
    which stipulated the method of valuation of the LeVan company shares for
    the purpose of a property or support claim.  As admitted by Ms. Bales, someone
    reading this agreement might believe that it contemplated a valuation of
    the shares in the LeVan family companies.  These facts coupled with the wife’s
    misunderstanding about the effect of the contract meant that the wife had
    no chance whatsoever of understanding what she was giving up when she signed
    the contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    upon the trial judge’s twelve findings of fact that I have outlined, she
    properly exercised her discretion to set aside the contract for failure to
    comply with s. 56(4)(a).  In deciding how to exercise discretion, the trial
    judge considered the “fairness” of the contract.  The appellant emphasizes
    that unfairness in a contract is not a proper basis for setting aside marriage
    contracts in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Although there is nothing in the governing legislation
    that suggests that fairness is a consideration in deciding whether or not
    to set aside a marriage contract, I do not see why fairness is not an appropriate
    consideration in the exercise of the court’s discretion in the second stage
    of the s. 56(4)(a) analysis.  In my view, once a judge has found one of statutory
    preconditions to exist, he or she should be entitled to consider the fairness
    of the contract together with other factors in the exercise of his or her
    discretion.  It seems to me that a judge would be more inclined to set aside
    a clearly unfair contract than one that treated the parties fairly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this was not the only reason the trial judge articulated in support of her
    decision to set aside the contract.  As I have stated, in exercising her
    discretion, the trial judge also made the following findings: (i) the husband
    had interfered the wife’s lawyer of choice; (ii) the wife’s lawyers were
    unable to appreciate the consequences of the contract and impart them to
    the wife due to lack of financial disclosure and misrepresentations; (iii)
    the wife had not received effective independent legal advice and some advice
    provided was wrong; and (iv) the wife did not understand the nature or consequences
    of the contract she signed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings are reasonably supported by the evidence presented at trial.  I
    therefore see no reason to interfere with them in this case.  In essence,
    the trial judge found that the husband failed to make full disclosure of
    his significant assets, that his disclosure was incomplete and inadequate
    and that his failure to make full disclosure was a deliberate attempt to
    mislead his wife.  As such, the trial judge’s decision to set aside the contract
    should be upheld. </p>

    5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act </i>empowers the court to award a spouse an
    amount that is more or less than one-half the difference between their net
    family properties where the court is of the view that equalization would
    be unconscionable. The court’s authority to order unequal division is severely
    restricted to those circumstances that are “unconscionable” and that fall
    within the specific circumstances set out in clauses (a) through (h) of s.

    this case, the husband advanced the argument at trial that sections 5(6)(g)

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the trial judge concluded that s. 5(6)(g) was not applicable since
    the marriage contract had been set aside in its entirety. I agree with that
    view. Section 5(6)(g) was not designed to include a marriage contract that
    has been set aside by the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    finding that the significant decline in the value of the husband’s shares
    after separation was not a circumstance warranting unequal division within
    the meaning of s. 5(6)(h), the trial judge stated the following at para.
    267:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Legislature chose a specific day for valuation.
    Increases and/or decreases after this day will frequently occur. Some of
    these will be large. The longer the delay between valuation day and the trial
    date, the more likely that fluctuations may occur. I recognize that the threshold
    of unconscionability is a high one, but had the Legislature intended that
    post valuation date increases and decreases in value might form the basis
    of a s. 5(6) application, I think it likely, given the frequency of these
    events, that it would have included a provision to this effect.</p>

    the lower net family property becomes an unsecured creditor of the spouse
    with the higher net family property in the amount of the equalization payment.  </p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    rationale behind the trial judge’s finding in this case finds support in
    the decision of <i>Warne v. Warne </i>(1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 571 (Gen. Div.),
    in which Walsh J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the carefully crafted complex property scheme
    propounded in Part I of the Act, dependant as it is on events prior to separation,
    it is difficult to conceive that the legislature, without so specifically
    providing, intended one subsection thereof, s. 5(6)(h) to entirely change
    this scheme and permit consideration of post-separation events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view has since been adopted in a number of cases. In <i>Kelly v. Kelly </i>(1986),
    50 R.F.L. (2d) 360 (Ont. H.C.J.), the court held that a decline in the value
    of farmlands post-separation was not a circumstance that warranted unequal
    division. The court noted that “other circumstances” within the meaning of
    s. 5(6)(h) were circumstances relating to pre-valuation date circumstances.
    This view was also adopted in <i>Arndt v. Arndt </i>(1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 97
    (Gen. Div.), <i>Skrlj v. Skrlj</i> (1986), 2 R.F.L. (3d) 305 (Ont. H.C.J.),
    and <i>Heon v. Heon</i> 91989), 69 O.R. (2d) 758 (Ont. H.C.J.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Arndt</i>,
    Conant J. stated at page 5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am mindful and have considered s. 5(6) of the <i>Family
      Law Act</i>, 1986 as to unequal payment.  Although the market has considerably
      declined since the valuation date, a declining market is not one of the
      factors set out in s. 5(6) and I am not empowered to vary the equalization
      payment on that basis.  In <i>Kelly v. Kelly v. Kelly</i> (1986), 50 R.F.L.
      (2d) 360 (Ont. H.C.J.), Potts J. was of the view that s. 5(6) refers to
      circumstances in existence prior to, or as of the date of separation.  He
      seriously doubted that, even if a decrease in the value of property after
      separation created an unconscionable result, one could vary the equalization
      payment under s. 5(6).  At p. 366, he stated the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>…even if I had decided that it was unconscionable,
    I seriously doubt that s. 5(6) has any application because valuation is determined
    as of the date of separation and “debts or other liabilities” mentioned in
    para. (f) and “other circumstances” mentioned in para. (h) refer to debts
    or other liabilities and other circumstances in existence prior to, or as
    of, the date of separation.  There are no transitional provisions in the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> which would apply in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Accordingly, there will be no adjustment for
    declining prices of real estate under that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  While both the majority and the dissenting reasons offer some support
    for the position of Conant J., in my view it cannot be said that the issue
    was decided by this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, in <i>Serra v. Serra </i>(2007), 36 R.F.L. (6th) 66 (Ont. S.C.J.),
    Herman J. refused to impose an unequal division under s. 5(6)(h) where the
    value of the husband’s business had declined significantly after separation.
    The trial judge noted the following at paras. 134 &amp;135:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Turning to the language of s. 5(6)(h) itself, a
    market-driven decline in value does not appear to come within the “acquisition,
    disposition, preservation, maintenance or improvement” of a property. This
    is to be contrasted to a situation in which the conduct of a spouse had an
    impact on the value of the property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the circumstances in which a court
    may order an unequal division of net family property under s. 5(6) do not
    include a market-driven decline in the value of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the courts have not fully rejected the possibility of considering post-separation
    circumstances under s. 5(6). On some occasions, courts have interpreted s.
    5(6) as permitting the adjustment of the equalization payment in light of <i>all</i> circumstances
    existing at the time the case is decided. See the brief endorsement in <i>Merklinger
    v. Merklinger </i>(1996), 26 R.F.L. (4th) 7 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Such approach clearly suggests that the court may account for post-valuation
    date events in considering the application of s. 5(6). This approach was
    also adopted in the following cases: <i>Davies v. Davies </i>(1988), 13 R.F.L.
    (3d) 278 (Ont. H.C.); <i>McCutcheon v. McCutcheon </i>(1986), 2 R.F.L. (3d)
    327 (
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Ont. Dist. Ct.); <i>Perrin v. Perrin </i>(1988), 17 R.F.L. (3d) 87 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Ont. Dist. Ct.); and <i>Macedo v. Macedo </i>(1996), 19 R.F.L. (4th) 65 (Ont.
    Gen. Div.). However, it is important to point out that in each of these cases,
    the court’s decision to order an unequal division under s. 5(6) was related
    to the conduct of one of the spouses post-separation, or, in the case of <i>Perrin, </i>related
    to the medical condition of the wife post-separation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    there does seem to be room within s. 5(6) to consider post-separation circumstances
    in limited situations, such as where the conduct of one spouse post-separation
    has resulted in a significant depletion of assets.  Nevertheless, the cases
    that have considered post valuation date fluctuations in a spouse’s net family
    property are uniform that this factor does not come within the stipulated
    grounds in s. 5(6).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  However, in the context of this case, for the
    reasons that follow, I am of the view that it is not appropriate in this
    case to consider the decrease in the value of the husband’s assets subsequent
    to the valuation date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it is as a result of the husband’s misrepresentations and his own conduct
    in failing to provide proper financial disclosure that has put him into the
    situation of having his property and the value of the shares subject to the
    equalization provisions of the <i>FLA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as determined by the trial judge, the husband could have disposed of his
    shares to hedge against the setting aside of the contract, but he chose not
    to do so.  In making this determination, the trial judge considered the evidence
    of the legal experts, Tim Youdan and Michael Disney of Davies, Philips, Vineberg,
    who produced a report that provided that the husband had no ability to directly
    sell the Wescast shares.  At para. 243, the trial judge makes the following
    finding in this regard:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept [the evidence of Ms. Brent] that
    “prohibited transfer” in the Youdan report does not mean that a sale of the
    husband’s shares cannot occur.  Rather, it is a defined term that triggers
    the right of first refusal by the siblings and then a conversion of the shares
    into Class A shares.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also accepted the evidence of Ms. Brent that the husband had
    the right to redeem his preference shares in RyVan at any time, and that
    the right of first refusal by his family created a market and some liquidity.  There
    was also evidence that Wescast shares could be sold through secondary offerings
    and through
    “bought deal” arrangements with institutional investors.  In my view, it
    is not unconscionable to force the husband to bear the consequences of his
    choices in light of the trial judge’s finding that “[t]he husband could have
    protected himself by a disposition.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    no one would suggest that any ordinary creditor share the burden of a debtor’s
    reversal of fortune.  For all other purposes, including bankruptcy, the wife
    is treated as an ordinary unsecured creditor.  The application of this rule
    is consistent with the common law in relation to publicly traded shares.  When
    there is a breach of contract and shares of a publicly traded company are
    involved, Lord Wrenbury’s decision in <i>Jamal v. Moolla Dawood, Sons &amp; Co.</i>,
    [1916] 1 A.C. 175 (Judicial Committee of the Privy Council) has been consistently
    applied.  Lord Wrenbury says at p. 179, if the seller retains the shares
    after the breach, the speculation as to the way the market will subsequently
    turn is the speculation of the seller, not of the buyer; the seller cannot
    recover from the buyer the loss below the market price at the date of the
    breach if the market falls, nor is he liable to the purchaser for the profit
    if the market rises. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would not interfere with the trial judge’s finding that
    s. 5(6) is not engaged on the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband did not challenge the $5.3 million equalization payment on the ground
    that the trial judge exceeded her authority in ordering an unequal division
    of the net family properties once she found that none of the circumstances
    in s. 5(6) of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> were engaged.  It is to be recalled that after reaching this conclusion,
    she went on to consider <i>what her view would have been</i> if the decrease
    in value of the Wescast shares could have been the basis for a finding of
    unconscionability under s. 5(6).  It would, however, appear that the trial
    judge would have found that an equalization payment of $10 million was unconscionable
    as it would leave the husband with substantially less in value than the wife.  However,
    it is significant that the ultimate equalization payment of $5.3 million
    ordered by the trial judge was a result of the wife’s compromise proposal
    to accept that amount as conveyed by her counsel during argument, being an
    amount that counsel and the trial judge felt was not unconscionable.  I can
    find no reason other than the wife’s compromise for the trial judge’s award
    of an unequal division of the net family properties.  This was the reason
    the trial judge awarded an unequal equalization payment, a result that clearly
    benefited the husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the trial judge had authority under the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> to make this award, which I doubt, was not raised by either party
    as a ground of appeal.  Rather, the husband challenged the $5.3 million payment
    on the ground that he could not afford to pay this amount.  However, having
    found that s. 5(6) was not engaged, the trial judge could not have been criticized
    had she awarded the wife an equalization payment of $10 million on the basis
    of Ms. Brent’s calculations.  As I have indicated, the husband received a
    substantial benefit when the trial judge reduced the equalization payment
    to $5.3 million.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the parties presented substantial trial submissions on the proper approach
    to an unequal division to net family properties when s. 5(6) is engaged.  As
    I have indicated, as s. 5(6) was not engaged, it would not be appropriate
    to deal with this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I would not vary the equalization payment of $5.3 million.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>XII</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining grounds of appeal allege error on the part of the trial judge in
    awarding child and spousal support based on the husband’s income of $370,000
    for the year 2005, and in awarding post-judgment interest on the equalization
    payment of $5.3 million and on the retroactive support of $163,340 payable
    to the wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge did not err in awarding child support and spousal
    support on what was an essentially imputed annual income of the husband for
    2005 of $370,000 as determined by the wife’s valuator, Ms. Brent.  In <i>Hickey
    v. Hickey</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518 at paras. 10-12 the Supreme Court held
    that appeal courts should not overturn support orders unless the trial judge’s
    reasons disclose an error in principle, a significant misapprehension of
    the evidence or that the award is clearly wrong.  In my view, the husband
    failed to demonstrate any of these factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband did not produce an income report, nor did his counsel cross-examine
    Ms. Brent on her income report.  The trial judge was entitled to accept Ms.
    Brent’s calculation.  I would not interfere with the trial judge’s awards
    of child and spousal support based on an imputed 2005 income of $370,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the wife’s entitlement to post-judgment interest, the trial judge ordered
    that the equalization payment and the retroactive spousal support payment
    be paid over a period of about two years.  She did so not on the basis that
    the husband lacked the present ability to pay, but on the basis of the wife’s
    concession and because it was a reasonable period of time for the husband
    to liquidate his stocks.  Where equalization payments are payable over a
    period of years, the courts award post-judgment interest as a matter of course.  In <i>Koiter
    v. Koiter</i>, (1996) 67 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1152 at para. 22 (Ont. Gen. Div.),
    the court noted that “it should be the rule, rather than the exception” that
    an equalization payment attracts interest.  To do otherwise would effectively
    alter the amount of the equalization payment found owing in the first place,
    due to the time value of money.  Therefore, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>XIII</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.  Counsel
    for the respondent has ten days from the release of these reasons to make
    brief submissions in respect to costs.  Counsel for the appellant will have
    seven days to reply.</p>
