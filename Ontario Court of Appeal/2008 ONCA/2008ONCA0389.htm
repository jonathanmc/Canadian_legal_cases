    is an appeal, with leave of this court, from the trial judge’s order pursuant
    to rule 76.13(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, depriving the appellant
    of his costs in a personal injury action on the ground that it was not reasonable
    for the appellant to commence or continue the action outside of the Rule
    76 simplified procedure regime. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s action was for damages for personal injury arising out of a motor
    vehicle accident.  The respondents disputed both liability and damages.  The
    appellant alleged that he had sustained a mild traumatic brain injury and
    that he had ongoing and constant lower back pain arising from soft tissue
    injuries.  The trial proceeded before a judge and jury for eight days.  In
    addition to his own evidence and that of other lay witnesses, the appellant
    called his family doctor and three expert witnesses in the areas of neurology,
    psychology, and orthopaedics.  Those experts supported the appellant’s claims
    of mild brain injury and back pain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents called expert evidence to dispute the appellant’s claim and alleged
    that the appellant’s complaints arose largely, if not entirely, from pre-existing
    injuries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff also asserted a claim for lost income, but by the time the case
    went to the jury, the basis for that claim had evaporated and the jury was
    only asked to consider the claim for general damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s trial counsel asked the jury to return an award of $100,000 to
    $120,000 for general damages.  Defence counsel submitted to the jury that
    no general damages had been established. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(2) The trial judge’s instruction to the jury</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You are not
    bound to accept the plaintiff’s suggestion, nor to accept what I suggest
    to you, or what the defendant’s counsel has suggested.  You, and you alone,
    will determine the amount you conclude is fair to both parties.  In my view,
    a range of somewhere between 25,000 to 65,000 to 75,000 is open to you.  The
    upper range is open to you if you accept the plaintiff’s view of his case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel objected on the basis that the trial judge might have given the jury
    the impression that it could not go below $25,000.  The trial judge brought
    the jury back and gave the following further instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>… I told you that in my view a range of 25,000 to 65,000 to
    70,000 is open to you.  The upper area of that range is open to you if you
    accept the plaintiff’s view of the case, including the various items that
    I mentioned, the cognitive issues resulting from the concussion, back pain
    continuing, some limitation in future options of employment, and changes
    in his lifestyle and personality.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>If you do not accept some or all of these conditions as being
    caused or materially contributed to by the March 20, 2001 accident, as I
    said the assessment should be accordingly reduced, and I did not suggest,
    by using the figure 25,000 to give you any impression there is a floor here.
    It is just simply my opinion.  And it is a range based on whatever findings
    you may make.  All I am suggesting is that it would have to be reduced if
    you did not accept some or all of the plaintiff’s view of things as I have
    stated.  And if you do not accept some or all of those conditions, then,
    of course, some reduction would have to be made from the upper range, and
    it could go down below 25,000 depending on what you find. But I do want to
    indicate that this man—everybody agrees—suffered a concussion.  And whatever
    else is a problem or not is for you to decide based on the evidence.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(3) The trial judge’s threshold ruling</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the jury retired to deliberate, but before it returned with its verdict,
    the trial judge heard and ruled on the respondents’
    threshold motion, pursuant to the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8,
    s. 267.5(15), that the appellant had not suffered a permanent serious impairment
    of an important physical, mental or psychological function. The trial judge
    rejected the motion, ruling as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[R]elying heavily on the evidence of Dr. Kaminska and Dr. Ogilvie-Harris,
    by whom I was very impressed, and the plaintiff being sufficiently credible
    on the impact on his daily living, my ruling is this case meets the threshold.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(4) The jury’s verdict</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $20,000
    for general damages, leaving the plaintiff with a net recovery of only $5,000
    after applying the statutory deductible: <i>Insurance Act</i>, s. 267.5(7).
    However, it was common ground that pursuant to s. 267.5(9), costs fell to
    be determined on the basis of the award of $20,000.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that although the appellant’s counsel had been retained
    on a contingency fee basis, the appellant was entitled under the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15, s. 20.1(1), (2), to claim costs, as the contingency
    fee agreement provided for a percentage of the recovery “plus whatever party-and-party
    costs are recovered”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that either before or immediately after the action was
    commenced, “it was clear that the plaintiff had significant pre-accident
    conditions similar to or the same as his complaints in this case.”  The plaintiff’s
    own evidence had undercut that of his experts as to his loss of future job
    opportunities, and his economic loss claim was never substantiated. The trial
    judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The only viable
    claim well prior to trial was for non-pecuniary damage of less than $50,000
    realistically. It is true that the plaintiff survived the defendants’
    threshold motion, but the decision was very much a borderline case.  My estimate
    to the jury indicated a range of $25,000 to $65,000. The latter assumed that
    the plaintiff could be believed in his claims of severe, ongoing problems
    which was a question of fact for the jury, though the evidence for exceeding
    $50,000 was weakened by the plaintiff’s pre-accident complaints, no future
    income loss, and flat demeanour.  In addition to the plaintiff’s problems,
    at least one of the lay witnesses called on his behalf hurt his case regarding
    his actually playing golf considerably more than the plaintiff had said,
    a fact which could have been determined well before trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then went on to assess the appellant’s costs, in case his ruling
    with respect to entitlement was reversed on appeal.  The trial judge assessed
    the costs at $26,639.50 for fees and $20,519.44 for disbursements.</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises the following issue: Did the trial judge err by depriving the

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant must overcome two hurdles to succeed on this appeal.  The first
    is that costs are a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and an
    appellate court must accord the trial judge considerable deference.  Costs
    decisions turn on an assessment of the nature of the case and the conduct
    of the parties throughout the litigation, and trial judges are obviously
    in the best position to make that assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, appellate courts are entitled to intervene to ensure that costs decisions
    accord with the applicable legal principles that define and limit the range
    of discretion available to trial judges.  If the appellant can demonstrate
    an error in principle or that the decision was plainly wrong, he is entitled
    to succeed: <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd</i>., [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303
    at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second hurdle is that the costs consequences of Rule 76 are “the device that
    drives the whole system”: <i>Kincses v. 32262 B.C. Ltd.</i> (1998), 39 C.P.C.
    (4th) 384 at para. 13 (O.C.J. (Gen. Div.)), quoting Garry D. Watson &amp; Michael
    McGowan,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Civil Practice,</i> <i>1999</i> (Toronto:
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    Carswell, 1998) at 1144.  The purpose of the simplified procedure regime
    is to reduce legal costs and to enhance access to justice by making available
    a cheaper and more expeditious procedural regime appropriately geared to
    the litigation of modest claims.  That important purpose will be undermined
    if the costs sanctions built into the simplified procedure regime are not
    enforced.  On the other hand, rule 76.13 has a built-in safety valve, and
    provides that costs may be awarded even when a plaintiff recovers less than
    $50,000, if it was “reasonable” for the plaintiff to have commenced or continued
    the action under the ordinary procedure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I conclude that allowing the appellant to recover
    costs would not undermine the integrity of the Rule 76 simplified procedure
    regime, and that the appellant has demonstrated an error in principle that
    justifies appellate intervention. In my view, in the circumstances of this
    case, the trial judge’s conclusion that it was not reasonable for the plaintiff
    to have commenced and continued the action under the ordinary procedure cannot
    be reconciled with his pre-verdict assessment of the case, both in his charge
    to the jury and in his ruling on the defendants’ threshold motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury that if it accepted
    “the plaintiff’s view of the case”, the appropriate range of damages was
    between $25,000 and $70,000.  In light of that instruction, it could only
    have been unreasonable for the appellant to have commenced or continued the
    action outside the simplified procedure regime if the appellant, or his counsel,
    should have realized that there was no reasonable prospect that the jury
    would accept the appellant’s version. </p>

    trial judge himself had assessed the plaintiff’s case, albeit for the limited
    purpose of the threshold motion. The trial judge was “very impressed” by
    the appellant’s expert witnesses and he found that the appellant’s evidence
    was “sufficiently credible” to support a ruling that the appellant had suffered
    a permanent and serious impairment of an important physical, mental or psychological
    function as a result of the accident. Moreover, although the jury plainly
    did not entirely accept the appellant’s version of the case, neither did
    it accept the respondents’ view that the appellant had suffered no significant
    injury and that his claim was worth nothing. </p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    at face value the trial judge’s jury instruction and threshold ruling, I
    fail to see how it could not have been reasonable for the appellant to have
    commenced or continued the action under the ordinary procedure.  The reasonableness
    of the appellant’s decision to proceed under the ordinary procedure must
    be assessed on the basis of the facts as they existed before the jury’s verdict.  To
    proceed under the simplified procedure, the appellant would have to abandon
    any claim for more than $50,000 and forgo the opportunity to approach the
    case with the level of procedural rigour appropriate for a potentially significant
    claim.  The trial judge found that the appellant had impressive expert medical
    evidence and although the appellant’s credibility was plainly under dispute,
    the trial judge accepted his evidence as sufficiently credible to defeat
    the respondents’ threshold motion.  Jury verdicts in this area are notoriously
    difficult to predict and, as the trial judge himself recognized, had the
    jury accepted the appellant’s evidence, there was a realistic possibility
    of an award in excess of $50,000.  Moreover, in the end, the jury did accept
    at least part of the appellant’s evidence, as it returned a verdict in his
    favour. </p>

    fully recognizing that each case is to be decided on its own facts, I note
    that when ruling on the application of rule 76.13 to personal injury claims
    where the plaintiff has credible medical evidence to support a claim for
    an amount that exceeds the simplified procedure limit, other trial judges
    have taken a more generous approach: see <i>e.g. Branco v. Allianz Insurance
    Co. of Canada</i>, [2004] O.T.C. 1011 at paras. 7-8 (S.C.J.); <i>Wicken (Litigation
    Guardian of) v. Harssar</i> (2002), 24 C.P.C. (5th) 164 at paras. 13-15 (S.C.J.); <i>Snider
    v. Salerno</i>, [2002] O.T.C. 284 at paras. 8-13 (S.C.J.). </p>

    note that no appeal is taken from the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s
    costs should this court find that the trial judge erred in making his rule
    76.13 order.</p>

    these reasons, I would allow the appeal and allow the appellant his costs

    also entitled to his costs of both the application for leave to appeal and
    the appeal itself, which I would fix at $7,500 in total, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST. </p>
