    is an appeal by the Registrar, Ontario Motor Vehicle Dealers Act (the “Registrar”),
    the Motor Vehicle Dealers Compensation Fund (the “Fund”), John Doe and all
    other consumers or customers of the bankrupt HOJ National Leasing Corp. and
    HOJ National Leasing Inc. (collectively
    “HOJ”) from the order of Lax J. dated February 21, 2007, dismissing the appellants’ motion
    to vary the order of Colin Campbell J. dated January 26, 2005, and for an
    order granting the appellants leave to sue A. Farber &amp;
    Partners Inc. (the “trustee”) the trustee of the HOJ bankruptcy.  The appeal
    concerns the proper test for varying a bankruptcy order under s. 187(5) of
    the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”).  For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>II</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    fully understand the issues raised by the appeal, it is necessary to consider
    the background leading up to Campbell J.’s order, which is described in these
    proceedings as the “vesting order”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HOJ
    carried on business as two motor vehicle leasing companies.  Lessees of the
    motor vehicles, on entering into a lease, paid HOJ a deposit as security
    for damage to the vehicle, excess kilometres at the end of the lease term,
    or arrears of payments.  At the conclusion of the lease, HOJ was required
    to return the deposit less appropriate deductions, if any.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 27, 2004 HOJ filed voluntary assignments in bankruptcy naming A.
    Farber &amp; Partners Inc. as trustee in bankruptcy.  At that date, HOJ owned
    a lease portfolio in excess of 4,000 leases and conditional sales contracts,
    and customer security deposits exceeded $1.2 million.  On the date of bankruptcy,
    none of the customers were creditors of HOJ as none of the leases had matured
    entitling the customer to a return of all or part of his or her security
    deposit.  However, by December 13, 2006, the total amount of claims approved
    by the Registrar in respect of unpaid deposits owed by HOJ to its customers
    was $55,600.02.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HOJ
    financed its business through CFI Trust (“CFI”), to which HOJ’s lease portfolio
    had been assigned under an asset securitization agreement before the bankruptcy.  The
    agreement resulted in HOJ transferring the beneficial interest in the portfolio
    and associated vehicles to CFI in exchange for a payment by CFI of an amount
    equal to the present value of the cash flows that would be generated over
    time by the portfolio.  Under the agreement HOJ continued to administer the
    leases and conditional sales agreements, acting as collection agent for CFI.  Registration
    of the associated motor vehicles remained in the name of HOJ.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    following HOJ’s assignment into bankruptcy, CFI advised the trustee that
    any substantial delay in accessing the cash flow stream could cause it substantial
    financial harm since HOJ’s failure to pay CFI amounts owed under the terms
    of the agreements caused CFI to come under increased scrutiny by its credit
    rating agency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    bankruptcy, all of HOJ’s interest in the lease portfolio, being property
    of the bankrupt, devolved to the trustee.  In order to have the lease payments
    continue to be effectively collected after HOJ’s bankruptcy, CFI assigned
    the role of collection agent of the lease payments to Lease-Win Limited,
    Landmark Vehicle Leasing Corporation and North York Chevrolet Oldsmobile
    Limited (collectively
    “the assignees”).  It was a condition precedent of this assignment that a
    court order be obtained declaring that HOJ’s interest in the Portfolio was
    being assigned free and clear of any other claim, including any claim by
    a customer for the return of a security deposit.  In other words, the assignees
    required the vesting order as a condition to their assumption of the Portfolio
    since the Portfolio would otherwise create a net potential liability for
    the assignees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the timing and urgency of the request by CFI, the trustee moved for directions
    seeking, among other things, an order authorizing and directing the trustee
    to enter into an assignment agreement whereby HOJ’s interest in the assets
    in the Portfolio and the rights of HOJ in the Master Lease would be transferred
    to and vested in the assignees, free and clear of any claims, including claims
    for unpaid security deposits.  Although the motion for directions was returnable
    on October 18, 2004, it was not heard until January 26, 2005, when Campbell
    J. made the following order:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THIS COURT ORDERS THAT, forthwith upon the execution
    of the Assignment by the Trustee, the Trustee shall file a copy of the executed
    Assignment with this court and, upon such filing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       all the right, title and interest of
    the Bankrupt in and to the portfolio of leases, conditional sale contracts
    and underlying motor vehicles described in the Assignment, together with
    any and all related chattel paper, documents of title, goods, instruments,
    money and securities (the “Portfolio”) … shall vest in the assignee …, free
    and clear of any and all of the estates, titles, rights, benefits, interests,
    claims, liens, hypothecs, security interests, trusts or deemed trusts (whether
    statutory or otherwise), assignments, executions, judgments, options, agreements,
    rights of distress, legal, equitable or contractual set-offs, options, adverse
    claims, levies, agreements, taxes, disputes, debts, charges, mortgages, encumbrances,
    claims provable, including, without limitation, any claim to a customer deposit
    under an assigned lease, or any other rights or claims however arising …;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       all Claims in or to the Bankrupt’s interest
    in the Portfolio and the Program Agreements shall vest in place and in stead
    thereof in and to the cash proceeds actually received by the Trustee from
    the assignment thereof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Registrar and HOJ’s more than 4,000 lessees claimed that they did not receive
    notice of the trustee’s motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now explain how the Registrar became involved in these proceedings.  Under
    s. 12(1), found within the Schedule of R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 801, pursuant to
    s. 24(o) of the <i>Motor Vehicle Dealers Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.42, a
    fund was established to compensate customers of dealers in the circumstances
    stipulated by s. 12(3).  The fund is administered by the Registrar.  The
    relevant portion of s. 12(3) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       A customer may make a claim against the
    Fund where the customer gives written notice of the claim to the Registrar
    within two years of the participant’s refusal or failure to pay, even if
    the motor vehicle dealer with respect to whom the claim is being made ceased
    to be a participant after the refusal or failure to pay, and where the claim
    meets one of the following requirements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.           .           .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         The participant has become a bankrupt
    or a winding-up order has been made or a receiver appointed in respect of
    the business of the participant under the <i>Bankruptcy Act</i> (Canada)
    and the claim is for a liquidated amount and the customer makes an application
    that is supported by evidence of the allowance of the claim by the Trustee
    in bankruptcy, liquidator or receiver, less any amount that may have been
    paid on account of the claim by the Trustee, liquidator or receiver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HOJ
    is a “participant” within the meaning of s. 12(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    pursuant to the statutory scheme, the fund has a potential exposure of $1.2
    million for the return of the lessees’ security deposits.  The vesting order
    expressly provided that the assignment by CFI of HOJ’s lease portfolio did
    not impose HOJ’s contractual obligation to return the security deposits on
    the assignees.  As such, the Registrar, no doubt correctly, assumed that
    the fund would have to compensate the customers for the return of their deposits,
    the reality being that they would recover little or nothing from HOJ’s estate.  It
    was the Registrar’s view that the vesting order was wrong in exempting the
    assignees from any liability to the customers to return their deposits.  Thus,
    the Registrar decided to challenge the vesting order by means of a motion “to
    vary” the order, it being too late to appeal from the order.  The Registrar
    was purportedly joined in his motion by the over 4,000 customers of HOJ,
    although very little was said on their behalf by counsel for the appellants,
    who essentially presented his argument on the Registrar’s behalf.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Registrar claims to have become aware of the vesting order in early February,
    2005.  However, it waited until August, 2005, before issuing its notice of
    motion to vary.  Lax J. did not hear the motion until February 20, 2007.  The
    Registrar’s motion is brought as subrogee of the customers of HOJ pursuant
    to s. 14(3) of the Schedule to the Regulation.  The Registrar brought the
    motion pursuant to Rule 37.14 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194 and s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>.  As I will be referring to
    these provisions later, it is convenient to set them out.  Rules 37.14(1)
    and 37.14(2) provide in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>37.14 (1) A party or other person who,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       is <i>affected</i> by an order obtained
    on motion <i>without notice</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.           .           .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>may move to set aside or vary the order, by a notice
    of motion that is served forthwith after the order comes to the person’s
    attention and names the first available hearing date that is at least three
    days after service of the notice of motion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a motion under subrule (1), the court may set aside or vary the order on
    such terms as are just.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i> states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>187 (5)  Every court may review, rescind or vary
    any order made by it under its bankruptcy jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    3(a) of Campbell J.’s order expressly provided that the assignment “shall
    vest in the assignee … free and clear of …
    any claims to a customer deposit under an assigned lease”.  The Registrar’s
    motion to vary requested the deletion of this portion of paragraph 3(a),
    to be replaced by:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject nonetheless to the claims of customers
    regarding the return of customers’ deposits on the expiry of their leases
    and pursuant to the terms of the leases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the Registrar’s motion sought a substantive change to the order
    of Campbell J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Registrar also requested a declaration that HOJ’s customers had possessory
    liens against their vehicles as security deposits and that they are entitled
    to the return of their deposits in accordance with the terms of the leases.  The
    Registrar also requested a further declaration that the assignees are bound
    by the terms of the lease agreements made between HOJ and their customers
    for security deposits paid to HOJ.  Finally, the Registrar sought an order
    pursuant to s. 215 of the <i>BIA</i> granting him and the customers leave
    to commence an action against the trustee for damages arising out of the
    assign-ment of the leases.  As I have indicated, the motion judge dismissed
    the Registrar’s motion in its entirety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would note that Campbell J. also ordered that service of the notice of motion
    and motion record were validated and any further service of the motion record
    on the creditors of HOJ and “any other parties in interest” be dispensed
    with.  As well, he ordered that the trustee was authorized and directed to
    execute the assignment, which was appended to the order.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>III</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons for judgment, Lax J. noted that in advance of the trustee’s motion
    the Registrar had received notice of the First Meeting of Creditors at which
    the trustee was to present its Preliminary Report.  Although the Registrar
    failed to attend the meeting, it received the Report which disclosed that
    the trustee was bringing a motion for directions to permit it to assign HOJ’s
    interest in its portfolio of leases and conditional sales agreement to the
    assignees “free and clear of any and all claims”.  This resulted in the motion
    judge finding that “the Registrar had actual notice of the motion and did
    not seek to assert or protect its position in the face of this.”  She went
    on to find that “the Registrar clearly had notice of the purpose and effect
    of the assignment and the administrator of the Compensation Fund was informed
    and aware that the assignees were not taking responsibility for the security
    deposits.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge noted that the leases between the customers and HOJ provide
    that the obligation of the customers to make payments under the leases exists
    without regard to any claims for set-off that may be asserted against HOJ.  Consequently,
    the contractual obligation to refund security deposits under the leases remains
    a debt of the bankrupt HOJ.  Thus, the motion judge concluded that Campbell
    J.’s order “merely recognized the fact that under the leases, any assignee
    of HOJ would take an assignment of HOJ’s rights under the leases, but liability
    for [the return of] the deposits at all times remained with HOJ.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central
    to the motion was whether either the customers or the Registrar had standing
    to move to vary Campbell J.’s order and whether the trustee acted properly
    in seeking the direction of the court as to whether it should execute the
    assignment agreements.  The motion judge considered this issue from the perspective
    of Rule 37.14(1)(a), without any reference to s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>.  Following <i>Ivandaeva
    Total Image Salon Inc. v. Hlembizky</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 769 (C.A.),
    she held that on a Rule 37.14(1)(a) motion the moving party must establish
    that the order sought to be varied directly affects the rights of the moving
    party in respect of the proprietary or economic interests of the party.  She
    concluded that, while the <i>bankruptcy</i> changed the customers’ ability
    to recover the deposits from HOJ thereby affecting their economic or propriety
    interest, the <i>order</i> did not affect these interests, nor did it deprive
    the customers of any rights.  As the motion judge wrote: “The customers never
    had any rights to recover the deposits from the Assignees.  There is nothing
    improper in an Order that holds the lessees to their contracts.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge discussed at some length whether the trustee acted properly
    in seeking the court’s direction in respect to whether it should execute
    the assignment agreements.  In doing so, she pointed out that at the time
    of the bankruptcy, legal title to the vehicles was with HOJ, while the beneficial
    interest in the portfolio of leases had been assigned to CFI under an asset
    securitization agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    resolving this issue, the motion judge held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find nothing improper in the conduct of the Trustee
    in seeking direction from the court as to whether to execute the assignment
    agreements.  The Order it obtained, albeit at the behest of CFI, did nothing
    more than reflect the existing legal position of the lessees under their
    leases.  Nonetheless, the Trustee reserved its right under the Order to assert
    an interest in the proceeds realized form the portfolio by the Assignees
    and/or CFI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the Registrar was not affected by the vesting order, the
    motion judge wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no indication that the Legislature intended
    the customers to have any recourse other than their subrogated unsecured
    claims against the bankrupt dealer.  There is no indication the Legislature
    intended the Registrar to be able to assert subrogated claims against the
    Assignees.  There is no evidence that any customer, much less the Registrar,
    had any legitimate expectation of looking to the Assignees for payment of
    their deposits.  The Regulation structuring the Fund provides no statutory
    right of set-off for unpaid security deposits.  The thrust of the submissions
    of the moving party are to recognize such a right, disregarding the contractual
    terms of the leases and the Fund to which customers of a bankrupt dealer
    have recourse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the moving party has not established
    that it is affected by the order.  There is no basis for finding that the
    Order should not have been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also dismissed the Registrar’s request under s. 215 of the <i>BIA</i> for
    leave to commence an action against the trustee, concluding: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The claims that the moving party seeks leave to
    assert (negligence, abuse of process and unjust enrichment) depend upon the
    allegation that the customers suffered harm as a result of the actions of
    the Trustee in seeking the Order providing for the transfer of the portfolio
    to the Assignees.  Having concluded that the customers had no rights to set
    off claims for deposits against the Assignees and that the Order did not
    affect their rights or any subrogated rights of the Registrar, the record
    discloses no damages that may be asserted against the Trustee for allegedly
    depriving the customers of their deposits.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having found that the conduct of the Trustee in
    seeking court approval was a proper discharge of his duties, the claims for
    negligence and abuse of process cannot possibly succeed.  There can be no
    unjust enrichment in circumstances where the customers and Registrar suffered
    no deprivation.  It was submitted in argument that if the customers had received
    notice that resulted in the Order on January 26, 2005, they might have decided
    to withhold the return of the vehicles or their final lease payments pending
    return of their deposits.  To the extent it is argued that this is a deprivation,
    the Order does not prevent them from doing this, although it would appear
    that the terms of their leases may.</p>

    would add that since the hearing of this appeal, this court considered virtually
    the identical issue in <i>Re the Bankruptcy of Impact Tool &amp; Mould Inc.</i>,
    [2008] O.J. No. 962.  In this case the trustee in bankruptcy moved pursuant
    to s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i> to vary an order approving the sale of the
    bankrupt’s assets and a vesting order made on April 23, 2003 by Brockenshire
    J.  The motion to vary was heard more than four years after the original
    order.  It was dismissed on the basis of delay and because the trustee failed
    to establish any error or omission in the order.  In dismissing the trustee’s
    appeal, this court stated at para. 8 of its endorsement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We see no error in the motion judge’s conclusions.  Under
    s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>, a party may move to vary an order.  However,
    that section cannot be used purely for the purpose of bringing an appeal
    out of time: <i>Re Catalina Exploration &amp; Development Ltd.</i> (1981),
    121 D.L.R. (3d) 95 at 102-103 (Alta.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That is essentially what the trustee was attempting to do in this case.  No
    appeal was taken from the sale approval and vesting order issued on April
    23, 2003, although the trustee was appointed within a month of that date.  In
    an earlier matter on this bankruptcy that came before this court in 2006,
    the court noted that no appeal had been taken from the sale approval and
    vesting order: (2006), 79 O.R. 241 at para. 19.  The trustee is now seeking
    to appeal the order under the guise of a variation.  Eliminating a critical
    paragraph of a vesting order four or five years after the transaction took
    place is not a variation, and cannot be accomplished under s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i> or
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>IV</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge was correct in concluding that, given that their
    proprietary or economic rights were not directly affected by Campbell J.’s
    order, the Registrar and customers had no standing to move for a variation
    of that order under Rule 37.14(1)(a).  As well, I agree with the legal analysis
    on which she based her finding.  For the reasons given by the motion judge,
    I am also of the view that she was correct in rejecting the Registrar’s motion
    for leave to bring an action against the trustee.  Moreover, there are no
    palpable or overriding errors in her findings of fact.  In my view, the motion
    judge was also correct in rejecting the further relief sought by the Registrar
    which is outlined in paragraph 13 of my reasons.  I would, therefore, dismiss
    the appeal.  However, arising from this appeal I find that there are three
    matters that require comment that were not considered in the reasons of the
    motion judge, likely because they were not raised by counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Registrar’s motion is far removed from a proper motion to vary.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>V</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the first matter, the Registrar’s motion to vary the order of Campbell
    J. was brought pursuant to both rule 37.14(1)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> and s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>, which I have set out in paragraph
    11 of my reasons.  It would seem that the motion was argued and resolved
    on the application of rule 37.14(1)(a) whereas, properly, it was a s. 187(5)
    motion.  This is because the provisions of the <i>BIA</i> prevail.  As Rule
    3 of the <i>Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency General Rules</i>, C.R.C., c. 368,
    stipulates, resort may be had to the ordinary procedure of the relevant province
    only where the <i>BIA</i> or the Rules fail to provide the necessary procedure.  In
    this case, as s. 187(5) of the Act provided the necessary procedure, resort
    should not have been had to rule 37.14(1)(a).  This was pointed out during
    argument to counsel for the appellants, Mr. Bennett, who suggested that it
    made no difference whether the motion was argued under rule 37.14(1)(a) or
    s. 187(5) as the test for varying an order is the same under each provision.  I
    do not agree.  It is clear from the authorities that s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    and its predecessors, has its own jurisprudence, quite different from, and,
    in my view, more restrictive than the jurisprudence of rule 37.14(1)(a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    has been said that s. 187(5) is unique to insolvency in that it allows the
    court to review and rescind or vary an order made by a court of co-ordinate
    jurisdiction, and applies to any order made in the exercise of bankruptcy
    jurisdiction: <i>Fitch v. Official Receiver</i>, [1996] 1 W.L.R. 242 (C.A.),
    discussing s. 375(1) of the English <i>Insolvency Act 1986</i>, which is
    virtually identical to s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>.  However, unlike rule
    37.14(1), no conditions apply before resort can be had to s. 187(5).  As
    I will explain, a motion under s. 187(5) cannot be brought as a substitute
    for an appeal, such as when the time to appeal has expired.  An appeal is
    brought when it is believed that there is reversible error in the court below.  A
    motion under s. 187(5) is essentially different.  As the English Court of
    Appeal states in <i>Fitch</i> at p. 246, for the provision to apply, there
    must be a fundamental change in circumstances, between the original hearing
    and the time of the motion to vary, or evidence must have been discovered
    that was not known at the time of the original hearing and which could have
    led to a different result.  Or, as the leading Canadian case has put it,
    the court should not hear a motion under s. 187(5) if its only purpose it
    to obtain an opportunity to appeal where the time to appeal has elapsed: <i>Re
    Catalina Exploration and Development Ltd.</i> (1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 95
    (Alta. C.A.), rev’g (1980), 35 C.B.R. (N.S.) 30 (Alta. Q.B.).  By this motion
    and the appeal, the Registrar asks that the court rehear the trustee’s motion
    for directions and make another order in the place of the one already made,
    drawn up, entered and acted upon.  This, of course, the court cannot do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    thorough and instructive review of the jurisprudence of s. 187(5) is to be
    found in L.W. Houlden, G.B. Morawetz &amp; J. Sarra, <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Law of Canada</i>, 3rd ed., looseleaf, (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 1993)
    pp. 7-20.2 to 7-24.1; 7-31 to 7-32.  Among the principles governing the court’s
    application of s. 187(5), is that the jurisdiction given by s. 187(5) should
    be sparingly exercised.  Although s. 187(5) contains no time limit, because
    bankruptcy proceedings often take place in real time, a motion to vary should
    be made promptly: <i>1064521</i> <i>Ontario Ltd.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)
    407 (Gen. Div.).  Moreover, as the court should not consider a motion to
    vary an earlier order on the record, the moving party should bring forward
    new evidence of a substantial nature that was not available at the original
    hearing: <i>Re Strachan</i> (1980), 34 C.B.R. (N.S.) 136 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Ont.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C.).  See, also, Frank Bennett, <i>Bennett on Bankruptcy</i>, 10th ed.
    (Toronto CCH Canadian, 2008) pp. 461-62.  As McGillivray C.J.A. stated at
    p. 102 of <i>Re Catalina</i> in reference to the former s. 157(5) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    which is identical in wording to the existing s. 187(5):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the language of this section is broad, it
    seems to me that it is designed to permit of a Judge to deal with continuing
    matters in the bankruptcy so as not to be bound by an earlier decision if
    faced by changing circumstances.  Thus, while a Judge might approve the appointment
    of a trustee, he at a future date might alter that order by appointing more
    than one trustee or removing a trustee.  He might refuse a discharge to a
    bankrupt but later, having regard to circumstances then existing, vary that
    order so as to permit of a discharge on terms and he might again at a future
    date vary that order.  Similarly, the manner of remuneration might from time
    to time be subject to variation and review.  Against this, however, there
    is that type of case where a final adjudication has to be made.  The claim
    of one class of creditors over another has to have priority.  The question
    whether a particular piece of property forms part of the bankrupt’s estate,
    the validity of the claim or the amount of the claim, are all matters which
    should be the subject of a final adjudication in respect of which an appeal
    with leave would lie, but surely, adjudication of claims of that sort cannot
    be the subject of repeated applications.  There have been cases where an
    order disallowing a creditor’s claim has been reviewed, but new evidence
    was available and it was apparently very cogent evidence, but I am of the
    view that by and large claims capable of final determination should not be
    the subject of repeated applications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though the motion was dealt with pursuant to rule 37.14(1)(a) rather than
    under s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>, in my view, had it been resolved pursuant
    to s. 187(5) applying the principles discussed above, the result would have
    been the same.  The same analysis that the motion judge applied in determining
    that neither the Registrar nor HOJ’s customers were affected by Justice Campbell’s
    vesting order would apply.  Applying s. 187(5) jurisprudence, the motion
    to vary was not made expeditiously.  It was made long after the ten days
    in which to appeal had elapsed, giving rise to the inference that it was
    made because it was too late to bring an appeal.  Moreover, it was not supported
    by new evidence of a substantial nature that was unavailable at the original
    hearing.  Counsel for the appellants wanted the motion judge to rehear the
    motion heard by Campbell J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    liberal opportunities to appeal, our judicial system operates on the principle
    that final judgments are intended to be just that – final.  If judgments
    did not, in general, have finality, the consequences would be at least as
    serious as the fact that an injustice may have been done.  These consequences
    include the disturbance of the parties’ reliance on judgments and the erosion
    of the moral authority of the judicial system as final arbiter of legal disputes.  Related
    to this is how promptly the objection is raised, for the parties’ reliance
    on a judgment and the strength of the judgment’s moral authority are to an
    important degree a function of the length of time during which a judgment’s
    finality remains in limbo.  In this case, it was on September 27, 2004 that
    HOJ filed voluntary assignments in bankruptcy and named its trustee.  The
    trustee’s motion for directions of October 18, 2004 was heard by Campbell
    J. on January 26, 2005, when he made the vesting order.  The Registrar was
    aware of this order in early February, 2005.  However, he did not issue his
    notice of motion to vary until many months later, and a further year and
    a half elapsed before the motion was heard.  Thus, it has been two years
    since the assignees, the trustee and HOJ’s customers have acted in reliance
    on the reasonable view that Campbell J’s order was final and binding on all
    parties.  Yet the Registrar asks the court, at this late date, to dismantle
    everything that has taken place in reliance on that order.  This, in itself,
    would be reason enough to dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VI</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now discuss the second matter that is of concern.  This appeal is about
    who is liable to repay the security deposits paid by individual lessees to
    HOJ under the terms of their leases, and spent by HOJ before its bankruptcy.  It
    is clear that in the circumstances of this case, the primary responsibility
    to repay the deposits is that of HOJ, through its trustee in bankruptcy,
    from any surplus available after the administration of HOJ’s estate.  In
    reality, however, it will be the fund administered by the Registrar that
    will pay the lion’s share of the deposits pursuant to the regulatory scheme
    in the <i>Motor Vehicle Dealers Act</i>.  As the motion judge held, as a
    result of Campbell J.’s vesting order, the assignees are not legally liable
    to repay the deposits.  In my view, it is clear that by its motion to vary,
    and by this appeal, what the Registrar has attempted to do is avoid its statutory
    obligation to respond to the customers’ claims for the return of the security
    deposits and to pass this on to the assignees by a substantive change to
    the vesting order of Campbell J. that it sought to obtain first under the
    guise of a motion to vary, and now on this appeal.  Not only was the Registrar
    unable to accomplish this by its motion to vary for the reasons given by
    the motion judge, but it could not have done so because, in effect, it was
    asking the court to rewrite the statute.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VII</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    come now to the final matter of concern.  Both rule 37.14(1) and s. 187(5)
    of the <i>BIA</i> use the word “vary” in relation to varying or amending
    an order of the court.  In my view, counsel for the Registrar was misguided
    in believing that he could accomplish what he intended by persuading the
    court to vary Justice Campbell’s order.  As I have pointed out in paragraph
    12, the Registrar sought to replace that portion of the order that provided
    that the assignee had no obligation to return the customers’ security deposits
    with a provision requiring them to do so.  The Registrar attempted to persuade
    the motion court and this court to reopen the motion before Campbell J. and
    have the court consider issues that were neither actually nor constructively
    involved in the order that Campbell J. gave.  To do so and to substitute
    the change to Campbell J.’s order proposed by the trustee, would have made
    a substantive change to the original order.  This is not within the meaning
    or purpose of
    “vary”, whether in the context of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> or
    the <i>BIA</i>, where the term should have the same meaning.  As the few
    cases that have considered the meaning of “vary” indicate, the purpose of
    a rule empowering the court to vary or amend an order or judgment is to permit
    the court to rectify an order or judgment that fails to correctly state what
    the court actually decided or intended.  The use of a motion to vary is,
    therefore, strictly limited to such matters of clear oversight.  However,
    for the sake of completeness I should add that motions to vary are frequently
    properly used to correct clerical errors.  I am concerned only with the meaning
    of “vary” in the context of rule 37.14(1) and s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>,
    not with the circumstances that might prompt a motion to vary, such as an
    order or judgment granted on a motion without notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mitchell
      v. Sparling</i> (1909), 15 O.W.R. 37 (High Ct.), a motion was made to amend
      the formal judgment of the court by deleting a declaration that the parties
      were partners on the ground that this was not decided at trial.  In allowing
      the motion, Riddell J. stated at p. 38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Ainsworth v. Wilding</i>, [1896] 1 Ch. 673,
    discusses the prior cases and lays down the rule (inter alia) that “when
    the Court itself finds that the judgment, as drawn up, does not correctly
    state what the Court actually decided and intended,” the Court can, upon
    motion, interfere after the passing and entering of the judgment: see p.
    677.  That is the present case; and the judgment will be amended by omitting
    all reference to the subject-matter of the partnership.</p>

    J. expressed a similar view in <i>Broom v. Pepall</i> (1911), 23 O.L.R. 630
    (Div. Ct.), where he held that where an order correctly set out what the
    court actually decided and intended to decide, there is no power in the court
    to vary the order upon motion after the order has been formally issued.  In <i>Prevost
    v. Bedard</i> (1915), 51 S.C.R. 629, the Supreme Court of Canada was of a
    similar view.  It held that the power of the court to amend a judgment after
    it has become a record of the court is limited to making the record conform
    to the judgment pronounced or intended to be pronounced.  It does not authorize
    the recalling of the judgment in order to deal with a collateral matter not

    High Ct.), McRuer C.J.H.C. expressed the same opinion.  In doing so, he made
    extensive reference to the authorities.  I will refer to two passages from
    his reasons for judgment that set out the principles.  At p. 865 he referred
    to what he described as the leading case with reference to the court’s jurisdiction
    to control its own orders: <i>In re Swire: Mellor v. Swire</i> (1885), 30
    Ch. D. 239.  He reproduced the following passage from the judgment of Cotton
    L.J.:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But although that is the regular course, and it
    is only in special circumstances that the Court will interfere with an order
    which has been passed and entered, except in cases of a mere slip or verbal
    inaccuracy, yet in my opinion the Court has jurisdiction over its own records,
    and if it finds that the order as passed and entered contains an adjudication
    upon that which the Court in fact has never adjudicated upon, then, in my
    opinion, it has jurisdiction, which it will in a proper case exercise, to
    correct its record, that it may be in accordance with the order really pronounced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    at p. 868 McRuer C.J.H.C. added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Kidd v. National Railway Association</i> (1916),
    37 O.L.R. 381 at 387, 31 D.L.R. 354, Masten J. in precise language distinguishes
    between altering the substance and the form of the judgment: “To alter the
    substance of the judgment as pronounced by the Court, whether on account
    of mistake in content or otherwise, is one thing.  To alter the form of the
    judgment so as to make it conform to the decision of the Court is another.  The
    first is to relieve one party from consent given under a misapprehension.  The
    second is to effectuate the intention of the Court.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as there is no suggestion that Campbell J. made an order other
    than the one that the trustee requested and that he intended to pronounce,
    and in fact pronounced, the Registrar’s motion was far removed from being
    the proper subject matter of a motion to vary.  There is no power in rule
    37.14(1) or s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i> to grant the “variation”
    sought by the Registrar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dictionary
    definitions of language contained in a statutory instrument are sometimes
    helpful.  In consulting eight on-line dictionaries, I found that “vary” was
    consistently defined as “to alter, or be altered, in any manner” or “to modify
    or alter”.  The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2d ed. defines “vary” as
    to “make different; modify, diversify”.  In <i>Godfrey v. Ontario Police
    Commission</i> (1992), 5 O.R. (3d) 163 at 175 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.), in the context of a regulation authorizing the Ontario Police
    Commission to “vary the punishment imposed as it considers just”, Watt J.
    stated: “In common parlance and usage, to ‘vary’ means to cause to change
    or alter, to introduce changes or alterations into something.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also helpful to make a brief reference to the American counterpart to
    rule 37.14(1), Rule 59(e) of the <i>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to
    illustrate the similarity in the two provisions and to show that modern rules
    of civil procedure have a mechanism to vary previous orders in appropriate
    circumstances.  This rule provides for a motion to “alter or amend a judgment”.  It
    is noteworthy that the American rule uses the term “alter” rather than “vary”.  As
    I have noted, “alter” is the common dictionary meaning of “vary”.  As in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, the American rule contains no list of grounds for altering or amending
    a judgment, and case law has been left to fill that void.  The American case
    law acknowledges four grounds that justify altering or amending a judgment:
    to incorporate an intervening change in the law, to reflect new evidence
    not available at the time of the original hearing, to correct a clear legal
    error, and to prevent a manifest injustice.  Cases coming within these grounds
    include where the original judgment failed to provide for the relief that
    the court found a party entitled to receive.  See Steven Baicker-McKee, William
    M. Janssen and John B. Corr, <i>Federal Civil Rules Handbook 2008</i>, (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Minnesota: Thomson West, 2008) pp. 1026-27.  I believe that what the case
    law in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    illustrates is that the terms “alter” and “vary” are largely defined by the
    facts of the cases in which orders or judgments have been varied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, on a motion to vary, the jurisprudence clearly establishes that
    the court can rectify an order or a judgment that fails to correctly state
    what the court actually decided or ordered.  On a motion to vary, the court
    cannot, as the Registrar sought to do in its motion, substantively change
    the impugned order.  In this regard, the Registrar’s motion was doomed to
    fail from the outset.  Although the motion judge decided the motion on other
    grounds, she could have decided it on this ground.  As a matter of principle,
    in my view the term “vary” should be similarly interpreted under both rule
    37.14 and s. 187(5) of the <i>BIA</i>.  Moreover, considering the time requirement
    in rule 37.14(1) and the s. 187(5) jurisprudence, it is clear that a motion
    to rescind or vary an order or a judgment must be made expeditiously and,
    if possible, before the order or judgment has been acted on.  In this case,
    the Registrar’s motion to vary Campbell J.’s vesting order was heard more
    than two years after the order, which in the interim had been acted on by
    the assignees and by HOJ’s customers.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, in my opinion Lax J. properly dismissed the Registrar’s
    motion to vary the order of Campbell J. and properly exercised her discretion
    in refusing the Registrar leave to commence an action against the trustee.  The
    Registrar raised other grounds of appeal, none of which has any merit, which
    are outlined in paragraph 13 of my reasons.  I would, therefore, dismiss
    the appeal.  </p>

    which the unsuccessful appellant should be required to pay substantial indemnity
    costs.  I will explain what has brought me to this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is trite to say that all costs are in the discretion of the court which has
    the full power in all cases to determine by whom and to what extent costs
    are to be paid.  The discretion is exercised according to the circumstances
    of each particular case.  Because costs orders are discretionary, they are
    not considered to be precedential.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained in my reasons for judgment, the Registrar, under no circumstances,
    could have succeeded in his motion to vary Campbell J.’s order.  To put it
    bluntly, the motion was doomed to fail, as was the appeal to this court.  The
    respondents were obliged to defend both a hopeless motion and a hopeless
    appeal.  The court is entitled to take this into consideration in the exercise
    of its discretion.  In my view, the following passage from M.M. Orkin, <i>The
    Law of Costs</i>, 2nd ed., looseleaf (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2007),
    Vol. 1, p. 2-211 applies to this case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            There is, as well, a factor frequently
    underlying such an award, although not necessarily expressed, namely, that
    the circumstances of the case may be such that the successful party ought
    not to be put to any expense for costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.           .           .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            As well, an award of costs on the solicitor-and-client
    scale is an important device that the courts may use to discourage harassment
    of another party by the pursuit of fruitless litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the respondents have been put to needless expense, they are entitled to substantial
    indemnity costs.  I would fix costs as follows: CFI - $25,000; the trustee
    - $22,000; the assignees - $25,000.  All costs awards are inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>

    agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons delivered by the
    motion judge.  However, my colleague, Borins J.A., in his reasons, has addressed
    three matters that were not considered by the motion judge.  I take issue
    in respect of one of the three matters.  I am unable to agree with the limited
    scope that my colleague attaches to the word “vary”, found in rule 37.14(1)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> – the rule that is in issue in this
    case and which was relied upon by the Registrar in seeking to vary the order
    of Campbell J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague notes that he is “concerned only with the meaning of the word ‘vary’ in
    the context of rule 37.14(1) and s. 187(5) of the BIA, not with the circumstances
    that might prompt a motion to vary, such as an order or judgment granted
    on motion without notice.”  My problem with this statement is that for the
    most part rule 37.14(1) is concerned with orders obtained on motions without
    notice or in respect of orders against persons who failed “to appear on the
    motion through accident, mistake or insufficient notice.”  This is the rule
    that is commonly and regularly used to attack ex parte orders.  In my view,
    it is not possible to examine the word “vary” in the rule by excluding reference
    to its ex parte character.  I find it difficult, therefore, to ascribe a
    narrow definition to the word “vary” which, for the great majority of cases,
    if not all cases, has no application to the purpose of the rule at all.</p>

  <p class=ParaNo0 style='line-height:normal'>The phrase “on such terms as are
    just” is an express indication that a judge may make whatever order is appropriate
    to ensure that a just result is achieved.  In my view, the language of subparagraph
    2 does not confine the scope of the word “vary” in subparagraph 1 in the
    manner suggested by my colleague.</p>

    I cannot agree with his conclusion concerning the limited scope of the rule.</p>

    because of the allegations of improper conduct levelled at the Trustee which
    she characterized as an “unfounded attack on the integrity and reputation
    of the Trustee.”  While the appellants continued in this court to seek an
    order for leave to commence an action against the Trustee for negligence
