  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3><i>The Hudson’s Bay Company Pension Plan</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1961, the Bay established a contributory defined benefit
    pension plan for its employees (the “Plan”).  The Plan’s funds are held in trust (the “Fund”).  During the Plan’s existence, the Fund has
    been managed by three successive trustees: Royal Trust Company, National Trust
    Company, Ltd., and Investors Group Trust Co. Ltd.  Investors Group has been the trustee since
    1971.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained more fully below, at all times, the Plan has
    expressly limited members’ entitlement in the Fund to the pension benefits
    provided for by the Plan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Plan’s inception, Plan members have been given
    pension booklets describing their pension benefits.  In 1966, the Plan was amended to require the
    Bay to provide each member with “a written explanation of the terms and
    conditions of the Plan and all subsequent amendments thereto; together with an
    explanation of his [or her] rights and duties with respect to the benefits
    available to him under the Plan.”<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pension booklets were an important source of
    information for employees, especially those employees who worked in
    geographically isolated communities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan remains an ongoing plan and continues to
    provide retirement security for thousands of Bay employees.</p>
  <h3><i>Development
    of the Pension Plan Surplus</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 1961 to 1982, the Plan was in deficit.  The Bay made additional payments to ensure the
    Plan’s solvency. Given the deficit, there was no issue of surplus entitlement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan’s first actuarial surplus was generated in 1982.  In response to the emergence of the surplus,
    the Bay did two things. First, beginning in 1982, it started taking contribution
    holidays and paying Plan expenses from the Fund. Second, in 1984 it applied to
    the Superintendent of Pensions to withdraw surplus pension assets.  Following employee protest, the Bay withdrew
    the surplus withdrawal application.  </p>
  <h3><i>The
    Asset
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale and
    Transfer of Pension Assets</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the mid-1980s, the Bay was losing money and so
    decided to sell various business divisions.  In 1987, it sold the assets of its Northern
    Stores Division (“NSD”) to a retail company that became the North West Company
    (“NWC”) (the “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale”).
    As part of the sale agreement, NWC promised to offer employment to all affected
    employees.  Consequently, approximately 1,200
    NSD employees became NWC employees (the “Transferred Employees”).  The Transferred Employees who participated in
    the Plan represented approximately 10% of the Plan members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also as part of the sale, the Bay signed a pension plan
    agreement (the “Agreement”). The Agreement provided that NWC would establish a new
    pension plan (the “NWC Plan”) to provide each Transferred Employee with a pension
    and other benefits “at least equal to those presently provided under the [Plan]”
    and which would recognize service with the Bay for all purposes.  The Bay agreed to transfer to NWC cash assets
    equal to the pension liabilities of the Transferred Employees.  Under the terms of the Agreement, following
    the transfer of assets, the Bay and the Plan were to have no further obligations
    or liability for the pension benefits of the Transferred Employees.  However, as existing NSD retirees were not
    transferred to the NWC Plan, the Plan remained responsible for their
    pensions.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the negotiation of the Agreement, NWC queried whether
    some part of the actuarial surplus in the Plan ought to be transferred to the
    NWC Plan. When the Bay said that any such transfer would increase the purchase
    price, NWC dropped the issue. At the time of the sale, the Plan had an
    actuarial surplus of approximately $94 million.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on an actuarial report from William M. Mercer
    Limited (the “Mercer Report”), the Bay was to transfer approximately $12.6
    million to the NWC Plan. By letter dated January 6, 1989, the Superintendent of
    Pensions gave interim approval for the transfer of that amount. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NWC disputed the transfer amount on the basis that it
    failed to properly account for the Transferred Employees’ early retirement
    benefits.  In a decision dated April 30,
    1990, the Superintendent agreed with NWC but held that he did not have the
    jurisdiction to order a further transfer (the “Superintendent’s Decision”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NWC then brought a court application for a
    determination of rights under the Agreement.  By order dated July 12, 1991, the Bay was required to transfer an
    additional $1.3 million – the amount necessary to fund the Transferred
    Employees’ early retirement benefits – to the NWC Plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent’s Decision also briefly addressed
    the issue of whether a portion of the pension surplus had to be transferred.  In the Superintendent’s Decision, he stated,
    “[i]t goes beyond my power to determine the issue of [surplus] entitlement – an
    issue that more properly lies with the Court.”  </p>
  <h3><i>The Statement of Claim</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the Superintendent’s Decision, the Respondents
    initiated a representative proceeding in which they sought, among other things,
    a declaration that the Transferred Employees had a legal or equitable interest
    in the Fund, and an order that the Bay transfer a <i>pro rata</i> share of surplus to the NWC Plan or that part of the
    surplus in the Plan be held in trust for the Transferred Employees.  They also sought an order requiring the Bay to
    pay into the Fund two further sums:  (1) an
    amount equal to that which the Bay had taken by way of contribution holidays
    from 1982 to 1986, and (2) the amount that had been paid from the Fund for Plan
    expenses between 1982 and 1986.    </p>
  <h3><i>The
    Trial Decision</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the Respondents called six former NSD
    employees as witnesses.  The parties had agreed
    that an additional twenty-three Transferred Employees should be randomly
    selected for examination for discovery.  The
    testimony of these employees was read in at trial as well.  The trial judge concluded, on the basis of the
    employees’ testimony, that “at least in the minds of some employees”, surplus
    would be used “at least in part” to improve pensions in the future.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also viewed the fact that the Bay
    withdrew the surplus application it had made to the Pension Commission of
    Ontario as evidence of a belief of some employees that the Bay did not own the
    surplus. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 181 of the reasons, the trial judge held that
    the transfer of assets without surplus from the Plan to NWC amounted to a breach
    of trust.  The basis for that conclusion
    is largely in paras. 132, 134-136, 149 and 151, which read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[132]  As a
    matter of trust principle, what in my view occurred was a division or split of
    trust assets between HBC (which remained as trustee for the employee
    beneficiaries who were not transferred) and NWC, which assumed trustee
    responsibilities for the benefit of employees who were transferred. This
    division or split of assets did not result in a crystallization of surplus that
    would occur with a termination or wind-up, partial or full. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[134]  The result
    is an unequal division of pension assets in circumstances where those assets
    are to be utilized for providing pension benefits to two groups of employees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[135]  One
    group of employees and its trustee (HBC) will have more than a pro rata share
    of the entire assets, the other (NWC) as trustee for its employees will have
    less than a pro rata share of the entire assets transferred in respect of those
    employees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[136] What the [T]ransferred [E]mployees have been
    deprived of as a result of the transfer is a certain portion of total assets
    that would have been available for purposes not only of the defined benefit to
    which they were entitled by contract, but in addition the possibility of
    improvement to the new plan, particularly when employees became retired
    employees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[149]  In the
    case at bar, in theory at least, one group of beneficiaries (the continuing
    employees in HBC) stood to benefit from access to a greater pool of assets for
    ensuring payment of and potentially improvement to their pensions than another
    group (those transferred to the NWC), who were deprived of the assets to the
    portion of the surplus at transfer that may have been available to ensure
    payment of and potentially improve their defined benefit pensions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[151]  I
    conclude that the surplus in this case at the time of division was subject to
    the “classic” or “true” trust considerations set out in Schmidt<i> </i>and that without specific notice to the
    beneficiaries and their concurrence to do so, or alternatively an order of the
    Pension Commission, non-transference of the rateable portion of surplus
    represented a breach of trust on the part of HBC [the Bay].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons given in respect of contribution holidays
    and payment of Plan expenses were brief.  The trial judge stated at para. 157, “I conclude on the evidence before
    me that HBC was entitled as a matter of contract to deduct Plan expenses and
    contribution holiday amounts from the Plan funds.”  In para. 158 he set out some of the key
    provisions of the 1961 Plan documentation and noted that by 1985, amendments to
    the Plan enabled the Bay to make contributions based on actuarial advice,
    permitted all Plan expenses to be paid from the Fund and provided that on Plan
    discontinuance or termination, surplus was to be paid to the Bay.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of his conclusion that the Bay was entitled to
    take contribution holidays and pay Plan expenses from the Fund, but that the
    Transferred Employees had a reasonable expectation to benefit enhancements from
    the surplus, the trial judge struggled to find an appropriate remedy for the
    breach of trust.  Ultimately, he
    concluded that restitutionary principles could be used to devise such a remedy.  He concluded that a further sum of money
    should be transferred from the Fund to the NWC Plan but that the “specifics of
    this remedy will require further submissions” (para. 198).  Paragraph 5 of the Order directed the parties
    to re-attend to make submissions on, among other things, the appropriate remedy
    and amount of surplus to be transferred.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue raised on this appeal is whether the trial
    judge erred in declaring that the Transferred Employees had an equitable right to
    a rateable portion of the actuarial surplus in the Fund at the time of the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the Bay’s submission on the main appeal is
    that the trial judge erred in holding that:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>the
    Respondents have a right to a distribution of actuarial surplus from an ongoing

    Respondents have an enforceable right to surplus based solely on the subjective

    Employees; and, </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>the
    Bay committed a breach of trust by failing to transfer a portion of surplus at
    the time of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale,
    given the undisputed evidence that the Bay’s transfer of pension assets was
    completed in full compliance with the terms of the Plan documentation and the applicable
    statutory provisions, including the consent and approval of the Superintendent
    of Pensions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents submit that the trial judge made no errors.  Their position can be summarized as
    follows.  The Transferred Employees
    reasonably believed that the Fund belonged to the Plan members.  Consequently, as Plan members, the
    Transferred Employees had an interest in the surplus in the Plan at the time of
    the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale.  Equity requires that all Plan beneficiaries
    be treated fairly.  In order to be
    treated in a manner that was consistent with the treatment of those Plan
    members who remained in the Plan (the “continuing Plan members”), an
    appropriate share of the surplus assets should have been transferred to the NWC
    Plan on their behalf at the time of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale.  The trial judge recognized all of this and
    fashioned an appropriate remedy.      </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WAS THE BAY OBLIGED TO TRANSFER
    SOME SHARE OF SURPLUS?  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the issue raised on the main appeal can be
    resolved only by first determining whether the Transferred Employees had any
    entitlement to surplus at the time of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale.  If they did not, in light of the terms of the
    Agreement and the absence of legislation to the contrary, there could have been
    no obligation on the part of the Bay to transfer any portion of the Plan’s
    actuarial surplus to the NWC Plan.  If
    they did have such an entitlement, other questions follow before it can be
    decided what, if anything, must be done in respect of the actuarial surplus in
    the Plan at the time of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale,
    particularly as the Plan was ongoing.  As
    I explain below, in my view the Transferred Employees had no such
    entitlement.  Thus, there is no need to
    address those other questions on this appeal.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Schmidt v. Air
    Products Canada Ltd.</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611 is the seminal case on surplus
    entitlement.  In <i>Schmidt</i>, Cory J., writing on behalf of the majority, held that
    absent legislation governing entitlement to surplus, entitlement is to be
    decided by a careful analysis of the pension plan documentation.  At 639, he states that if the pension plan
    assets are impressed with a trust, those assets are subject to the requirements
    of trust law and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> [t]he terms
    of the pension plan [text] are relevant to distribution issues only to the
    extent that those terms are incorporated by reference in the instrument which
    creates the trust.  The contract or
    pension plan may influence the payment of trust funds but its terms cannot
    compel a result which is at odds with the existence of the trust. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the Plan’s inception, the pension plan assets have
    been held by way of a trust: see Articles 1.18<a

'>[3]</span></span></span></a> of the original Plan text. Accordingly, in 1961 when the Bay established the
    pension plan for its employees, it entered into a trust agreement with the
    Royal Trust Company (the “original Trust Agreement”).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    way of trust. Thus, in accordance with the guidance provided by <i>Schmidt</i>, I must begin a determination of
    entitlement to surplus by considering the provisions of the original Trust Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before doing so, it is useful to make some general
    comments about the nature and purpose of the Plan documentation.  In the present case – as in <i>Schmidt </i>– there are two types of
    documentation: the pension plan text and the fund management agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pension plan text is a contract between the
    employer and the employee.  It governs
    the administration of the pension plan, providing for such things as
    eligibility for membership in the plan; benefits on events such as retirement,
    termination and death; the method by which the plan will be funded; and, the
    method by which the pension plan will be administered.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A pension plan cannot consist of promises alone; assets
    must be accumulated from which the pension benefits will be paid.  Hence, the need for the second type of
    document – the fund management agreement.  The parties to the fund management agreement are the employer and the
    person charged with the obligation of holding and managing the pension funds.  In the present case, as has been noted, the
    pension plan assets are held by way of trust and, accordingly, the fund
    management agreement is a trust agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wish to make two further comments before turning to a
    consideration of the provisions of the Plan documentation.  The first comment arises as a result of para.
    173 of the reasons of the trial judge.  In that paragraph, the trial judge writes that where a pension plan is
    not terminated or wound-up, in the absence of legislative directives, “it is
    reasonable to look at the history of conduct of the parties to determine what
    their expectation in respect of surplus was at any point in time”.  If this statement means that the parties’
    rights and obligations are to be decided on the basis of conduct, rather than
    the governing legal documents, I must respectfully disagree.  <i>Schmidt </i>is clear.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  So too are the myriad of other pension cases decided
    to date in which surplus has been in issue.  The starting point for any determination of the rights and obligations
    of the parties to a pension plan is the Plan documentation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second point relates to the pension booklets
    provided by the Bay to its employees.  As
    I explain below in the part of these reasons that deals with the payment of
    Plan and Fund expenses, those booklets do not derogate from the rights of the
    parties created by the Plan documentation.  In any event, the booklets are largely irrelevant to the issue of
    surplus entitlement as the 1984 booklet is the only booklet that makes any reference
    to the existence and possible use of surplus.  The language does not amount to a </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>promise or
    representation and the trial judge does not make a finding that it does.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  Moreover, as will be seen, the booklets
    expressly referred Plan members to the official Plan text and, again as will be
    seen, by 1984 the official Plan documentation contained language giving surplus
    to the Company.  Further, in <i>Schmidt</i>, Cory J. declined to give any
    effect to the brochure which contained an express statement that surplus would
    be distributed to the employees on plan termination.  The issue of surplus entitlement was decided
    solely on the plan documentation.  His
    finding that the brochure did not amount to a promise intended to affect the
    legal relationship between the parties was, in part, based on the fact that the
    brochure stated that the pension plan was subject to amendment.  Again, as will be seen, the booklets in
    question in the present case contain similar language to that in <i>Schmidt </i>and expressly state that the Company
    retained the right to amend the Plan “in any way, at any time”.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to consider the original Trust

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the original Trust Agreement was to
    establish the Fund.  There is nothing in
    its provisions that speaks directly to the matter of entitlement to the Fund.  It is clear, however, that the original Trust
    Agreement did not bestow any rights to the Fund beyond those given to Plan
    members under the terms of the Plan text.  I reach this </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>conclusion based
    on the following provisions of the original Trust Agreement:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.  FUND HELD

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have reviewed those parts of the later trust
    agreements which are on the record, up to and including the agreement dated
    January 1, 1984, which agreement governs the period called into question on
    this appeal.  With one exception, there
    is nothing in the later trust agreements to a different effect than that in the
    original Trust Agreement.  The one
    exception is contained in the trust agreement between the Bay, Simpsons Limited
    and Investors Group Co. Ltd. dated January 1, 1984 (the “1984 Trust
    Agreement”).  I will return to a
    consideration of the 1984 Trust Agreement in a moment.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to art. 22 of the original Trust Agreement,
    set out above, the Plan text was incorporated into the original Trust
    Agreement.  The first Plan text is dated
    May 11, 1961, but establishes the effective date of the Plan as July 1, 1961
    (the “original Plan text”).  As Cory J.
    noted in the above-quoted passage from <i>Schmidt</i>,<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    agreement, the provisions of the Plan text become relevant to the question of
    surplus entitlement.  Reading the Plan
    text and Trust Agreement as an “integrated whole” is consonant also with the
    direction of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Buschau
    v. Rogers Communications Inc.</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 973 at para. 2, where
    Deschamps J., writing for the majority, noted that a pension trust agreement is

    set out below.  A review of those
    provisions leads to the conclusion that the entitlement of Plan members was
    limited to the defined benefits provided by its terms.  Thus, they had no entitlement to
    surplus.  Article 11.03 stipulates that no
    Plan member (or former member) had any right or interest in the Fund, except as
    “expressly provided in the Plan”.  Article 12.01 stipulates that no amendment could be made to the Plan
    text which permitted any part of the Fund to be used for “purposes other than
    those contemplated by the Plan”.  While there
    is nothing express in the original Plan text about its purpose, a review of its
    provisions makes it clear that its purpose was to set out the entitlement of
    Plan members to benefits on the happening of certain events.  Article 12.02 provided that in the event of
    Plan termination, the assets held in the Fund were to be apportioned among the
    active members, retired members and terminated members in accordance with a
    formula.  However, article 12.024 specifically
    limited the entitlements of Plan members on termination to the commuted value
    of their defined benefits.  Article 14.01
    provides that Plan members have no rights to any benefits except those
    specifically provided for by the terms of the Plan.  As has been noted, the only benefits
    specifically provided for were pension benefits.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provisions of the original Plan text read

    amendment shall be made which shall authorize or permit any part of the fund to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.02: <i>Vesting

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.022: <i>Allocation
    of the Trust Fund</i>: The Retirement Board shall then allocate to each Member,
    Retired Member (including Joint Annuitants and Beneficiaries, if any) a

    of such benefit, if so determined by the Retirement Board with respect to any
    or all such Members, Retired Members and Terminated Members, a lump sum payment
    equal to) the total of his own contributions plus Credited Interest to the date
    the Plan is terminated, less any retirement benefits, or returns of his own
    contributions and Credited Interest in accordance with the Plan, theretofore
    received by him.  If the Trust fund is
    insufficient for this purpose, it shall be allocated to each Member, Retired
    Member (including Joint Annuitants and Beneficiaries, if any) and Terminated
    Members (including Beneficiaries, if any) in the proportion that the amount of
    his contributions plus Credited Interest to the date the Plan is terminated,

    Interest in accordance with the Plan, theretofore received by him bears to the
    total of such amounts with respect to all such Members, Retired Members and

    remain, it shall then be applied in the following manner: First, for the
    benefit of Retired Members and such of the Terminated Members who have reached
    their Normal Retirement Date and are entitled to retirement benefits under
    Article 6 of the Plan, in each case upon the basis of their Retirement benefits;
    and Second, as to any balance remaining, for the benefit of all Members and
    such of the Terminated Members who are entitled to retirement benefits under
    Article 6 of the Plan but who have not yet reached their Normal Retirement
    Date, in each case upon the basis of their accrued retirement benefits at the
    date of such termination of contributions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.024: <i>Apportionment
    of Balance of the Trust Fund to be Proportional</i>: <i>Any apportionment with each group, in the order stated, shall be

    at the date of the termination of the Plan of their respective retirement
    benefits and accrued retirement benefits.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.03: <i>Continuation
    of Trust Fund for Payment of Benefits</i>: Distribution of benefits in
    accordance with the foregoing allocations shall be made by continuing the Trust
    Fund in existence for the payment of retirement benefits, or at the discretion
    of the Retirement Board (or in the event that there is no Retirement Board at
    the discretion of the Trustee), by the purchase of annuity contracts or by cash
    payment.                                                                        …</p>

    that they had no interest in any surplus in the Fund.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan was restated in 1985.  The 1985 Plan text made no change in the

    of the

    Sale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I mentioned above, until the 1984 Trust Agreement,
    the trust agreements did not deal with the issue of entitlement to surplus.
    Article 2(d) of the 1984 Trust Agreement authorised the trustee to pay certain
    fees and expenses and concluded that “no part of the funds may be used for, or
    diverted to any purposes other than those connected with the </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>exclusive
    benefit of members”.  This limiting
    language is contained also in article </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>11(ii).<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, article 12 of the 1984 Trust Agreement directs
    the trustee, on Plan discontinuance, to dispose of the Fund in accordance with
    the provisions of the Plan text.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[18]</span></span></span></a>   At the time the 1984 Trust Agreement
    took effect, the relevant Plan provisions were those in the 1980 Plan
    text.  The 1980 Plan text, as I have explained,
    continued to limit the rights of Plan members to the promised defined benefits
    and made express the Company’s right to surplus.  As the 1980 Plan text provisions were
    incorporated into the 1984 Trust Agreement, in order for the provisions of both
    the Plan text and the trust agreement to have effect, I interpret articles 2(d)
    and 11(ii) of the 1984 Trust Agreement as precluding payments from being made
    from the Fund and amendments being made to the Trust Agreement unless such
    payments and amendments were in furtherance of the payment of pension benefits
    to the Plan members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not read articles 2(d) and 11(ii) of the 1984
    Trust Agreement as giving Plan members entitlement to surplus for three reasons.  First, the specific language of article 12.025
    in the 1980 Plan text “trumps” the general language in articles 2(d) and 11(ii)
    of the 1984 Trust Agreement.  Further, art.
    12.025 of the 1980 Plan text was operative for some years before the 1984 Trust
    Agreement (which contained articles 2(d) and 11(ii) for the first time) came
    into effect.  There is no suggestion in
    the 1984 Trust Agreement that its provisions were intended to alter or amend the
    1980 Plan text or article 12.025 thereof.  To the contrary.  Article 1 of the
    1984 Trust Agreement reiterates that the 1980 Plan text (and any amendments
    thereto) forms part of the 1984 Trust Agreement “as if all of [its] provisions
    were fully set forth herein”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Plan texts and trust agreements from inception,
    and in every subsequent incarnation, made the Plan the dominant document.  See, for example, articles 22 and 23 of the
    original Trust Agreement and article 11.03 of the original Plan text.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, both the Plan texts and the trust agreements always
    contemplated that the documents would be read together.  To interpret articles 2(d) and 11(ii) as
    proposed above gives meaning to all provisions in both documents.  Moreover, it complies with the terms of the
    documents which stipulate that they are to be read together and the limiting
    language in the 1984 Trust Agreement that it confers no right to any benefit
    beyond that provided for in the Plan text.<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[19]</span></span></span></a>  To interpret articles 2(d) and 11(ii) as
    giving Plan members entitlement to surplus would cause those provisions to
    directly conflict with article 12.025 of the Plan text.  That is at odds with basic principles
    governing the interpretation of contracts and the specific terms of the
    documents themselves. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Plan members, including the Transferred Employees,
    had no entitlement to surplus, it could not have been a breach of trust to fail
    to transfer a rateable portion of surplus to the NWC Plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is appropriate at this juncture to respond to the
    Bay’s argument that it was not a trustee and therefore could not have been held
    to have been in breach of trust.  I
    accept that the Bay was not the trustee – it did not hold legal title to the
    Fund.  I also accept that the trial judge
    referred to the Bay as a trustee.  However, it seems to me that the use of the word “trustee” was a simple
    misstatement on the part of the trial judge.  The Bay, as the Plan administrator, was a fiduciary.  Had there been a legal obligation to transfer
    part of the surplus at the time of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale
    and had it been found that the Bay failed to cause that to occur, the proper
    nomenclature would have been a finding that the Bay was in breach of its
    fiduciary obligations to the Transferred Employees.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the issue of surplus entitlement, the
    trial judge did not consider the terms of the Plan documentation.  Instead, he concluded that the Transferred
    Employees had a right to surplus because some employees thought surplus would
    be used “at least in part” to improve pensions.<a
href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[20]</span></span></span></a>  I do not accept this as a legitimate basis
    for creating legal rights and obligations at odds with the provisions of the
    Plan documentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only a limited number of the Transferred Employees
    testified.  Of those, while some
    testified that they believed that surplus would be used to improve benefits,
    others had not thought about surplus entitlement and yet others understood their
    only entitlement was to the promised pension benefits.  Further, as the trial judge himself found, those
    witnesses who testified that they thought surplus would be used for benefit
    improvements had only a vague notion in that regard – they thought surplus
    would be used “at least in part” for such a purpose.  In the circumstances, I do not accept that it
    was open to the trial judge to conclude that there was a class-wide expectation
    that surplus would be used to provide ongoing improvements to the members into
    the indefinite future, particularly when such a view was contrary to the terms
    of the Plan documentation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the foregoing is sufficient to dispose of the
    appeal, I wish to comment on the trial judge’s concern that surplus assets
    remaining in the Fund after the Sale would be available for the benefit of the
    continuing Plan members but not for the benefit of the Transferred Employees.  As he notes at para. 149 of his reasons, by
    failing to transfer surplus attributable to the Transferred Employees, there
    was a greater pool of assets from which to ensure payment of the pension
    benefits for continuing Plan members and which might have been used to fund
    improvements to those pensions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a valid concern.  It is rooted in basic notions of fairness.  Moreover, a fundamental trust principle is
    that beneficiaries of a trust are to be treated in an even-handed fashion – one
    group of beneficiaries is not to be preferred over another unless the trust
    instrument so decrees.  However, it is
    critical to note the caveat: unless the trust instrument so decrees.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trust agreements, which incorporated
    the Plan texts, did not give any right or interest in the surplus to the
    Transferred Employees.  While the Plan is
    ongoing, as I explain below, the Bay has the right to use the actuarial surplus
    by way of contribution holiday and it is entitled to cause all Plan and Fund
    expenses to be paid from the Fund.  On termination,
    the Bay is entitled to the surplus.  That
    is, the trust instrument displaces the even-handed requirement in respect of
    Plan members by means of the rights it gives to the Bay.  The obligation at the time of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale was to ensure that
    all Plan members received their promised pension benefits.  That occurred - sufficient assets were
    transferred to the NWC Plan to ensure that the Transferred Employees would
    receive all the pension benefits which they had been promised under the
    Plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some other observations can usefully be made in respect
    of the identified concern.  First, there
    was no obligation on the Bay to use the actuarial surplus in the Plan in any particular
    way, much less to improve pension benefits.  The Bay had the right to continue to use the actuarial surplus for
    contribution holidays and, as explained below, to pay Plan and Fund expenses.  Second, even if some part of the surplus had
    been transferred to NWC, no one has suggested that NWC would have been bound to
    use the surplus for benefit improvement for the Transferred Employees.  NWC may have had the right to use such monies
    to take contribution holidays or to pay for Plan and Fund expenses or both.  Third, the NWC Plan is a healthy, ongoing
    pension plan.  On the record, it appears
    to be fully funded with its own actuarial surplus.  The Transferred Employees have received
    ongoing benefit improvements which have been funded from the actuarial surplus
    in the NWC Plan.  Fourth, it is worth
    recalling that the trial judge found that the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale did not constitute a partial wind-up.  No employee lost his or her employment or
    pension service or benefits as a result of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale and there was no crystallization of
    surplus.   <u></u></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan came into existence in 1961.  Prior to 1982, the Bay paid all expenses
    relating to both the administration of the Plan and management of the Fund.  In 1982 when the Plan was in surplus, the Bay
    began paying the Plan expenses from the Fund.  As the Transferred Employees left the Plan in early 1987, the only
    period in which the payment of Plan expenses is called into question in this
    appeal is from 1982 through to and including 1986. </p>

    mind that each document governs different activities and different types of
    expenses.   It will be recalled that the
    Plan text governs the administration of the pension plan.  Apart from the obvious expenses associated
    with keeping employee data up-to-date, there are significant expenses
    associated with pension plan administration that arise from the need for
    regulatory compliance.  These expenses
    include such things as actuarial valuations.  If a plan fails to comply with the regulatory requirements, its
    registration may be revoked.<a href="#_ftn23"

    matter of expenses has been addressed and:  </p>

    text.  As the period in question is from
    1982 to 1986 (the “Period”), I must consider all of the Plan texts from
    inception up to and including those that operated during the Period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 1961 Plan text is silent on the issue of the
    payment of expenses.  A review of the
    Plan text amendments and restated Plan texts on the record up to 1985 yields
    the same result: silence on the matter of payment of Plan administration
    expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1985, the Plan was amended and restated.  Article 11.06 of the 1985 Plan text provided
    that all Plan administration expenses were a charge on the income of the Fund
    and, unless the Bay chose to pay such expenses, they were to be paid by the
    Trustee from the Fund.<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[26]</span></span></span></a>  Thus, from 1961 to 1985 when the Plan was
    silent on the issue of payment of Plan expenses, the Bay was not obliged to pay
    such expenses as it had not undertaken to do so.  Thereafter, while the Bay could pay such
    expenses had it wished, article 11.06 explicitly authorised payment of such
    expenses from the Fund.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn next to consider the relevant trust
    agreements.  As previously discussed, from
    the Plan’s inception, the pension assets have been held in a trust.  Article 21 of the original Trust Agreement addresses
    the matter of expenses.  It reads as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>21.  The
    Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation as may from time to time be
    mutually agreed in writing with the Company. <i>Such compensation and</i> <i>all
    other disbursements made and expenses incurred</i> <i>in the management of the Fund shall be paid by the Company</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents argue that the wording of art. 21 of
    the original Trust Agreement is broader than that considered in <i>Kerry</i>.  They contend that art. 21 placed an obligation on the Bay to pay all
    Plan expenses – not only those associated with fund management.  In making this argument, the Respondents rely
    on the emphasized portion of art. 21, particularly the reference to <i>all</i> disbursements and expenses
    incurred.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree.  On a plain reading of art. 21, the Bay is obliged to pay for trustee
    compensation and expenses incurred in the management of the Fund.  Article 21 makes no mention of plan
    administration expenses.  This comes as
    no surprise given that the purpose of the original Trust Agreement was to deal
    with Fund management, whereas the purpose of the Plan text was to deal with
    Plan administration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the wording of art. 21 of the original Trust
    Agreement is very similar to that of art. 5 in <i>Kerry</i>.  Article 21 placed the
    obligation on the Bay to pay for trustee compensation and “all other
    disbursements made and expenses incurred in the management of the Fund”.  In <i>Kerry</i>,
    art. 5 placed the obligation on the employer to pay for trustee compensation
    and “all other proper charges and disbursements of the Trustee”.  It appears to me that both articles perform
    the same function – they oblige the employer to pay the expenses associated
    with fund management, including trustee compensation.  Neither addresses the expenses associated
    with plan administration.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, for so long as art. 21 of the original Trust Agreement
    was operative, the Bay was obliged to pay the Fund management expenses.  As the Bay did not undertake to pay the Plan
    administration expenses, it was entitled to have those expenses paid from the
    Fund from the outset. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1971, the original Trust Agreement was terminated
    and the Bay entered into a new trust agreement with the Investors Group Trust
    Co. Ltd. (the “1971 Trust Agreement”).  Article 7 of the 1971 Trust Agreement expressly authorised the payment
    of Plan administration expenses and Fund expenses, apart from the trustee’s
    remuneration, from the Fund.  Article 7
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.  <i>Administration costs and expenses of or in
    connection with the Fund or the Plan</i> and all taxes of any and all kinds
    whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws upon or
    in respect of the Fund or the income thereof <i>shall be paid from the fund unless the Company otherwise directs</i>.  <i>The
    Trustee’s remuneration in respect of its services hereunder shall be paid by
    the Company</i> and shall not be a charge against the Fund.  Such remuneration shall be arrived at by an
    agreement between the Company and the Trustee independent of this Agreement.
    [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of art. 7 of the 1971 Trust Agreement,
    by the time the Bay began paying the Plan expenses from the Fund in 1982, it
    had express authority to do so, apart from the limited obligation to pay
    trustee remuneration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1984, even the Bay’s limited obligation to pay
    trustee remuneration was removed.  At
    that time, the Bay and Simpsons entered into a new trust agreement with
    Investors Group (the “1984 Trust Agreement”).  The 1984 Trust Agreement replaced the 1971 Trust Agreement.  Article 2(d) of the 1984 Trust Agreement
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2(d).  The
    Trustee is hereby authorized to pay out of each of the appropriate funds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                            …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>all other expenses and costs of administering the Funds
    including reasonable compensation for its services as may from time to time be
    agreed upon to the extent that such expenses have not been met or provided for
    by The Bay, or Simpsons, as the case may be.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ALWAYS PROVIDED that no part of the funds may be
    used for, or diverted to any purposes other than those connected with the exclusive
    benefit of members of the respective Plans and their beneficiaries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no reason to doubt the validity of the 1971 and
    1984 amendments.  To the extent that the
    amendments permitted the Bay to pay Plan administration expenses from the Fund,
    no question as to the validity of the amendments can arise.  The Bay had that right from the Plan’s
    inception and the amendments simply made that right clear.  Therefore, the only question is whether art.
    21 of the original Trust Agreement could be amended.  In my view, it could.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The original Plan text and the original Trust Agreement
    contained broad powers of amendment; the 1971 and 1984 amendments are
    consistent with those original amending powers.  Article 12.01 of the 1961 Plan text gave the Bay a broad power to amend
    the Plan, in whole or in part, provided that no amendment should be made “which
    shall authorize or permit any part of the [F]und to be used for, or diverted
    to, purposes other than those contemplated by the Plan”.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Bay maintained a broad power to amend
    the original Trust Agreement.  Article 23
    of that agreement empowered the Bay to amend it “provided that no such
    amendment shall authorize or permit any part of the Fund to be used for or
    diverted to purposes other than those specified in the Plan.”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems self-evident that expenses incurred to ensure
    the due administration of the Plan and management of the Fund are purposes
    “contemplated” and “specified” by the plan documentation.  Article 10 of the 1961 Plan text provided for
    the administration of the Plan.<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    was held for the purposes set forth in those agreements and the Plan text.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[30]</span></span></span></a>  The primary purpose of the Plan documentation
    was to set out the pension promises made to Plan members and the rights and
    obligations of the Bay and the Plan members.  To ensure that the pension promises were honoured, the Plan needed to be
    continued.  To be continued, the Plan had
    to be </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>properly
    administered and the Fund properly managed.  The expenses were incurred to ensure that both of those things were achieved.  Therefore, amendments which led to expenses being
    paid from the Fund were for purposes “contemplated” or “specified” by the
    Plan.  Indeed, at trial, one of the
    Respondents’ central witnesses conceded that administrative expenses for
    actuarial fees, legal fees, trustee fees and investment management fees are all
    necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Plan.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents argue that the Plan amendments in 1971
    and 1984 are invalid because they amount to a partial revocation of trust.  This, they say, is contrary to <i>Schmidt v. Air Products Canada Ltd.</i>, [1994]
    2 S.C.R. 611.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amendments cannot amount to a partial revocation of
    trust.  A revocation of trust involves the
    return of trust funds to the person who placed the funds in the trust.  Payments to third parties do not fall within
    that definition.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    parties so cannot amount to a partial revocation of trust. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, even if the payments could constitute a
    partial revocation of trust, there is no absolute prohibition against
    revocation.  Revocation, in whole or in
    part, is acceptable if authorised by the terms of the trust agreement.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    “revoking” money that it had contributed to the Fund, it was expressly authorized
    to do so by the terms of the Plan documentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarise, the Bay was at liberty from the Plan’s
    inception to pay Plan administration expenses from the Fund.  Despite that, it paid such expenses until
    1982.  In relation to trustee
    compensation and Fund management expenses, pursuant to art. 21 of the 1961
    Trust Agreement, the Bay was obliged to pay those expenses until 1971.  In 1971, art. 21 was validly amended with the
    result that, thereafter, the Bay was entitled to pay all Fund management
    expenses, apart from trustee fees, from the Fund.  Nonetheless, the Bay paid all trustee fees
    and Fund management expenses until 1982.  Between 1982 and 1984, pursuant to the 1971 amendment, the Bay was
    obliged to pay the trustee fees, which it did.  However, Fund management expenses were paid from the Fund.  After 1984, as a result of a further amendment
    of the trust agreement, all Plan and Fund expenses – including trustee fees – could
    be paid from the Fund and they were.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of the
    cross-appeal.  </p>
  <h3><i>What is the effect of the
    Employee Booklets on the Bay’s ability to pay Plan expenses from the Fund? </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents also argue that the Bay made
    representations to its employees about the payment of Plan expenses.  They say that from 1961 to 1984 the Bay,
    through the pension booklets it provided to employees (the “Booklets”), stated that
    it was paying for all Plan expenses (the “Statement”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first Booklet was published in 1961, to coincide
    with the creation of the Plan.  The
    Booklet was updated on a regular basis.  In the Period, there are two relevant Booklets: the one published in
    1980 and the subsequent revised version that was published in 1984. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first page of a Booklet was a title page that
    simply identified the document as pertaining to the Bay’s pension plan.  At the bottom of the first page of text, the
    following paragraph appeared (the “First Disclaimer”),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any such plan is bound to be complicated.  This booklet is only a summary for your
    convenience; for detailed information on any point, you should refer to the
    official text of the plan, which is readily available to you on request.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Statement was located in a section in the Booklet
    entitled “notes”.  It reads as follows:<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[35]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The entire cost of administering the plan will be
    borne by the Company.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following statement, also located in the “notes”
    section of the Booklet,   immediately
    preceded the Statement (the “Second Disclaimer”):<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Company expects to continue this pension plan
    indefinitely.  But circumstances can
    change, and the Company has to reserve the right to modify the plan in any way,
    at any time.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, in my view, the Booklets do
    not derogate from the Bay’s right, explained above, to amend the Plan so as to permit
    the payment of all Plan expenses from the Fund.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Schmidt</i>, Cory
    J. opined that in certain circumstances, an employer’s pension brochure may
    form part of the “legal matrix” within which the rights of employers and
    employees must be determined.<a href="#_ftn37"

    wording of the documents, the circumstances in which they were produced and the
    effect that they had on the parties, particularly the employees.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The wording of the First and Second Disclaimers is
    significant.  The First Disclaimer makes
    it clear that the Booklet is not to be taken as authoritative; it directed
    readers to the official Plan documentation.  By its very terms, the Booklet was intended merely as a descriptive
    outline of the Plan benefits to Plan members.  This view is reinforced by the preamble in the Booklet that “this
    booklet is only a summary for your convenience”.  And, pursuant to the First Disclaimer, had a
    Plan member referred to the official Plan documentation, because it had been
    amended, it would have revealed that Plan and Fund expenses were being paid
    from the Fund.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Disclaimer makes it clear that the Bay
    reserved to itself the right to change the terms of the Plan at any time.  That statement, in my view, would make it </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>clear to a
    reader that the statements in the brochure were not to be relied on because they
    might have been changed.  Given the
    Second Disclaimer, I do not see a Plan member as reasonably viewing the
    pre-1984 Booklets as a promise or representation by the Bay to not change the
    manner in which Plan expenses were paid.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the combined effect of the First and Second
    Disclaimers is to preclude a finding that the Statement was a “representation”
    in the sense that word was used in <i>Schmidt</i>,
    as a promise on which employees were expected to rely.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, from 1961 to 1982, the Statement that “[t]he
    entire cost of administering the plan will be paid by the Company” was correct.  During that period, the Bay did pay for all
    of the Plan and Fund expenses.  In 1984, the
    first time a revised pension booklet was published after Plan expenses began to
    be paid from the Fund, the Bay disclosed and described how Plan expenses were being
    paid.  Instead of the Statement, the
    following information was included in the 1984 Booklet:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Administration costs in connection with the Pension
    Plan and administration costs of the fund are now charged against the fund.  These costs amount to over $700,000 a year
    and include the trustees’ fees, counsellors’ fees for managing the investments,
    record-keeping, actuarial fees, audit fees, etc.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, until 1982 and after 1984, the statements in
    the Booklet are correct and of no further concern in relation to the issue at
    hand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most that can be said is that from 1982 until
    sometime in 1984 when the 1984 Booklet was published and distributed, based on
    an earlier Booklet, a Plan member may have understood that the Bay was
    continuing to pay all Plan expenses in that period.  I say “may” because of the Disclaimers, as
    explained above.  That is insufficient to
    support a finding that a promise had been made that was intended to affect the
    legal relationship between the parties and cannot form the basis of an
    estoppel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of the cross-appeal

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ADDITIONAL ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties each raised a number of additional issues.  In relation to the surplus issue, the Bay
    asked the court to find that the trial judge erred in “bifurcating” the trial
    by requiring the parties to re-attend to determine the appropriate remedy and
    quantum of surplus to be transferred to the NWC Plan.  The Respondents asked the court to determine
    whether the Bay had violated other duties owed as the administrator of the
    Plan.  In light of the foregoing
    conclusions, it is unnecessary to decide these issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to the payment of Plan expenses, the Bay
    argued that if it were successful on the main appeal, the Respondents had no
    claim to surplus and therefore did not have the right to question utilization
    of the surplus in prior years.  While it
    is unnecessary to decide the matter, that proposition causes me unease.  Whether or not beneficiaries of a pension
    trust are entitled to surplus, I would have thought they have a right to compel
    due administration of the trust.  I need
    not decide this matter and, as it was little argued, it would be unwise to say
    more than that.  I make the comment only

    Cory at 655: “[T]he courts must determine competing claims to pension surplus
    by a careful analysis of the pension plan and the funding structures created
    under it.”  See also <i>Schmidt </i>at 703-04 per McLachlin J., dissenting in part but not on
    this point: “The task of the court is to examine the language of the documents
    to ascertain what, on a fair reading, the parties intended.  … The search for an answer to the problem
    before us must therefore focus primarily on the documents relating to the plans
    and the intention of the parties, if any, with respect to a surplus arising
    under a defined benefits plan.”</p>

    26 of the booklet read as follows:  “If
    the fund earns a high rate of interest and a high amount of interest is
    credited on my contributions, does that mean my pension will be greater?  <i>No</i>.  Your pension will be 40% of your actual
    contributions – not contributions plus interest.  The rate of credited interest is important in
    the event of death or termination however because your contributions plus
    interest are refunded.  In a general
    sense however if the fund continues to earn a high rate of interest a surplus
    will develop which <i>may </i>be used to
    improve benefits.”</p>
