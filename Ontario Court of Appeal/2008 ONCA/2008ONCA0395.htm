  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Estelle Glanc seeks to set aside the Order of Justice
    Thorburn dated November 20, 2006, refusing her request to have certain legal
    accounts rendered by the law firms O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue and Hughes Amys
    LLP referred for assessment.  The motion
    judge rejected the request on essentially two bases: (i) that Estelle did not
    have standing to have the accounts assessed, and (ii) that there was no basis
    for invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court to direct an assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time this appeal was heard, the issues between Estelle
    and O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue had been resolved through mediation, leaving only
    the matter of the referral of the Hughes Amys’ accounts to be determined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal.  In my view the court below should have exercised
    its inherent discretion in the circumstances of this case and ordered that
    those accounts be referred for assessment.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Estelle and her sisters, Krysia Piorczynski and Diane
    McKay, were involved in an estate dispute with their uncle following the death
    of their father, Ted Piorczynski.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted Piorczynski and his brother, Ben, had created a
    successful real estate portfolio valued at approximately $43 million.  The portfolio was held for the most part in a
    partnership known as the Everlast Group.  The Everlast Group was owned 50% by Ted’s company, Everlast Construction
    Company Limited (“Everlast”), and 50% by another company, Ben-Ted Construction
    Limited, which in turn was owned by both Ted and Ben.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Estelle and Krysia were each entitled to a 40% interest
    in their father’s estate and Diane was entitled to 20%.  All three sisters also owned corporations
    that held shares indirectly in Everlast.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following Ted’s death in 1998 a dispute arose between
    Ben – who was initially the estate trustee – and his nieces with respect to
    Ted’s estate and Everlast.  Estelle and
    Krysia retained Melville O’Donohue, an experienced estate litigator, to
    represent them in this dispute.  Diane
    had her own counsel.  Mr. O’Donohue was
    assisted by his son, Stephen O’Donohue, who was also a member of the firm.  When the senior O’Donohue became ill, Jack Fitch
    of the Hughes Amys firm was retained by Estelle and Krysia – at the suggestion
    of Stephen O’Donohue – to handle the estate litigation aspects of the dispute
    and to assist the O’Donohue firm in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the suggestion of Estelle, Mr. Fitch agreed to
    render his legal accounts for services rendered to the sisters to
    Everlast.  This suggestion was made
    because, as Estelle pointed out, even though she and Krysia had retained Mr.
    Fitch, everyone agreed that the Hughes Amys role was to advance the common
    interests of all three sisters, and all three sisters had an equal indirect
    interest in Everlast.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The estate issues were ultimately resolved, to the very
    considerable financial advantage of the sisters.  The settlement resulted in a corporate
    restructuring and the transfer of real estate into a fund that would generate
    substantial payments to Estelle, Krysia, and Diane.  Indeed, the evidence indicates that while
    their uncle Ben initially proposed that the interests of the three sisters in
    their father’s estate be purchased for $10 million, the result of the
    settlement was that Estelle and Krysia together realized a gross amount of more
    than three times that amount ($30.9 million).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of the settlement Everlast came under the
    control of Ted’s estate.  There were to
    be three closings, each generating payments to the sisters.  Both the O’Donohue and Huges Amys firms
    presented significant accounts for payment at the time of the first closing in
    June 2004, and – by direction from the sisters – these accounts were paid by
    Everlast.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The O’Donohue account covered a period of three years
    and was for $2,694,109.30.  The appellant
    asserts that it included an undisclosed premium of $1.2 million in addition to
    compensation on an hourly basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hughes Amys account – which, as instructed by
    Estelle and Krysia, was directed to and paid by Everlast – was in the amount of
    $696,695.46.  The appellant alleges that
    this account, too, contained a very substantial undisclosed premium.  She estimates this premium at $300,000,
    although it is not clear where that figure comes from as the amount of the
    premium, if any, has not been disclosed by Hughes Amys.  Mr. Fitch does not say in his affidavit that
    there was no premium.  In correspondence,
    however, his counsel took the position that the notion of a premium implied “that
    Hughes Amys agreed to act on the basis that it would be compensated for its
    work on an hourly basis”, whereas counsel was “informed that no such agreement
    was in place with respect to [the $696,000 account]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Estelle says that she and Krysia were concerned about
    the size of the accounts but had little time to review them and felt pressured
    to sign the direction authorizing Everlast to pay them out of the first closing
    proceeds.  Estelle and Krysia each received
    $523,000 from the first closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At no time was it disclosed to Estelle or Krysia that
    either of the accounts contained a premium.  At no time were they advised that they were entitled to have the
    accounts assessed or that authorizing Everlast to pay the accounts might in
    some way affect their right to do so.  There
    was no written retainer between Estelle and Krysia and either of the law
    firms.  There was no contingency
    agreement.  There were no discussions in
    advance concerning a premium, and no oral agreement to that effect is alleged
    by either law firm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only later, in the Fall of 2004, following enquiries of
    Stephen O’Donohue by Estelle’s personal solicitor, did the appellant learn
    about the $1.2 million premium contained in the O’Donohue account.  Stephen O’Donohue’s explanation was that the
    premium was justified by the exceptional result achieved and the degree of risk
    undertaken, among other things.  There is
    no question the results were quite favourable to the sisters and that the law
    firms carried the accounts for a period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2004, Estelle obtained an order on
    requisition under the <i>Solicitors Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. S.15 to assess the O’Donohue accounts rendered to her and Krysia.  She requested Tom Welsh, the new C.E.O of
    Everlast, to assess the Hughes Amys accounts but he declined.  In December 2004, January 2005, July 2005,
    and August 2005, she asked Hughes Amys to agree to add their accounts to the
    O’Donohue assessment.  Hughes Amys
    refused to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the O’Donohue firm submitted a further
    series of accounts to Everlast covering services rendered to Everlast from July
    2004 through to the end of 2005.  These
    accounts totalled around $250,000.  Hughes
    Amys rendered a further account to Everlast on April 18, 2005 totalling
    $47.052.34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The O’Donohue assessment was scheduled for trial in
    April 2006.  In December 2005, Estelle
    brought a motion in the O’Donohue proceeding to add the Hughes Amys accounts
    and some subsequent accounts rendered by the O’Donohue firm to Everlast to
    those proceedings.  As mentioned at the
    outset of these reasons, the motion judge rejected Estelle’s request to have
    the accounts referred for assessment.  While the appeal respecting the O’Donohue accounts has been settled, the
    question whether the Hughes Amys account should be referred remains.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two reasons why the appeal must be allowed,
    in my view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I do not accept the argument that Estelle was
    not “the client” but that Everlast was.  Estelle and Krysia were in reality the clients for whom the O’Donohue
    and Hughes Amys firms provided services.  Estelle therefore has standing to have the accounts assessed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the <i>Rules
    of Professional Conduct</i> of the Law Society of Upper Canada require that Estelle
    and Krysia, as clients, be told (a) whether the accounts contained a premium,
    and (b) that they had the right to have the accounts assessed under the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  They were told neither.  Underlying these requirements is the
    important principle that courts have an inherent jurisdiction over the conduct
    of solicitors and over their own process in order to maintain public confidence
    in the administration of justice and to ensure that a client’s request for an
    assessment is dealt with fairly and equitably: see <i>Price v. Sonsini</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 257, at para. 19.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Estelle and Krysia Were the Clients </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be little doubt that, especially prior to the
    first settlement closing in June 2004, both the O’Donohue and the Hughes Amys
    firms were acting for and representing the interests of Estelle and
    Krysia.  Estelle and Krysia were the
    clients of the firms.  Evidence of this
    is found in how the parties themselves described their relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stephen O’Donohue swears in his affidavit that “[i]n
    June 2001, our firm was retained by Estelle Glanc … and her sister Krysia
    Piorczynski”. The retainer was joint and was in relation to matters arising out
    of their interests as beneficiaries of their late father’s estate and a dispute
    about the estate with their uncle Ben.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jack Fitch deposed that when he first became involved
    in the matter in October 2002, he met with Stephen O’Donohue and was briefed on
    “O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue’s involvement in the matter on behalf of Estelle
    Glanc and Krysia Piorczynski” and was asked if he “would act as counsel <i>on their behalf</i> with respect to the
    matter.”  [Emphasis added.]   He
    “agreed to do so” and to “assist O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue in their efforts”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2003, when the estate dispute was settled,
    Estelle suggested – supported by Krysia – that Everlast be responsible for paying
    the law firms’ accounts.  She suggested
    this because even though the law firms had not been representing Diane, Diane
    had enefited from the work done, and they all had a one-third interest in
    Everlast.  Diane agreed.  Mr. Fitch states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Diane McKay’s agreement in this regard was in
    recognition of the role that Hughes Amys LLP had played in advancing the common
    interest of Estelle Glanc, Krysia Piorczynski and Diane McKay in the matter and
    resulted in a sharing of Hughes Amys LLP’s charges <i>which would otherwise, presumably, have been born by Estelle Glanc and
    Krysia Piorczynski only</i>. [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his letter of June 17, 2004, to Estelle and Krysia,
    enclosing a copy of the Hughes Amys account rendered to Everlast, Stephen
    O’Donohue concluded by advising them that the O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue
    “account for professional services rendered and disbursements <i>incurred on your behalf</i>” [emphasis
    added] would be rendered shortly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude, therefore, that the clients of the law firms
    were Estelle and Krysia.  A mechanism of
    convenience was developed – with agreement on all sides – to accommodate the
    sisters by spreading the payment equally amongst the three of them: Everlast
    would pay the accounts.  It did not
    matter to the law firms whether Estelle and Krysia or the corporation were
    responsible on the surface because the accounts were to be paid out of the
    settlement funds regardless.  Had there
    been a shortfall and had Everlast been unwilling to pay, I have no doubt
    payment would have been sought from Estelle and Krysia.</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I do not see the pertinence of s. 9(1) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, which permits “a person,
    not being chargeable as the principal party” but who “is liable to pay or has
    paid” a bill, to apply to have that bill assessed.  There was some debate here, and before the motion
    judge, about whether Estelle qualified as a “person liable to pay” for the purposes
    of that provision.  In my view, it
    matters not.  Subsection 9(1) would apply
    if <i>Everlast</i> was seeking the assessment
    (as a person “not being chargeable as a principal party” but who has paid the
    bill).  Everlast is not challenging the
    accounts, however.  Estelle has standing
    to do so, in my view – and she is supported by Krysia in this regard – simply
    because she <i>was</i> the client and may attempt
    to exercise her rights under ss. 3 and 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> as such.</p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also erred, in my opinion, when she
    determined that even if Estelle were “liable to pay” the bill she had no
    standing to do so because she was only one of the persons liable to pay.  At para. 35 of her reasons she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The courts have held that a person who is
    responsible to pay a portion of the account is not a person with standing to
    request the referral of an account for assessment as that person is not liable
    to pay the bill in whole, within the meaning of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>. (See <i>McGugan
    v. McGugan</i>, [1892] O.J. No. 16 (C.A.) at para 6 and <i>Kayor Energy Systems Inc. v. Davies, Ward &amp; Beck</i>, [2001] O.J.

    responsible to pay <i>a portion of the
    account</i>”.  [Emphasis added.]  The evidence is that she and Krysia jointly
    retained the law firms.  In the absence
    of some indication to the contrary – there is none here – Estelle and Krysia
    would each be liable for the whole amount of the bill.  Moreover, I am not persuaded that either <i>McGugan v. McGugan </i>(1892), O.A.R. 56
    (C.A.), aff’d (1892), 21 S.C.R. 267 or <i>Kayor
    Energy Systems Inc. v. Davies, Ward &amp; Beck, </i>[2001] O.T.C. 468 (S.C.J.)
    support the proposition for which they are cited. </p>

    costs that was delivered to and paid by the school trustees referred for
    taxation.  The Court of Appeal affirmed
    that he was not the person chargeable with the bill or liable to pay it, even
    though he may, ultimately, have had to bear an aliquot portion of it in his
    capacity as a taxpayer.  Mr. McGugan was
    not the client.  His circumstances were
    quite different than those of Estelle Glanc vis-à-vis Hughes Amys LLP.</p>

    Systems Inc. was a shareholder of a Company called Peel Resource Recovery Inc.  The Company borrowed money from a bank and
    was obligated under the loan agreement to pay the bank’s legal fees.  Davies, Ward &amp; Beck acted for the bank
    and rendered accounts that were paid by the Company.  Later, after the Company had paid its
    outstanding indebtedness Kayor sought to have the accounts assessed.  Kayor had sold its shares in the Company at
    the time the indebtedness was paid out, but the bank had declined to release
    the shares until certain other accounts of Davies had been paid.  Justice Dunnet dismissed Kayor’s application
    to have the accounts assessed.  Kayor was
    not the client, nor was it the person chargeable, nor was it a person not
    chargeable but liable to pay.  Kayor had
    not paid the accounts.  Even if Kayor had
    a claim pursuant to an assignment it had taken from the Company, the twelve
    month limitation under s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> had expired and Kayor had failed to establish special circumstances.  The case did not relate to a claim by a
    person responsible for paying only a portion of the account.</p>

    Canada Court of Chancery in Chambers, and on the decision of Master Donkin in <i>Goodman and Carr v. Goldstein Estate</i>,
    [1988] O.J. No. 273 (S.C.), for the proposition that <i>all</i> parties retaining the solicitors must be part of the request to
    assess an account.  While I have some
    reservations about the continuing soundness of that principle as a general proposition
    in the present day – long-standing as it may be – it is not necessary to decide
    the question here because all parties to the retainer are part of the request.  The line of authorities relied upon is
    distinguishable on the basis that it relates to situations in which a client
    has obtained an <i>ex parte</i> registrar’s
    order for assessment by requisition, without notice to the solicitors, whereas
    in the present case Hughes Amys had notice of the client’s initiative and has
    been able to respond.  In any event, although
    Estelle brought forward the motion, she is supported in it by Krysia.  The clients are in agreement about the
    assessment.  Diane’s absence is not
    critical since she did not retain the Hughes Amys firm.</p>

    nothing I say in these reasons is intended to be a reflection on the quantum of
    the accounts or the existence or quantum of any premium.  The resolution of those matters is for
    another day.  It appears evident that the
    O’Donohues and Mr. Fitch provided stellar services to their clients and
    achieved an excellent result.  Indeed,
    nothing in the materials or in the submissions of the appellant’s counsel, Mr.

    to Estelle’s ability to have the accounts assessed.  First, it submits that the steps taken to add
    the Hughes Amys accounts to the O’Donohue assessment were flawed; essentially, the
    process did not constitute an application to refer an account for assessment
    under s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> and
    was not an appropriate procedure for an assessment by requisition under s.
    3.  Secondly, it argues that Estelle is
    out of time even if the process is treated as a s. 4 application because it was
    not commenced within twelve months of the Hughes Amys account being delivered

    J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Public confidence in the administration of
    justice requires the court to intervene where necessary to protect <i>the client’s right to a fair procedure for
    the assessment of a solicitor’s bill</i>.  As a general matter, if a client objects to a solicitor’s account, the
    solicitor should facilitate the assessment process, rather than frustrating the
    process.  See Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., looseleaf (Aurora, Ont.:
    Canada Law Book, 2001), at p. 3-13.  In
    my view, <i>the courts should interpret</i> <i>legislation and</i> <i>procedural rules relating to the assessment of solicitors’ accounts in
    a similar spirit</i>.  As Orkin argues,
    “if the courts permit lawyers to avoid the scrutiny of their accounts for
    fairness and reasonableness, the administration of justice will be brought into
    disrepute.”  <i>The court has an inherent jurisdiction to control the conduct of
    solicitors and its own procedures.  This

    the solicitor objected that the motion had not been brought by a proper form of
    application under s. 11 of the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>.  Justice Sachs disposed of this
    objection stating, “In my view this is precisely the type of procedural
    objection that the court should not be persuaded by in proceedings where a
    client is seeking a fair opportunity to assess a solicitor’s bill.”  Here, I would dispose of the appellant’s
    objection that Estelle should not be permitted to piggy-back her assessment of
    the Hughes Amys accounts onto the requisition proceeding pertaining to the
    O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue in the same fashion.</p>

    well-established that the court has a discretion to direct the assessment of a
    solicitor’s account apart from the provisions of the <i>Solicitor’s Act</i>: see <i>Re Park </i>(1889),
    41 Ch. D. 326 (C.A.); <i>Arnoldi v. Tremaine</i>,
    [1925] 3 D.L.R. 911 at 915-916 (Ont. S.C.C.A.), Middleton J.A.; and <i>Storer &amp; Co. v. Johnson</i> (1890), 15
    App. Cas. 203 (H.L).  In the latter case
    – in which the client was out of time and therefore had no right to tax the
    solicitor’s bill under the U.K. <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> – no less an authority than Lord Halsbury, L.C. said at p. 206:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span>            </span>But
    it was of course open to the Court to pronounce a judgment which should do

    assessed should be dealt with in the same spirit.  In this regard, I note the following in
    particular:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(a)       Estelle and Krysia were not told whether
    the accounts rendered contained substantial premiums.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(b)       They were not told they had the right to
    have the accounts assessed.  Instead,
    their concerns, when raised, were waived off with light banter, Stephen
    O’Donohue suggesting that O’Donohue “could make the bill higher” and Mr. Fitch
    commenting that they were lucky they were not in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    where they would have
    to pay 33% of the gross funds generated.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>I           The circumstances in which the $2.69
    million O’Donohue account and the $696,000 Hughes Amys account were tendered
    did not lend themselves to close scrutiny of the accounts by the sisters.  The accounts were significant and lengthy but
    they were presented at the time of the first settlement closing when Estelle
    and Krysia were about to receive over half a million dollars each and when
    they, perhaps understandably, might be less critical and vigilant.  Although they were concerned about the
    accounts, Estelle and Krysia had little opportunity to review them or to seek
    professional advice, and Estelle states in her affidavit that she was of the
    view that she had no choice but to sign the direction and that, if she did not,
    neither Krysia nor she would receive their distributions.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(d)       There was no inordinate delay on the part
    of Estelle (ultimately supported by Krysia) in seeking to have either the
    O’Donohue &amp; O’Donohue or the Hughes Amys accounts assessed.  She only discovered during the Fall of 2004,
    through enquiries of her personal counsel, that the O’Donohue accounts
    contained an undisclosed premium of $1.2 million.  On December 15, 2004, she obtained an order
    on requisition to assess those accounts.  While this may have been outside the one month time limit for obtaining
    such an order on requisition,<a href="#_ftn1"

    was well within the time period prescribed for an application for assessment
    under s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  </p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(e)       At around the same time, Estelle’s
    counsel asked for Mr. Fitch’s consent to add the Hughes Amys accounts to the
    O’Donohue assessment.  This request –
    which was repeated in January 2005 and again in July and August 2005 – was
    refused.  The formal motion to add the
    Hughes Amys accounts to the O’Donohue assessment was brought in December 2005.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(f)        Estelle had attempted to persuade the
    new C.E.O. of Everlast, Tom Welsh, to have Everlast assess the accounts.  Everlast declined to do so.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(g)       Finally, while the attempt to add the
    Hughes Amys assessment to the O’Donohue proceeding may have been irregular, I
    can see no prejudice to Hughes Amys resulting from the irregularity.  The law firm has had ample opportunity to
    defend the proceeding and, as noted above, was well aware of Estelle’s desire
    to have the accounts assessed in a timely fashion once the existence of the
    premium was discovered.</p>
