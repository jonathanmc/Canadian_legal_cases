  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues on this appeal have their genesis in a business
    deal involving the sale of two
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    businesses owned by the respondent, Robert Chenier.  The appellant, Pierre Cyr – acting through
    his companies – was the intended purchaser.  One of the transactions closed.  The other did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three lawsuits ensued.  The first (the “VTB Loan Action”) involved a claim by one of the Chenier
    vendor companies for the balance of the purchase price on the sale of its
    assets.  The second (the “Wrongful
    Dismissal Action”) was by Mr. Chenier for monies owing under a management
    consultant agreement entered into with respect to that asset transaction.  The third (the “Cyr Action”) was brought by
    Mr. Cyr and his companies claiming damages from Mr. Chenier and his companies
    for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of good faith, and
    breach of a duty to avoid conflict of interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a four week trial, Justice Polowin allowed the
    Chenier claims in the Loan Action and the Wrongful Dismissal Action and
    dismissed the Cyr Action.  The Cyr
    appellants now seek to set aside those judgments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeals.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chenier owned a food distribution company, I.C.B.
    Distributions Inc. (“I.C.B.”), based in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  He also owned a freezer and cold storage
    business carried on through Ottawa Freezer Services Inc. (“O.F.S.”) in premises
    located at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    400 Industrial Ave.
    in that city.  Mr. Chenier had had some
    health problems and wished to semi-retire and work fewer hours.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cyr owned an unrelated food distribution company
    that carried on business as C.Y.R. Distributions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></a>  It rented cooler and freezer space from O.F.S.
    in the latter’s premises at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    400
    Industrial Ave. and, as a result, Mr. Cyr had some
    exposure to Mr. Chenier’s businesses.  He
    felt there was a potential synergy between those operations and his own and, in
    particular, that the wider territory served by I.C.B. and its access to
    distribution business flowing from the O.F.S. storage contracts presented an
    opportunity to expand the scope of C.Y.R. Distributions’ undertaking (which, at
    that point in time had become saturated in Ottawa).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When their mutual interests surfaced in September or
    October 2000, Mr. Chenier and Mr. Cyr began to have discussions about the possible
    acquisition of I.C.B. and O.F.S. by Mr. Cyr.  The deal they negotiated contemplated the purchase of the assets of
    I.C.B. by I.C.B. Distribution 2001 (“I.C.B. 2001”)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></a> for approximately $362,500, and of the shares of O.F.S. by C.Y.R. Distributions
    for approximately $500,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several agreements were entered into thereafter to give
    effect to these intentions.  They
    included the following in relation to the acquisition of I.C.B.’s assets: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(a)       an
    Asset Purchase Agreement, which contained two important promises for the purposes
    of this appeal, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(i)        a covenant by I.C.B. and Mr. Chenier not
    to compete with the purchased business for a period of five years, or to permit
    anyone on their behalf to do so (s. 7.5); and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(ii)       an
    undertaking by I.C.B. and Mr. Chenier to obtain the commitment of O.F.S. to
    continue to use the services of the Purchaser for distribution services in
    respect of O.F.S.’s customers and to permit the Purchaser to operate from the
    O.F.S. premises at 400 Industrial Ave. in Ottawa (s. 8.1(i)); </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(b)       a
    Management Consulting Agreement pursuant to which Mr. Chenier was to provide
    consulting services as requested during a transitional period; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(c)       a
    Vendor Take-Back Loan Agreement respecting the loan portion of the asset
    purchase price. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The I.C.B. asset purchase closed on July 11, 2001.  No share purchase agreement with respect to O.F.S.
    had been executed at that point, however, and Mr. Cyr refused to complete the
    asset purchase without one being in place.  As a result, there were intense negotiations during the evening and
    night of the closing, which resulted in two further agreements being prepared
    and signed by the parties prior to the asset purchase closing.  They were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a Share Purchase Agreement between Mr.
    Chenier as vendor of the O.F.S. shares and Mr. Cyr and C.Y.R. Distributions as
    purchasers; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a Mutual Undertaking between I.C.B. 2001 and
    O.F.S., giving effect to the covenant in Section 8.1(i) of the Asset Purchase
    Agreement whereby O.F.S. agreed to provide to I.C.B. 2001 (as the Purchaser of
    the assets of I.C.B.) a right of first refusal for its customers’ distribution
    contracts and the right to operate from the I.C.B. premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions of the Mutual Undertaking are central to
    the issues on this appeal.  It is a one page
    document.  I set it out in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    (“PURCHASER”) and OTTAWA FREEZER SERVICES INC.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Re:      Purchase of certain assets of ICB Food
    Distributions Inc. pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated the 19<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2001, by 3869130 CANADA INC. (the “Purchaser”) and continuing
    operations from

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>1.  The
    Vendor has entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (the “Purchase
    Agreement”) effective the 28<sup>th</sup> day of February, whereby the Vendor
    agrees to sell certain assets of ICB Food distributions Inc. (the “Business”);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>2.  And
    whereas, as a condition of the completion of the said sale of the Business, it
    was agreed that the Purchaser would provide its written commitment to operate
    exclusively from the Ottawa Freezer Service’s premises from which the Vendor
    operated prior to the Closing Date at 400 Industrial Ave. (the “Premises”)
    until December 28, 2005, or until the early termination of the Ottawa Freezer
    Services sub-lease by the Sub-Landlord of the Premises, whichever is earlier.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>3.  And
    whereas, it was further agreed between the Vendor and the Purchaser that the
    gross annual charge payable by the Purchaser for the right to operate from the
    Premises shall be $120,000.00, annually, for each year of operation to December
    28, 2005.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>IN CONSIDERATION of the sum of
    $2.00 the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Ottawa Freezer Services does
    hereby undertake and agree to provide to the Purchaser a first right of
    refusal, in writing for all distribution contracts for its customers for which
    the same require distribution and general trucking and delivery services and
    the right to operate from the Premises for a period of five years from the date
    hereof, except that, should the sale of shares of Ottawa Freezer Services Inc.
    to Pierre Cyr and 2794209 Canada Inc. pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement
    dated the 11<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2001, not be completed by November 30<sup>th</sup>,

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regrettably, the relationship between Mr. Cyr and Mr.
    Chenier – which had started out very cordially and positively after the Letters
    of Intent were signed in February – began to fragment in the Fall of 2001, and
    eventually ruptured in early 2002.  The share
    purchase transaction never closed, principally because the parties were not
    able to obtain an extension of the sublease from Loeb or a new head-lease for
    the O.F.S. premises (a condition precedent to closing) and because Mr. Chenier
    and his lawyer were not satisfied with the disclosure and security that Mr. Cyr
    was providing respecting the share purchase (a condition in favour of the
    vendor).  Thus, instead of controlling
    both the former I.C.B. distribution business and the O.F.S. storage facility,
    Mr. Cyr found himself controlling only the former.  Instead of being semi-retired and working on
    a part-time consulting basis for his old business, Mr. Chenier found himself
    still controlling and directing the O.F.S. storage undertaking.  The business relationship could not, and did
    not, survive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Differences arose during the Fall of 2001 over the use
    of the storage premises at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    400
    Industrial Ave., the amount of space allotted to
    the Cyr companies, and their access to the loading docks.  Some of these differences were attributable
    to a new arrangement entered into between O.F.S. and one of its major customers
    – the wholesaler of frozen and fresh food products, Giant Tiger Stores Limited
    – with respect to the storage, warehousing and distribution of Giant Tiger
    products.  As a result of this

    15,000 sq. ft. front freezer.  O.F.S.’s
    other customers, including I.C.B. 2001 and C.Y.R. Distributions, were relocated
    to a smaller 4,900 sq. ft. area at the back.  The increased Giant Tiger presence contributed to congestion in the
    loading dock area and to inefficiencies in the use of that area, which were a
    further irritant to everyone.</p>

    2002 that he was moving the operations of <i>both</i> C.Y.R. Distributions and I.C.B. 2001 to

    Mutual Undertaking.  The Loan Action was
    commenced shortly thereafter.</p>

    I.C.B. 2001 pursuant to the Management Consulting Agreement.  He was also managing and operating O.F.S.  The trial judge found that by October 2001
    the relationship between Mr. Cyr and Mr. Chenier had seriously deteriorated,
    and that the parties were treating each other at arm’s length and dealing with
    each other as two separate companies throughout the Fall of 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 25, 2002, Mr. Cyr’s lawyers wrote to Mr.
    Chenier’s lawyers complaining, amongst other things, of Mr. Chenier’s
    performance under the Management Consulting Agreement and purporting to give
    six months notice of termination in accordance with its terms.  Mr. Chenier took this as a breach of the
    Management Consulting Agreement.  He
    commenced the Wrongful Dismissal Action shortly thereafter.</p>

    central to the commencement of the Cyr action some time later, was the shadow
    of Giant Tiger.  The Giant Tiger
    operations had been consuming more and more of the O.F.S. storage facilities –
    by mid-2000 it was occupying approximately 12,000 sq. ft. of the front freezer
    area – and negotiations respecting a new and larger Giant Tiger storage and
    distribution contract between it and O.F.S. had begun in late Spring 2001.  This increasing Giant Tiger presence was the source
    of much of the chafing over the storage area and the loading facilities, and the
    potential new contract was a focal point of much of Mr. Chenier’s attention throughout
    the Fall of 2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Negotiations respecting this contract had begun much
    earlier in the year.  In June 2001, Mr.
    Cyr and his financial advisor, Mr. Luigi, attended a meeting with Mr. Chenier
    and representatives of Giant Tiger in which a proposal was made by the
    Chenier/Cyr group to Giant Tiger.  Under
    this proposal – which was contained in a letter dated June 26, 2001, signed by
    Mr. Chenier, but drafted by Mr. Luigi – O.F.S. was to receive 68¢ per case for
    delivery of the Giant Tiger product.  Giant
    Tiger was by this time occupying about 12,000 sq. ft. in the freezer and the
    trial judge found that Mr. Cyr must have been aware by as early as June, 2001
    that if they were successful in wrestling the Giant Tiger business away from
    its existing service provider, Giant Tiger would be occupying about 15,000 ft.
    in the freezer.</p>

line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that Mr. Chenier carried the
    negotiations with Giant Tiger.  The Cyr
    parties complain that he negotiated with Giant Tiger in secret, deliberately
    keeping the details of the negotiations from Mr. Cyr so that he could
    personally benefit from the Giant Tiger arrangement.  The trial judge found, however, that although
    Mr. Chenier did not disclose the particulars of the Giant Tiger contract – she
    held that a contractor had no obligation to disclose such details to a
    subcontractor – Mr. Cyr was aware that Mr. Chenier was negotiating with Giant
    Tiger for a comprehensive contract and that the distribution work would be
    contracted out.  Mr. Cyr admitted in
    evidence that he never asked Mr. Chenier about the particulars of the contract
    with Giant Tiger.  </p>

    respect to the delivery services arising out of the O.F.S./Giant Tiger
    contract.  On October 5, 2001, Mr. Cyr
    wrote to Mr. Chenier confirming I.C.B. 2001’s “agreement to act as Ottawa
    Freezer’s agents in distributing Giant Tiger’s frozen and cooled products” at a
    cost to O.F.S. of 30¢ a case.  After further
    exchanges the bid was re-submitted on October 31, 2001 stipulating a price of
    35¢ a case for the same services, i.e., for “[acting] as Ottawa Freezer’s
    agents in distributing Giant Tiger’s frozen and cooled products.”  A formal agreement was executed between O.F.S.
    and Giant Tiger as of November 2, 2001.  It provided for distribution services at 65¢ per case.  A formal Distribution Agreement was executed
    between O.F.S. and I.C.B. 2001 on December 14, 2001 at a delivery tariff of 35¢
    per case. </p>

    principal bone of contention between the parties in the Cyr action.  Mr. Cyr contends that it was not open to Mr.
    Chenier and O.F.S. to take a profit on the distribution end of the Giant Tiger
    contract by subcontracting that work to I.C.B. 2001 for a lower price than that

    decisive in determining the meaning of the document. However, the former cannot
    be equated with the latter. The meaning of a document is derived not just from
    the words used, but from the context or the circumstances in which the words
    were used. Professor John Swan puts it well in <i>Canadian Contract Law</i> (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2006) at 493:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:

    features of language that need to be noted. Few, if any words, can be
    understood apart from their context and no contractual language can be
    understood without some knowledge of its context and the purpose of the
    contract. Words, taken individually, have an inherent vagueness that will often
    require courts to determine their meaning by looking at their context and the
    expectations that the parties may have had.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    was made is an integral part of the interpretative process and is not something
    that is resorted to only where the words viewed in isolation suggest some
    ambiguity. To find ambiguity, one must come to certain conclusions as to the
    meaning of the words used. A conclusion as to the meaning of words used in a
    written contract can only be properly reached if the contract is considered in
    the context in which it was made: see McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2005) at 710-11.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    provided by Lord Justice Steyn, &quot;The Intracticable Problem of the
    Interpretation of Legal Texts&quot;, <i>supra,</i> at 8:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>In sharp
    contrast with civil legal systems the common law adopts a largely objective
    theory to the interpretation of contracts. <i>The
    purpose of the interpretation of a contract is not to discover how the parties
    understood the language of the text, which they adopted. The aim is to
    determine the meaning of the contract against its objective contextual scene.
    By and large the objective approach to the question of construction serves the
    needs of commerce.</i></p>

    present context.  The Cyr parties and the
    Chenier parties entered into a series of contracts in order to give effect to
    the “deal” whereby Mr. Cyr was to acquire both the I.C.B. and O.F.S.
    operations.  While the Mutual Undertaking
    was not signed at the same time as the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
    commitments it contains were contemplated in the latter Agreement and formed
    part of the same global transaction.  In
    these circumstances, the court must have regard not only to the language of the
    particular contract that is being interpreted (the Mutual Undertaking or the
    Non-Competition covenant), taken as a whole, but to the surrounding contracts
    as well.  As Professor John D. McCamus

    commercial transactions such as the purchase and sale of a large and complex
    business, may involve the execution of several agreements.  In such contexts, it is an interesting
    question, then, whether in the interpretation of one of the agreements, regard
    may be had to the others.  <i>The basic principle is that such regard may
    be had only where the agreements essentially form components of one larger
    transaction.  Where each agreement is
    entered into on the faith of the others being executed and where it is intended
    that each agreement form part of a larger composite whole, assistance in the

    trial judge should have interpreted to words “<i>to continue</i> to use the services of the Purchaser” [emphasis added]
    in s. 8.1(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement to encompass a proviso that the
    relationship would continue to operate in such a fashion after the asset
    purchase transaction, and even if the share purchase transaction were not
    completed.  They argue that this
    opportunity was the “goodwill” of the business purchased by I.C.B. 2001 for
    which it agreed to pay $192,500.  </p>

    from using O.F.S., indirectly, to derive a benefit for himself and his company
    from the distribution portion of the O.F.S. contracts.  In their view, Mr. Chenier should not be
    permitted to circumvent his obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement not
    to compete for that business.  In
    particular, they insist, he was prohibited from dealing with the Giant Tiger

    business, and from causing any of his companies to do so.  The Mutual Undertaking – through the use of
    the words “<i>to continue to use</i> the

    an error of law attracting review on the standard of correctness.  To the extent that the contract

    covenant did not stand alone and had to be read in light of the Mutual
    Undertaking, and (ii) that the Mutual Undertaking was the mechanism created by
    the parties to give effect to s. 8.1(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement whereby
    I.C.B. and Mr. Chenier agreed to obtain O.F.S.’s commitment to continue to use
    the services of the Purchaser for O.F.S.’s distribution services to its
    customers.  She concluded that the Mutual
    Undertaking gave to I.C.B. 2001 a right of first refusal for all distribution
    contracts for O.F.S.’s customers requiring distribution, trucking, and delivery
    services, and held that I.C.B. 2001 was provided with such a right of first
    refusal with respect to the Giant Tiger contract.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    refusal contemplated a subcontracting arrangement between O.F.S. and I.C.B.
    2001 and that it was accordingly irrelevant whether O.F.S. made a profit on the
    subcontracting arrangement.  Moreover,
    the trial judge reasoned that the conduct of the parties following the
    execution of the Mutual Undertaking was in harmony with, and reinforced, her
    conclusions.  </p>

    documentation entered into by the parties – and particularly of the interplay
    between the Mutual Undertaking and the provisions of ss. 7.5 and 8.1(i) of the
    Asset Purchase Agreement – is the proper one, in my view.  On the contractual principles canvassed above,
    the two documents are to be read and interpreted together, not in isolation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    Undertaking make any reference to the terms on which I.C.B. 2001 is to provide
    distribution services to O.F.S.’s customers, including the price.  However, the trial judge’s interpretation is
    the most faithful to the language of the documentation, having regard to the
    factual matrix in which the contracts were made, and makes commercial sense.  Indeed, her view is in keeping with the
    appellants’ theory that the purpose of s. 8.1(i) was to protect the goodwill
    purchased by I.C.B. 2001, although not necessarily in the fashion the
    appellants contend.  </p>

    and I.C.B. 2001 as one of “contractor/subcontractor” is the most apposite
    approach is not really important.  The
    notion that O.F.S. would enter into a comprehensive arrangement with its
    customers and subsequently in some fashion contract out the distribution
    component of that arrangement to others – affording I.C.B. 2001 the first right
    of refusal on that work – is clearly what the parties had in mind in the Asset
    Purchase Agreement, as given effect to by the Mutual Undertaking.  The Non-Competition covenant must be given
    effect in that context.  I reach these
    conclusions for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First – and to reiterate – the specific obligation of
    I.C.B. and Mr. Chenier under s. 8.1(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement was to
    obtain O.F.S.’s two-fold commitment (a) “to continue to use the services of the
    Purchaser … for distribution services in respect of Ottawa Freezer Services
    Inc. customers”, and (b) “to permit the Purchaser … to operate from [the O.F.S.
    premises].”  These obligations were
    mutually beneficial.  The right to bid on
    the distribution services in respect of O.F.S.’s customers was of considerable
    importance to the Cyr parties, as purchasers, and the ability to operate from
    the O.F.S. premises would enable them to do so more efficiently and at less
    cost.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></a>  Further, having I.C.B. 2001 as a tenant of
    its storage facilities and available to provide the distribution services for its
    customers was advantageous to O.F.S.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mutual Undertaking gave effect to both of these
    requirements.  It adopted the device of a
    right of first refusal to ensure that O.F.S. would continue to use the services
    of I.C.B. 2001 for the distribution services required by its customers.  And it gave I.C.B. 2001 the right to operate
    from the O.F.S. premises at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    400
    Industrial Ave. for a period of five years.  Of some significance – because it indicates
    the parties recognized the share transaction might not close, and because it
    reflects the benefits flowing from having the distribution operations running
    from the O.F.S. storage premises – the Mutual Undertaking provides for a
    reduction in the gross annual charge for the use of the premises from the
    $120,000 agreed to in the Asset Purchase Agreement to $90,000 in the event the
    transaction was not completed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, while I accept that I.C.B. 2001 paid a
    considerable sum for the “goodwill” of I.C.B., I do not agree with Mr. Marks’
    submission that what I.C.B. 2001 was entitled to acquire in this respect were
    all of the distribution contracts entered into by O.F.S. in the future – even
    if the share purchase transaction were not completed – including all of the
    revenues generated by that component of the O.F.S. contracts.  Mr. Marks focuses on two provisions in the
    Asset Purchase Agreement in support of this argument: s. 2.1(f) incorporates
    “contracts to provide goods or services entered into after February 28<sup>th</sup>,
    2001” as part of the assets purchased, and s. 3.2(c) allocates $192,500 of the
    purchase price to the “[g]oodwill of the … business as set out in section
    2.1(f) hereof”.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation reflects a misreading of s. 2.1(f)
    and its purpose, however.  A review of s.
    2.1 as a whole demonstrates that the purpose of subsection 2.1(f) is to catch
    all contracts for goods and services entered into <i>by I.C.B.</i>, the asset vendor, between the date of the Letter of
    Intent (February 28, 2001) and the date the asset transaction closed (July 11,
    2001).  It has nothing to do with future
    contracts entered into <i>by O.F.S</i>.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the circumstances surrounding the execution of
    the Mutual Undertaking – the factual matrix – support the trial judge’s
    interpretation of the contractual framework between the parties.  To begin with, the parties contemplated that
    the share transaction might not be completed.  It was subject to several covenants for the benefit of either of the
    vendor or purchaser which could be waived and, most importantly, a true
    condition precedent which neither party could waive, namely, obtaining the
    consent of Loeb to extend the 400 Industrial Ave. sublease or obtaining a new
    head-lease.  I note as well that the
    Mutual Undertaking specifically contemplated a reduction in annual rent from
    I.C.B. 2001 if the share transaction did not close.  In that event, the distribution company
    (I.C.B. 2001, as purchaser of the I.C.B. assets) and the freezer/cold storage
    company (O.F.S.) would no longer be part of the same business enterprise and
    would be operating at arm’s length.  This
    would result in a situation quite different from that which prevailed when
    I.C.B. and O.F.S. were sister companies in the same corporate family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the right of first refusal itself
    contemplates that there may be distribution contracts for O.F.S. customers that
    I.C.B. 2001 may not take up. What could the parties have intended would happen
    in the event that the share transaction failed to close but I.C.B. 2001
    declined to accept a distribution contract for one of O.F.S.’s storage
    customers?  Mr. Marks conceded that, if
    the appellants are correct in their interpretation of the effect of the Non-Competition
    covenant, O.F.S. would simply be barred from contracting the declined
    distribution work out to someone else as long as Mr. Chenier remained its
    operating mind.  This interpretation
    makes no commercial sense.  O.F.S. would
    be left with mounting inventories of perishable products in its cold
    storage/freezer premises with no ability to move them or to honour its
    distribution commitments to its customers.  At best, O.F.S. would be left in a disadvantageous position in obtaining
    cold storage/freezer business because it would be at the mercy of I.C.B. 2001
    before it could bind itself to furnish distribution services to its
    customers.  It is absurd that the parties
    would have intended such a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does it make any commercial sense that, if the share
    transaction failed to close, Mr. Chenier and O.F.S. would simply agree to turn
    over to I.C.B. 2001 – on a sort of turn-key basis – the distribution portion of
    the their customers’ contracts as negotiated.  Parties negotiating a multi-faceted agreement may be more concerned
    about the overall price arrived at than they are about the individual
    components of that price.  It may suit a
    customer to have a lower storage price component and a higher distribution
    price component to the contract, or it may suit them to have the reverse.  Why should I.C.B. 2001 benefit from the
    former situation at O.F.S.’s expense when those two entities are operating at
    arm’s length just because O.F.S. is obliged to give it a right of first refusal
    to provide the distribution services in relation to that particular contract?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, even if O.F.S. could theoretically benefit
    from negotiating an unduly high storage price and an unduly low distribution
    price, the evidence in this case suggests that it did not.  O.F.S. offered to and contracted with I.C.B.
    2001 for the Giant Tiger distribution contract at a rate of 35¢ per case.  Despite the fact that O.F.S. had contracted
    with Giant Tiger at a rate of 65¢ per case, the fact remains that 35¢ per case
    for distribution services was reasonable.  The trial judge notes at para. 420:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Moreover, it seems to me that the best
    indicator to the Court that the 35 cents per case rate was not outside the
    realm of the reasonable herein was that when Mr. Cyr refused to undertake the
    distribution work for Giant Tiger for 2003, although offered to him at 40 cents
    a case pursuant to the right of refusal, S &amp; M Delivery Service contracted
    for that work at 38 cents a case, and still performs same today, now at 40
    cents a case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

    which a new proposal was presented to Giant Tiger.  This proposal was reflected in a letter dated
    June 26, 2001, signed by Mr. Chenier on behalf of O.F.S., <i>but drafted by Mr. Cyr’s financial advisor, Mr. Luigi</i>.  The letter clearly indicated that O.F.S. was
    proposing to provide the distribution services to Giant Tiger at a per-case
    price of 68¢.  Mr. Cyr therefore knew
    prior to the negotiation and execution of the Mutual Undertaking – or, at
    least, his representative did – what O.F.S. and Mr. Chenier proposed to charge
    Giant Tiger for distribution.  Indeed,
    the trial judge found at para. 421 of her reasons that “Mr. Cyr himself was
    aware, or had to have been aware, that O.F.S. was making money on the Giant
    Tiger distribution work.”  This finding
    is amply supported in the evidence.</p>

    Mutual Undertaking was simply to turn over its customers’ distribution
    contracts to I.C.B. 2001 at the price O.F.S. and its customer negotiated for
    delivery.  At the same time, the notion
    that any increase in delivery rates is to be split 50/50 is entirely consistent
    with the recognition that some of the revenue from the distribution portion of
    O.F.S.’s contract with its customer is to go to O.F.S.  Indeed, the 50/50 division is not far from

    incentive to O.F.S. to negotiate a better deal.  I do not think the language supports this contention, however.  If Mr. Marks were correct, the provision

    in writing.  </p>

    Purchase Agreement.  Rather, she
    correctly interpreted and read the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Mutual
    Undertaking together, and in their appropriate contexts.  She concluded that the right of first refusal
    in the Mutual Undertaking was simply the mechanism chosen by the parties to
    give effect to the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement which required I.C.B.
    and Mr. Chenier to get O.F.S. onside “to continue to use the services of the
    Purchaser [I.C.B. 2001] for distribution services in respect of Ottawa Freezer
    Service’s customers”.  However, there is
    nothing in the Asset Purchase Agreement or the Mutual Undertaking – or in any
    of the other contractual documentation entered into between the parties –
    requiring O.F.S. “to continue to use the services” in accordance with the same
    inter-company arrangements that were in place when O.F.S. and I.C.B. were
    sister companies in the same business enterprise.  For the reasons I have expressed above, it
    makes no commercial sense that that should be the case in circumstances where –
    as everyone recognized might be the case – the share purchase transaction
    failed to close and I.C.B. 2001 and O.F.S. were operating at arm’s length.</p>

    various erroneous inferences of fact from the evidence which led her into the
    error of finding that the Mutual Undertaking had modified the provisions of the
    Asset Purchase Agreement.  The precise
    inferences complained of are not easy to ascertain from the appellants’
    argument, but they appear to include findings such as the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(a)       Mr. Chenier was not
    negotiating the Giant Tiger arrangement for I.C.B. 2001 but for O.F.S.;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(b)       O.F.S. was entitled to
    make a profit on the distribution component of the Giant Tiger contract; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(c)       Mr. Cyr had gone to
    Giant Tiger himself during the Fall of 2001 to attempt to contract for the
    distribution work; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(d)       Paragraph 5 of the
    Distribution Agreement between O.F.S. and I.C.B. 2001 confirmed an

    inferences – to the extent they were inferences drawn by the trial judge – are
    essentially an attempt to re-try the case.  With the possible exception of the finding that Mr. Cyr had gone to
    Giant Tiger himself to attempt to negotiate a distribution contract and was
    rebuffed – an inference which I think played little role in her overall
    conclusions – the findings of fact that she made and the inferences she drew
    from those facts were all open to her on the record.  Specifically, her finding at para. 421 that
    “Mr. Cyr himself was aware, or had to have been aware, that O.F.S. was making
    money on the Giant Tiger distribution work”, cited earlier in these reasons, is
    amply justified by the evidence, also canvassed earlier in these reasons.</p>

    or to any other agreement respecting the Chenier/Cyr “deal” other than the
    Mutual Undertaking.  Mr. Chenier did
    covenant not to compete with the Purchased Business, however.  So far as it is relevant, s. 7.5 of the Asset
    Purchase Agreement states:</p>

    distribution business, with some emphasis on cooled and frozen food
    products.  On its face, and in isolation,
    the Non-Competition covenant might be read as an impediment to the contract
    entered into between O.F.S. and Giant Tiger and the subsequent Distribution
    Agreement between O.F.S. and I.C.B. 2001.  As the trial judge observed at para. 406, however, “[t]he
    non-competition provision contained in subparagraph 7.5 of the Asset Purchase
    Agreement does not stand alone.”  It must
    be read and construed in the context of the asset and share purchase
    transactions, and the various agreements entered into in connection with them
    viewed as a whole.  When that is done, it
    is apparent the trial judge’s finding that the Chenier parties were not in
    breach of the Non-Competition covenant is supported on the record.  </p>

    relation to the contractual interpretation point.  Given the commercial reality that the parties
    had entered into <i>two </i>different but
    related transactions, either one of which might not close, the wording of the
    Non-Competition covenant is completely inconsistent with the view that it was
    aimed at the activities of O.F.S., or Mr. Chenier’s activities in relation to
    O.F.S., at all.  The parties could not
    have expected both (i) that if the share transaction did not close, Mr. Chenier
    would continue to operate O.F.S. and to enter into comprehensive
    storage/distribution contracts with its customers, and (ii) that he would not
    be entitled to “carry on, or be engaged in, concerned with or have any financial
    or other interest in, directly or indirectly, any undertaking which is <i>in whole or in part competitive</i> with the

    contracts with its customers, in conjunction with its storage contracts, and
    that I.C.B. 2001 would be given the right to bid on the distribution services
    arising out of those contracts.  O.F.S.
    has no trucks and has never done delivery and distribution work. The parties
    could not have intended – in the event the share purchase transaction was not
    completed – that O.F.S. would not be able to service those contracts by
    subcontracting to someone else if I.C.B. 2001 declined to take up its right of

    Chenier was not in a position to negotiate the transaction with Giant Tiger for
    the delivery of its products and to benefit personally from that
    transaction.  As such, they rely on <i>Read v. Cole </i>(1915), 52 S.C.R. 176 and

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The covenant not to compete as contained in
    the Asset Purchase Agreement does not stand alone in this case.  It must be read in context.  In the face of the covenant not to compete,
    the parties turned their minds to distribution work and entered into the Mutual
    Undertaking, with the understanding and intent that any distribution work which
    O.F.S. might obtain from its customers would be first offered to I.C.B.
    2001.  The Mutual Undertaking
    contemplated and provided that O.F.S. would subcontract out this work to I.C.B.
    2001 pursuant to the right of first refusal.  It stated that O.F.S. would provide I.C.B. 2001 “a first right of
    refusal, in writing for all <i>distribution
    contracts</i> for its customers for which same require distribution …” (emphasis
    mine).  The Mutual Undertaking
    contemplated that O.F.S. could obtain distribution contracts. [Emphasis in

    intended that O.F.S. would enter into distribution contracts with its customers.  The parties contemplated that the share
    purchase transaction might not close.  They recognized that O.F.S. would be operating at arm’s length to I.C.B.
    2001 if that were the case.  They knew
    that O.F.S. was Mr. Chenier’s company.  In
    this context, Mr. Chenier’s covenant not to compete ought not to be interpreted
    in a manner that would preclude O.F.S. from entering into its storage and

    and I.C.B. 2001 regarding the Giant Tiger distribution work as creating a state
    of affairs in which Mr. Chenier or his company are <i>competing</i> with I.C.B. 2001.  If
    the Chenier parties are disqualified from entering into such an arrangement
    with I.C.B. 2001, in my view, it must be because the contractual documentation
    did not permit it – an interpretation I have rejected for the reasons set out

    putting himself in a position where his interests conflicted with those of
    I.C.B. 2001.  In the context of this

    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377 at 381, and <i>Cadbury
    Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd</i>., [1999] 1 S.C.R. 142 at para. 30.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that Mr. Chenier was the
    equivalent of “top management” with an obligation to promote the business
    interests of I.C.B. 2001.  Accordingly,
    they contend, he was precluded from putting himself in a position of conflict
    of interest with I.C.B. 2001 and from, in effect, stealing a corporate opportunity
    from I.C.B. 2001 by skimming 30¢ per case off the price obtained from Giant
    Tiger for distributing its products.  In
    this respect they rely upon the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Canadian Aero Services Limited v. O’Malley</i>,
    [1974] S.C.R. 592.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected this argument.  She concluded that the relationship between
    Mr. Chenier and the Chenier parties did not meet the criteria for a fiduciary
    relationship.  Many authorities have
    dealt with those criteria, but the common characteristics of a fiduciary
    relationship as enumerated by Wilson J. in dissent in <i>Frame v. Smith</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99 have since been accepted by the
    Supreme Court of Canada as setting out a rough and ready guide for the
    existence of such a relationship: see <i>Lac
    Minerals Ltd. V. International Corona Resources</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574 at
    577-578, Sopinka J.; and <i>Hodgkinson v.
    Simms</i> at 379.  At p. 136 in <i>Frame v. Smith</i>, Wilson J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Yet there are common features discernible in the contexts in which
    fiduciary duties have been found to exist and these common features do provide
    a rough and ready guide to whether or not the imposition of a fiduciary
    obligation on a new relationship would be appropriate and consistent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Relationships in which a
    fiduciary obligation has been imposed seem to possess three general
    characteristics:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect
    the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary
    holding the discretion or power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the parties to the
    Cyr/Chenier commercial transaction were of equal strength and expertise.  There was no imbalance, dependency, or
    vulnerability in the relationship between them.  She rejected the submission that Mr. Cyr and Mr. Chenier were partners,
    finding that there was nothing in the various agreements entered into that
    would support the existence of such a relationship.  The trial judge found as well that Mr.
    Chenier was not part of I.C.B. 2001’s senior management as a result of his
    association with I.C.B. 2001 under the Management Consulting Agreement.  Instead, she concluded, he was retained as a
    consultant to perform certain duties at the request of Mr. Cyr, and the duties
    he was retained to perform did not place him in a fiduciary relationship with
    the appellants.  These factual
    determinations are all supported on the record and are dispositive of the
    fiduciary argument, in my opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that Mr. Chenier was given
    complete discretion and control over the negotiations with Giant Tiger, thus
    creating the unilateral exercise of discretion/vulnerability dynamic that is generally
    characteristic of a fiduciary relationship.  Mr. Chenier abused that position, they contend, when he caused O.F.S. to
    enter into the distribution component of the Giant Tiger agreement at a rate of
    65¢ per case and then to subcontract that work to I.C.B. 2001 at 35¢ per
    case.  In my view, however, the trial judge
    properly rejected this position, having regard to the Mutual Undertaking the
    parties had negotiated.  She correctly
    noted at para. 440:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>… Mr. Chenier did not negotiate
    with Giant Tiger on behalf of I.C.B. 2001.  Mr. Chenier negotiated a comprehensive agreement with Giant Tiger for
    O.F.S. and for its benefit.  It was
    always understood that the distribution aspect of that comprehensive agreement
    would be subcontracted out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the Mutual Undertaking the parties had
    specifically agreed that I.C.B. 2001 would be given a first right of refusal
    “for all distribution contracts for its [O.F.S.’s] customers”.  The distribution contracts referred to must
    be contracts between O.F.S. and its customers, not contracts between I.C.B.
    2001 and O.F.S.’s customers negotiated through the auspices of Mr. Chenier
    acting on behalf of I.C.B. 2001.  As Mr.
    Cyr’s correspondence tendering the bid for the Giant Tiger distribution work
    demonstrates, Mr. Cyr was well aware that I.C.B. 2001 was acting “as Ottawa
    Freezer’s agents in distributing Giant Tiger’s frozen and cooled products.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial judge disposed of the corporate
    opportunity and conflict of interest arguments with this summary at paras.
    446-447 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The Cyr parties submitted the proposition that where a person has a
    role in the business which is beyond that of a mere obedient servant, then such
    person stands in a fiduciary relationship requiring loyalty, good faith and
    avoidance of a conflict of duty and self-interest.  It is submitted that the relationship will
    include a prohibition against the party acquiring for himself the opportunity
    sought by the party for whom he is negotiating.  <i>Canadian Aero, supra</i>, is cited
    for this proposition, along with <i>Schauenburg
    Industries Ltd. v. Borowski</i> (1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 737.  The case at hand can be clearly distinguished
    from the two cited.  Mr. Chenier was not
    a senior officer of I.C.B. 2001, nor part of its top management.  This is not a case of an employee acquiring
    for himself either secretly or without the approval of the company, any
    property or business advantage belonging to the company or for which he has
    been negotiating.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I repeat, Mr. Chenier was acting pursuant to
    the Mutual Undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For similar reasons, and because of the nature of the
    contractual relationship between the parties as outlined above, the appellants’
    claim that Mr. Chenier is in breach of a duty to avoid conflicts of interest
    also fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge dismissed all of the Cyr
    parties’ allegations that Mr. Chenier had acted in bad faith in his dealings
    with Mr. Cyr.  Those allegations included
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that, in

    the Giant Tiger negotiations with a view to obtaining a personal benefit;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that he

'>(e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that he

    transaction so that he could keep the lucrative Giant Tiger contract for
    himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s factual findings, amply supported in

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I would not give effect to the appellants’
