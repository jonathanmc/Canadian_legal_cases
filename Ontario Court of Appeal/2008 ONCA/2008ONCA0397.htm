    issued and executed in connection with the police investigation into the deaths
    of eight alleged members of the Bandidos Outlaw Motorcycle Gang.  The search warrants and the information used
    to obtain them were sealed from public view.  </p>

    Corporation (“the media”) applied for orders to quash or vary the judicial
    orders pursuant to which the warrant materials were sealed.  Four of the individuals who were originally
    charged with offences relating to the warrants intervened and requested that
    the media’s application be dismissed.  The Crown also opposed the application. </p>

    R.S.J.  In reasons dated January 29,
    2007, with supplementary reasons dated February 15, 2007, the application judge
    granted the media’s application to the extent of ordering that specified
    portions of the warrant materials be unsealed.  The application judge ordered that sealing orders should continue in
    force with respect to the remainder of the warrant materials. </p>

    judge’s order: one by Brett Gardiner and the other by the media.  On March 8, 2007, this court imposed a stay

    pending appeal.  </p>

    on charges of first degree murder in connection with the eight deaths.  He is the only one who appeals from the application
    judge’s order.  Gardiner contends that the
    application judge erred in releasing any portion of the search warrant
    materials.  His primary position is that
    the original sealing orders should be restored.  The media also appeal the application judge’s
    order.  The media take the contrary position

    basis for restoring the original sealing orders.  In disposing of the media’s appeal, I first
    find that the application judge’s reasons are not adequate to permit consideration
    and disposition of this appeal on its merits.  In the end, however, I propose to dismiss the
    media’s appeal because a judge of the Superior Court has now been assigned to the upcoming
    trial of the appellant Gardiner and his co-accused and he has since issued an
    order banning publication, broadcast and Internet posting of all pre-trial
    materials.  </p>

    the <i>Code</i> to make an order prohibiting
    access to and disclosure of any information relating to the warrant.  Subsections (1) and (2) of this provision

    impose terms or conditions on the order restricting access, including terms
    that speak to the duration of the order and terms that permit the partial
    disclosure of a document:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)
    Where an order is made under subsection (1), all documents relating to the

    the prohibition, partial disclosure of a document, deletion of any information
    or the occurrence of a condition, be placed in a packet and sealed by the
    justice or judge immediately on determination of the application, and that
    packet shall be kept in the custody of the court in a place to which the public

    it be dismissed.  In the alternative, the
    interveners asked that any order unsealing the warrants provide that there be
    no access until the completion of the proceedings.  The Crown similarly took the position that
    the application be dismissed without prejudice to the application being brought
    again after the conclusion of the trials of all accused.  The Crown in the alternative sought an order
    requiring that edited copies of the affidavits be made available to the public
    at the end of the trial of all accused.  In the further alternative, the Crown proposed that the affidavit
    material be unsealed for the purposes of permitting the Crown to edit the
    material (reviewable upon application to the court) and that the edited copy be
    publicly available on the condition that the content not be published until the
    completion of all trials.</p>

    provide the application judge with a specific rationalization as to why the
    various portions of the warrant materials should remain under seal.  The Crown did disclose an edited version of
    the sealed materials to defence counsel, but not in time to allow defence
    counsel the opportunity to review the disclosed materials prior to the hearing.
     The edited version was not made
    available to counsel for the media.  As a
    result, the parties advanced submissions about the legal principles to be
    applied on an application to quash or vary a sealing order, but they did not
    advance submissions about how those principles should be applied to the specific
    portions of the sealed warrant materials in issue. </p>

    [1998] S.C.J. No. 87, as providing support for the general proposition asserted

    information found in search warrant materials will necessarily prejudice an
    accused in a way that adversely affects the right to a fair trial.   The search warrant documents in <i>Flahiff</i> included information obtained
    from “a police informer and accomplice, who had agreed to cooperate with
    Canadian and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>

    hardly be doubted that a serious threat to the fairness of a trial would
    constitute a ‘sufficient reason’” within the meaning of s. 487.3(2)(b) of the <i>Code</i> so as to justify an order
    restricting access to search warrant materials.  He went on to say at p. 91 that trial fairness is not limited to a fair
    verdict, but also involves the fairness of the process in which the trial is
    conducted:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>No accused
    should have to face his trial in an ongoing torrent of unfair publicity.  No judge or jury should have to strain to
    banish unfair and unsupported publicity from their minds so that they can reach

    serenity of the atmosphere in which the trial is conducted.</p>

    information released by the application judge in this case.  Here, the disclosed information does not
    constitute incriminating evidence against the appellant Gardiner.  The descriptions of police observations of
    the crime scene and the condition of the victims do not serve to implicate
    Gardiner in any way in these deaths.  Furthermore, the nature of the descriptions cannot be said to be so
    graphic or shocking that potential jurors would be unduly affected thereby.  Nor, more generally, would pre-trial
    publication of the disclosed information place irreversible ideas in the minds
    of potential jurors that would prevent them from being impartial at the trial,
    or that would make it impossible for them to distinguish between evidence heard

    particularity the details relating to the grounds she relied on for sealing the
    specified portions of the warrant materials.  The second reason relates to the manner in which the parties proceeded
    on the <i>certiorari</i> application and on
    this appeal.  In both instances, the
    parties made no specific submissions about how the particular content of the voluminous
    search warrant materials can be said to engage the grounds relied on by the

    affairs.  They could not make specific
    submissions because they did not have access to even an edited version of the
    materials.  Counsel for the appellant
    Gardiner had an edited version, which was received on an undertaking not to
    publish or otherwise distribute its content.  However, he simply advanced the general argument – rejected above – that
    the public dissemination of any of the warrant materials would unduly prejudice
    the appellant’s right to a fair trial. </p>

    the Glover and Taylor warrant materials. We are able to speculate about what information
    the application judge may have concluded would compromise the identity of a
    confidential informant, or the nature and extent of an ongoing investigation, or
    endanger a person engaged in particular intelligence gathering techniques, or
    prejudice the privacy interests of an innocent person and/or the fair trial

    confidential informant referred to in s. 487.3(2)(a)(i), the Supreme Court of
    Canada has established that, aside from the innocence at stake exception,
    informer privilege is absolute: <i>Named
    Person v. Vancouver Sun</i>, 2007 SCC 43. Even so, judgment is required to
    identify what information might in fact compromise the identity of a confidential

    search warrant documents would compromise the extent of an ongoing
    investigation under s. 487.3(2)(a)(ii), the mere fact that there is an ongoing investigation
    will not automatically result in a sealing order. Doherty J.A. made this point
    and discussed some of the factors to be considered in assessing whether a
    sealing order is justified on that basis in <i>R.
    v. Toronto Star Newspapers</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 577 at para. 26, affirmed

    in s. 487.3(2)(a)(iii), which permits restricting access to information that
    would endanger persons engaged in particular intelligence gathering techniques.
     As Iacobucci J. said in <i>Mentuck </i>at p. 469,<i> </i>the court must consider the specificity of the information, the seriousness

    judgment is required in assessing the ground in s. 487.3(2)(a)(iv) of
    protecting the innocent.  The protection
    of the innocent does not always prevail over the public’s right to know.  In every case, all the pertinent rights and
    interests must be weighed and balanced, as Sharpe J.A. pointed out in <i>Episcopal Corp. of the Diocese of

    determining whether a sealing order is necessary to avoid prejudicing the fair
    trial rights of an accused.  The typical concern
    is that potential jurors will be tainted by exposure to publicly-disseminated
    information about the case.  This
    concern, where it legitimately exists, can usually be addressed by a
    publication ban rather than a sealing order.</p>

    submissions or particularized reasons of the application judge, it seems to us that
    there is much information that the application judge must have kept under seal solely
    on the basis of avoiding prejudice to fair trial rights.  The application judge indicated that she gave consideration
    to the alternative of a publication ban rather than a sealing order and went on
    to state without elaboration that a publication ban would be inadequate.  She suggested that, because some of the
    information in the Glover and Taylor warrants might not be admissible at trial,
    its disclosure might risk compromising the fair trial rights of the accused. </p>

    materials.  This court should not be
    called upon to exercise that judgment and discretion <i>de novo</i> on appeal without the benefit of reasons or
    submissions.  As I have observed, the
    manner in which this case proceeded calls for this court to perform an exercise

    (Ont. S.C.J.) per Nordheimer J.  That
    case also involved a <i>certiorari</i> application brought by various media organizations to set aside a sealing order
    that sealed from public view the information used to obtain multiple search
    warrants.  The different procedure the
    Crown used in that case enabled the court to deal with the matter efficiently

    warrant materials and redacted those portions about which it had specific
    concerns.  The Crown prepared a table
    setting out its position in an organized format.  The table contained three columns: the page
    numbers of the warrant material, the grounds for redacting any of those pages,
    and a description of the edited information.  The Crown consented to a preliminary order
    permitting it to provide the actual sealing order and the edited version of the
    information used to obtain the warrants to each of the media applicants.  The edited version and the table setting out
    the Crown’s position provided the basis for the submissions to the application
    judge.  To facilitate the judge’s review
    of the material, the Crown provided him with a copy of the warrant materials, with
    the edited portions identified by highlighter, thus eliminating the need to
    compare the edited version with the original. </p>

    the table provided by the Crown and includes an additional column indicating whether
    the application judge accepted or rejected the Crown’s proposed edits with a

    emphasize that the actions that led to the problems facing the parties and the
    application judge began with the sealing orders issued by the justices of the
    peace and the way those orders were understood and implemented by court
    staff.  The <i>Dagenais</i>/<i>Mentuck</i> standard, as codified in s. 487.3(1) of the <i>Code</i>,
    applies from the outset and should be kept in mind by the issuing justice when
    asked to impose a blanket sealing order on search warrant materials.  I recognize that it may not be feasible for
    the issuing justice to parse the materials paragraph-by-paragraph before
    fashioning the terms of a sealing order at the time the warrant is issued.
    However, court staff should not withhold material from the public that is
    beyond the ambit of the sealing order, as appears to have been the case with
    the Glover warrant.  In other words,
    court staff should not, as a matter of administrative practice, seal the terms
    of the sealing order itself, or seal information that is not subject to the
    terms of the order.</p>

    unseal warrant materials is commenced, some of the further problems encountered
    in this case can be avoided by the application judge taking firmer control of
    how the parties – primarily the Crown – proceed on the application.  For example, at the outset, the judge should
    require the Crown to identify the grounds upon which it opposes allowing access
    to the specific portions of the warrant materials.  The Crown should set out its position in an
    organized format, such as the table prepared by the Crown and incorporated in
    Nordheimer J.’s reasons in <i>Toronto Star</i>.  This document should be provided to the other
    parties to allow them to make effective submissions.  The Crown should provide an unedited copy of
    the warrant materials to the court, with the edited information identified by
    highlighting or otherwise, to clearly indicate what portions it seeks to have
    sealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preliminary orders may be required to decide what
    information is provided to the parties and on what terms they are to receive
    it.  In the present case, it would have
    been preferable if the application judge had decided not to proceed with the
    merits of the application after learning that the parties had not received the
    edited information in time to make submissions on it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Placing the onus on the Crown to perform the burdensome
    task just described reflects the presumption that once a search warrant has
    been executed, the warrant and the information upon which it is based must be
    made available to the public unless it is demonstrated that the ends of justice
    would be subverted by disclosure of the information.  The Crown, as the only party with access to
    all of the information, is in the best position to perform this task. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hearing must, of course, be tailored to the
    particular case.  However, regardless of
    how the hearing proceeds, requiring the Crown to set out the alleged grounds
    for a sealing order ensures that there will be in place a starting point for
    resolving the issues at hand.  This
    document will also prove helpful in dealing with procedural issues that might
    arise, including what material should be disclosed to other counsel to
    facilitate argument, on what basis such disclosure should be made, as well as
    whether some part of the hearing must proceed <i>in camera</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The document will also simplify the court’s obligation
    to give reasons for its conclusions.  In
    order to be susceptible to appellate review, the application judge’s reasons
    should indicate the specific basis upon which particular portions of the
    warrant materials are to be kept under seal.  This laborious task would be made much simpler
    if the court were able to indicate its disposition of each proposed redaction
    in an organized format such as that used by the court in <i>Toronto Star</i>.  The use of
    such a format will also help to alleviate the concern expressed by the application
    judge in this case that the rendering of reasons might have the effect of
    making the sealing order ineffective. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some cases, the application judge may find that it
    is not possible to adequately explain the reason for sealing information
    without providing an analysis that reveals sensitive information.  This concern does not, however, discharge the
    judge from the obligation of providing sufficiently detailed reasons so that
    his or her decision is comprehensible by the parties and susceptible of appellate
    review.  Where it is clear that the judge’s
    reasons would disclose information that she concludes should be sealed, the
    judge may prepare and release a redacted version of her reasons.  If the judge decides to take this course, it
    will be necessary to decide who will receive the unredacted version of the
    reasons, as well as when the unredacted reasons will become available to the
    public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of example, this court released redacted reasons
    in <i>R. v. E.W.M. </i>(2006), 223 C.C.C.
    (3d) 407.  In that case, the court’s
    release of its reasons would have “published” information subject to a
    publication ban issued at a bail hearing.  The complete reasons were immediately provided
    to the parties and were made available to the public at the end of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, I am of the view that the
    application judge’s reasons and the parties’ submissions are inadequate to
    enable us to effectively discharge the appellate review function.  This court is unable to discern the
    justification for the grounds relied on by the application judge to impose a
    partial sealing order.  We are thus
    unable to review her decision in a meaningful way: see <i>R. v Sheppard</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion would usually result in the appeal
    being allowed, the decision being set aside, and the matter being remitted for
    redetermination.  However, I would not
    allow the appeal but dismiss it.  Were
    this court to allow the media’s appeal because of the concerns identified about
    the inadequacy of the application judge’s reasons, this disposition would have
    two undesirable effects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, setting aside the application judge’s order would
    have the effect of reinstating the broader sealing orders imposed by the
    issuing justices.  Second, because we are
    not in a position to assess the merits of the partial sealing order imposed by
    the application judge, we would have to remit the matter to a judge of the
    Superior Court to hear the media’s application afresh.  Yet, as noted above, a judge of that court
    has now been assigned to the trial of the underlying charges and has issued an
    order banning publication of all pre-trial materials.  Were we to allow the appeal and remit the
    application, the result would be that another judge would be called upon to
    render a decision that could interfere with the assigned judge’s control of the
    trial proceeding. </p>

line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this court should therefore exercise its
    discretion to dismiss the media’s appeal, with leave to recommence the <i>certiorari</i> application before the judge
    assigned to the trial of the appellant Gardiner and the co-accused.</p>
