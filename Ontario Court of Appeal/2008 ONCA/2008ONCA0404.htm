    Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan (the “SUB Plan”) between Canadian
    General-Tower Limited (the “Employer”) and the United Steel Workers of America,
    Local 862 (the “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union”) provides for a supplemental weekly benefit for employees on “temporary
    layoff” from employment.  The supplemental unemployment benefit, when added
    to an employee’s regular employment insurance benefits, provides an employee
    with 80% of his or her weekly straight time pay (the “SUB Benefits”).  The
    SUB Plan is incorporated into the collective agreement between the parties
    (the “Collective Agreement”).  “Temporary lay-off” is not defined in either
    the SUB Plan or the Collective Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the elimination of an entire shift, the Employer gave notices
    of layoff to twenty-three unionized employees (the
    “Employees”).  The layoff notices were dated October 8, 2004; the layoffs
    were effective October 29, 2004.  No date of recall was specified in the
    notices and the Records of Employment issued to the Employees indicated that
    the terminations were deemed permanent because of a shortage of work.  The
    notices reminded the Employees to inform the Employer of any change in address
    or telephone number and to make themselves aware of their recall rights and
    obligations, while on layoff, under Article 5 of the Collective Agreement.  The
    notices also advised the Employees that they maintained their recall rights
    which, in accordance with Article 5, was either twelve or twenty-four months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 18, 2004, the Employer offered the Employees career transition workshops
    to assist them in finding other employment.  The offer was made on a voluntary
    basis and without reference to whether the layoffs were temporary or permanent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Employer recalled all the Employees in September and October of 2005, some
    49 weeks after the date of the layoffs.  Twenty-two of the twenty-three Employees
    elected to return to work.  The recalls were not due to the reinstatement
    of the shift and had been unexpected at the time of the layoffs.  They occurred
    because of unforeseen events, including medical leaves of absence, long term
    disability leaves, and voluntary and involuntary termination of employment
    of certain employees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Employer denied the Employees SUB Benefits on the basis that their layoffs
    were not “temporary layoffs” under the terms of the SUB Plan.  It viewed
    the layoffs as permanent because it had not expected to recall the Employees
    within the recall periods.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union grieved.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitrator
    Frank M. Reilly was appointed to consider the grievance.  The arbitration
    proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts.  The arbitrator reviewed
    the legislative provisions and case law relied on by the parties but found
    that neither assisted in determining the meaning of
    “temporary layoff” within the SUB Plan.  In particular, he dealt with the
    Employer’s submission that this court’s decision in <i>National Automobile
    Aerospace Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada (C.A.W.-Canada),
    Local No. 27 v. London Machinery Inc.</i> (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 444 establishes
    that a person is deemed terminated from employment after exhausting the period
    of thirty-five of fifty-two weeks, as set out in the <i>Employment Standards
    Act 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 41.  He rejected the submission that <i>London
    Machinery </i>determined the meaning of “temporary layoff” in the context
    of an SUB Plan and found the decision did not govern the situation before
    him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator was not swayed by the Employer’s argument that the layoff was
    permanent because when the Employees’ employment was terminated, there had
    been no expected return to work.  He accepted that when the notices had been
    given there had been no expectation that the Employees would return to work
    but explained that rights of recall are always subject to the vagaries of
    changing circumstances in the business world.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitrator
    Reilly concluded that the Employees were entitled to the SUB Benefits (the “Decision”).  In
    reaching this conclusion, he held that for the purpose of determining eligibility
    for such benefits, a “temporary layoff” was equivalent to the period that
    the Employees retained recall rights under the Collective Agreement.  As
    the Employees had been laid off in accordance with the provisions of the
    Collective Agreement and had been recalled in accordance with its terms,
    he viewed the Employees as having been on temporary layoff and entitled to
    the benefits of the SUB Plan.           </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Employer brought an application for judicial review, seeking to have the
    Decision quashed.  Justice Himel, writing on behalf of a unanimous
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, held that the interpretation of collective agreements – which
    includes SUB Plans - goes to the heart of the expertise of labour arbitrators
    and that arbitrators possess a superior expertise in such matters.  Based
    on the then-prevailing jurisprudence, she applied the “pragmatic and functional”
    approach to determining the standard of review and concluded that the appropriate
    standard was patent unreasonableness.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court did not find the Decision to be patently unreasonable and
    dismissed the application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court err in: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(1) applying a standard

    the Decision?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appeal was heard but before a decision was rendered, the Supreme Court
    of Canada released its decision in <i>Dunsmuir v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i>,<i> </i>2008 S.C.C. 9<i>.  </i>The parties were invited
    to make written submissions on the relevance of <i>Dunsmuir </i>to this appeal.  In
    those submissions, the parties are agreed that in <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the Supreme
    Court replaced the pragmatic and functional approach to the determination
    of the appropriate standard of review with a simpler analytical framework.  Further,
    they agree that there are now only two standards of review: correctness and
    reasonableness.  They disagree on which of the two standards should apply
    when the Decision is judicially reviewed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that patent unreasonableness is no longer an available standard of review
    and the parties disagree on the applicable standard of review, the first
    issue on appeal becomes what standard applies to the Decision.  Thereafter,
    it remains to be determined whether, on the applicable standard, the Decision
    should stand.          </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WHAT STANDARD OF REVIEW APPLIES

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the standard of review analysis prescribed by <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the court

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Employer argues that the standard established in the jurisprudence is that
    of correctness because Arbitrator Reilly was interpreting the <i>Employment
    Insurance Act </i>(the “Act”) and the <i>Employment Insurance Regulations </i>(the “Regulations”),
    a statutory regime over which the courts have greater expertise.  The
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union argues that the jurisprudence dictates that deference is to be shown
    to labour arbitrators who are interpreting a collective agreement.  That,
    the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union maintains, is what Arbitrator Reilly was called on to do in the present
    case.  Any references made by the arbitrator to the Act and the Regulations,
    it submits, were an attempt to assist in defining “temporary layoff” within
    the context of the Collective Agreement and not an interpretation of the
    legislative provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    exhaustive analysis is not required in every case to determine the proper
    standard of review: if the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory
    manner the degree of deference to be accorded a decision maker with regard
    to a particular category of question, the search for the appropriate standard
    is over.<a href="#_ftn1"

    of the task that Arbitrator Reilly was called on to perform in the present
    case.  Further, both the result and reasoning in <i>Dunsmuir </i>affirm a
    continuing stance of deference for decisions made by those in the field of
    labour relations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"

    was held to apply when reviewing the decision of an adjudicator made under
    the <i>Public Service Labour Relations Act</i>, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. P-25.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the standard of review analysis leads to the conclusion that the
    appropriate standard is that of reasonableness.  In <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para.50,
    the following factors were held as indicative that deference should be given
    and a reasonableness standard applied: (i) the existence of a privative clause;
    (ii) a discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision maker
    has specialised expertise; and (iii) the question of law is not of central
    importance to the legal system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As

    Divisional Court noted at para. 14 of its reasons, s. 48(1) of the <i>Labour

    clause which states that there will be “final and binding settlement by arbitration”.  Moreover,
    arbitrators possess special and superior expertise in interpreting collective
    agreements.<a

    the Collective Agreement is not one of central importance to the legal system

    Reilly had to decide the meaning of
    “temporary layoff”, an undefined phrase used in the SUB Plan.  As the SUB
    Plan had been incorporated into the Collective Agreement, the arbitrator
    was required to interpret a term of the Collective Agreement, an area in
    which labour arbitrators have a greater expertise than the courts.  For the
    reasons already given, I do not accept that Arbitrator Reilly interpreted
    legislation of </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>general application.  The
    SUB Plan is not governed and administered by the Act and Regulations.  It
    is an agreement negotiated between the Employer and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union and specifically incorporated into the Collective Agreement.  Entitlement
    to SUB Benefits is connected to employment insurance in the sense that as
    a condition of receiving the SUB Benefits, an employee must be in receipt
    of regular employment insurance benefits.  However, to the extent that the
    arbitrator considered the employment insurance legislation, he was simply
    looking for guidance when determining the meaning of “temporary layoff” within
    the Collective Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    Divisional Court correctly notes and explains, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I note that Arbitrator Reilly erred in his comments

    and not legally binding, may be reflective of legislative intent and are
    entitled to be considered as a relevant factor when interpreting legislation.  If
    the mistaken reference in the decision of the arbitrator was to be replaced
    by the word “Guidelines”, the statement is accurate. Holding that the Guidelines

    do I find that the arbitrator’s treatment of this court’s decision in <i>London
    Machinery </i>renders the Decision unreasonable.  The arbitrator saw <i>London
    Machinery </i>as a decision which addressed the rights of a unionized employee
    to the termination pay scheme under the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>.  Accordingly,
    he did not view it as determinative of the meaning of “temporary layoff” within
    the Collective Agreement.<i>  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Decision reflects due consideration of (1) the factual background to the
    layoffs as provided to him by the parties through the agreed statement of
    facts, (2) the terms of the SUB Plan and the Collective Agreement, and (3)
    the relevant law.  The arbitrator concluded, on the evidence before him,
    that the Employees were experiencing a temporary layoff within the meaning
    of the SUB Plan.  Recall rights were a significant factor in reaching that
    conclusion but they were not the only factor – the arbitrator did not simply
    equate recall rights with a temporary layoff.  The Decision is logical and
    can be rationally supported on the evidence before the arbitrator.  That
    is, it is reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    there is no basis for interfering with the Decision, I would dismiss the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent fixed at $15,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.  I would set the costs on a partial indemnity
    basis as I do not accept the respondent’s submission that an award on a substantial
    indemnity basis is warranted – the appellant was entitled to have the matter
    determined by the courts.  I would, however, set a higher amount than that
    sought on a partial indemnity basis at the time the appeal was heard because
    of the additional work required to prepare supplemental submissions on the
    effect of <i>Dunsmuir</i>.</p>
