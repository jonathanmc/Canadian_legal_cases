    a seventeen day jury trial, the appellant, Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI), was
    found liable for malicious prosecution and<b> </b>ordered to pay damages
    in the global amount of $2,078,120.27, including interest and costs to the
    respondents, Douglas and Terry McNeil. The action was dismissed against all
    the individual defendants.</p>

    appeals and seeks an order that the respondents’
    claim be dismissed, or in the alternative, that a new trial be ordered.  In
    the further alternative, BRI seeks to have the damages reduced.</p>

    order to appreciate the context of the legal issues raised, a review of the
    rather lengthy background to this case is essential.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    is the former employer of the respondent, Douglas McNeil (McNeil).  McNeil
    worked at the BRI store located at Lundy’s Lane in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls.  In the summer of 1993, the Lundy’s Lane store records indicated
    ongoing shortages of cash and inventory.  As a result, from October 31, 1993
    to November 22, 1993, BRI had covert surveillance cameras installed in the
    store above the cash registers and manager’s desk to monitor the conduct
    of employees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    management reviewed the tapes and developed the view that various practices
    by certain employees were the cause of the store losses.  In respect of McNeil,
    the evidence from the tapes revealed the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)        November 3, 1993: At 16:32, McNeil is
    shown removing $140US from the till, which is placed into his wallet (the “first
    inculpatory segment” of the tape).  Approximately forty minutes later, McNeil
    exchanges the $140US with a customer in return for the Canadian equivalent.  McNeil
    then pays the Canadian equivalent back into the till (the “second exculpatory
    segment” of the tape);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)        November 16, 1993: At 15:06, McNeil is
    shown taking $22.00 from his pocket and putting that money into the till
    (the “first exculpatory segment” of the tape).  At 15:37, McNeil’s co-worker,
    Tony Vacca, is shown making a sale of a Northern Brewery sweatshirt in the
    approximate amount of $24.99.  At 15:41, McNeil is observed reversing the
    sale of the sweatshirt and removing two tens and two loonies from the till
    which is then split with Vacca (the “second inculpatory segment” of the tape). </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Criminal Proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 29, 1993, Stephen MacFarlane, Assistant Manager in the Hamilton
    Region, prepared a witness statement describing the alleged criminal activities
    captured by the surveillance tapes.  However, the statement only referred
    to the specific, inculpatory segments on the videotape and omitted reference
    to the exculpatory segments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 30, 1993, certain members of BRI management held a meeting in which
    the surveillance tapes were reviewed.  Paul Murray, BRI’s operations manager
    for the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton region, stated that there was insufficient evidence from the tapes
    to terminate any of the employees.  Other BRI management expressed the view
    that there was insufficient evidence of theft of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    currency.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that BRI management reviewed and was aware of <i>both</i> the
    inculpatory and exculpatory segments of the tape in order to reach these
    conclusions.  In fact, a summary of the tapes developed by BRI in late November
    1993 demonstrates clearly that, from the outset, BRI had full knowledge of
    the exculpatory segments of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    currency transaction.  According to the summary, McNeil sold the $140US and
    paid the Canadian equivalent back into the till.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Murray conceded at trial that no one would have charged McNeil for this theft
    after viewing the entirety of the tape and seeing the exculpatory evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    this apparent knowledge, on November 30, 1993, BRI proceeded to hand the
    tapes over to the police.  In doing so, BRI failed to draw to the attention
    of the police the exculpatory segments of the videotapes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving MacFarlane’s statement and the tapes, the officer in charge of
    the investigation, Detective Kane, concluded that a number of BRI employees
    had participated in criminal activities.  On December 4, 1993, six employees
    were arrested and charged.  The arrests included McNeil.  Four of the employees
    pleaded guilty to the criminal charges.  Charges against one employee were
    withdrawn.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only information Detective Kane had in support of his decision to lay charges
    emanated from BRI.  Kane relied heavily on BRI and its security company to
    operate the videotapes in the course of the investigation since special equipment
    and expertise were required and it had to be played by someone familiar with
    it to retrieve the relevant passages.  In the course of this review, Kane
    was never told about, nor was he shown the exculpatory segments of the videotapes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the arrests, BRI management notified McNeil and the other charged employees
    of their suspension without pay.  The targeted employees also became the
    subject of media attention.  Newspaper articles, one of which specifically
    named each employee arrested, reported that they were involved in a “fraudulent” scheme.  Local
    radio and television evening news reported McNeil’s arrest and the charges
    against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 1994, prior to McNeil’s criminal trial, a memorandum was exchanged
    between members of BRI management expressing concern about the information
    that was provided to the police in relation to the criminal investigation
    and calling for an “internal review” of that information.  The memo also
    addressed the possibility of bringing the charged employees back to work,
    but acknowledged that “full reinstatement would cause long lasting damage
    to [BRI’s] credibility”.  Instead, a solution was offered to use the criminal
    charges “as a lever to obtain some kind of non-grievable admission of guilt”,
    in which a “schedule of discipline” could be administered for each involved
    employee.  The discipline recommended for McNeil was termination.  The results
    of this recommended “internal review” were never produced.  In fact, it is
    unclear whether such a review even occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McNeil’s
    criminal trial commenced in December 1994.  In respect of the charge relating
    to theft of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    money, McNeil explained that the removal of $140US was part of a sale of
    US cash for a family friend.  McNeil maintained that the second segment of
    the tape corroborated this explanation, indicating that he paid the Canadian
    money into the till in return for the sale.  However, at trial, only the
    first inculpatory segment showing McNeil removing
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    currency from the till was shown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the Northern Brewery sweatshirt incident, McNeil explained at
    trial that the tape depicting him removing money from the till was unrelated
    to the sweatshirt sale.  He stated that $22.00 had been put into the till
    to make change for a football pool with his co-worker, Vacca.  McNeil and
    Vacca habitually each bought a card to play in a weekly football pool.  Each
    card cost $11.00.  McNeil and Vacca took turns paying the $22.00 for the
    two cards on alternate weeks.<b>  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the date in question, Vacca expressed uncertainty about whether he wanted
    to bet that week.  This explanation is supported by the first exculpatory
    part of the surveillance tape, which shows McNeil putting a $20.00 bill and
    a $2.00 bill into the till.  McNeil explained that he did this in order to
    make change for two tens and two loonies for the two $11.00 bets.  He did
    not take the change immediately because of Vacca’s indecision.  This first
    exculpatory part of the tape was not shown at the criminal trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second, inculpatory part of the surveillance tape that was shown demonstrates
    that, later in the day, Vacca sold a Northern Brewery sweatshirt in the approximate
    amount of $24.99.  McNeil explained that Vacca had entered the wrong size
    for the sweatshirt and asked him to assist in correcting the error.  He stated
    that when they got to the till to correct the error, Vacca decided that he
    did not want to bet in the pool that week and McNeil removed two tens and
    two loonies (the $22.00) from the till to give Vacca his $11.00 back and
    to get the change for his own $11.00 bet.  In doing so, while he reversed
    the sale of the sweatshirt, he forgot to enter the revised sale.  He argued
    that his explanation was substantiated by the low and unusual amount removed,
    that did not match the alleged theft of the $24.99 sweatshirt sale and that
    would also have created an overage in the register and a record of missing
    inventory.    <b> </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the first day of trial, McNeil and his counsel, together with
    the Crown, viewed the tape and attempted to find the exculpatory evidence
    that supported McNeil’s explanation.  No assistance in operating the tapes
    was offered by BRI management who retained the expertise and familiarity
    needed to retrieve the relevant passages.  The parties failed to recover
    the exonerating passages.  McNeil was subsequently convicted of theft of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    money ($140US) and theft of the shared proceeds of the sale of the Northern
    Brewery sweatshirt (approximately $11.00), and acquitted of two other charges.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Arbitration</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    convictions were swiftly followed by McNeil’s termination from BRI on December
    13, 1994.  McNeil grieved his dismissal pursuant to the collective agreement.  The
    grievance did not reach arbitration until 1997.  Throughout this period,
    BRI management maintained their original position in respect of McNeil and
    failed to draw any attention to the exculpatory portions of the videotape
    that they were aware of and that corroborated McNeil’s explanation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator rejected McNeil’s evidence and upheld the discharge on the basis
    that McNeil and Vacca had falsely indicated a refund for the return of a
    sweatshirt, thus creating an “overage” in the cash register, and then McNeil
    split the proceeds with Vacca.  The issue relating to the theft of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    money was not asserted as a ground for discharge at the arbitration. However,
    inasmuch as the arbitrator’s decision rested on McNeil’s credibility, McNeil’s
    criminal conviction for theft was highly damaging evidence at the arbitration. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal and Subsequent Proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of the

    money exculpatory segment emerged during the grievance procedure when the
    original tapes were provided to the union.  When its existence came to light,
    McNeil successfully sought an extension of time to appeal his convictions.
    On May 6, 1997, McNeil’s convictions were quashed.  The appeal judge cited
    the absence of the second portion of the tape at trial, which was consistent
    with the explanation provided by McNeil respecting the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    money incident, as the basis for his decision.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McNeil
    commenced a civil action for malicious prosecution in 1999. As part of that
    action, his wife, Terry McNeil, claimed damages pursuant to the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, for loss of her husband’s care, guidance,
    and companionship.  The trial took place in 2006.  McNeil alleged that BRI,
    having brought the matter to the attention of police, intentionally failed
    to disclose the exculpatory evidence with respect to the criminal charge
    relating to the removal of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>

    the

  <h3><i>Jurisdiction </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    pleaded want of jurisdiction in its statement of defence to the action for
    malicious prosecution.  However, during the seven years leading up to trial
    and during the trial itself, BRI never moved to dismiss the action on jurisdictional
    grounds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    now disputes the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the respondents’ malicious
    prosecution action on the basis that the essential character of their claim
    arises in the context of employment and is governed by the collective agreement.  Relying
    on the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Weber v. Ontario Hydro</i>, [1995]
    2 S.C.R. 929 at para. 54, BRI argues that a labour arbitration tribunal has
    exclusive jurisdiction over all differences between an employer and employee
    that “expressly or inferentially arise out of the collective agreement”.  BRI
    submits that, as exclusive jurisdiction lies with the labour arbitrator,
    it can argue, after the fact, that the court acted without jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this submission for two reasons.  First, this is not a matter where
    the court acted without jurisdiction.  The court has plenary jurisdiction
    over actions in tort. This tort action proceeded to judgment without the
    court’s jurisdiction being displaced by the invocation of the <i>Weber</i> principle.  The
    judgment rendered by the court is not a nullity based on an excess of jurisdiction <i>ab
    initio</i>. After having defended and lost the action, BRI cannot now vitiate
    the result by seeking to displace the court’s plenary jurisdiction in tort
    matters.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    BRI’s belated argument that <i>Weber </i>applies is without merit.  This
    view is supported by the decision in <i>Piko v. Hudson's Bay Co.</i> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 729 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), </span>in which this court decided that the employee's malicious prosecution
    action against his employer fell outside the scope of the collective bargaining
    regime.  Perhaps BRI proceeded to trial without objecting to the court’s
    jurisdiction because it was aware of the <i>Piko</i> decision; in any event,
    BRI now seeks to distinguish <i>Piko</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    says <i>Piko</i> is a different case because the BRI collective agreement,
    unlike that in <i>Piko</i>, contains a clause that requires the employer
    to treat its employees fairly.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In <i>Piko, </i>Laskin J.A. did acknowledge that
    the collective agreement in <i>Weber</i> had such a clause whereas the agreement
    in <i>Piko</i> did not (pp. 735-36).  However we do not regard that observation
    as necessary to his ultimate determination.  The crux of Laskin J.A.’s reasoning
    that the court retained jurisdiction over the action was that the employer
    itself had gone outside the collective bargaining regime when it resorted
    to the criminal process.  The action by the employer was neither a prerequisite
    to nor a necessary consequence of its dismissal of the employee.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    a dispute must be arbitrated depends on whether
    “its essential character, arises from the interpretation, application, administration
    or violation of the collective agreement”: <i>Weber </i>at para. 52.  The
    employer’s act in initiating criminal proceedings may well raise fairness
    concerns that touch on the employer’s treatment of the employee in the employment
    relationship.  However, it is the “essential character” of the dispute that
    matters.  As Laskin J.A. said in <i>Piko</i>, once the employer takes its
    dispute with the employee to the criminal courts, it is no longer just a
    labour relations dispute (p. 735).  It is not enough that the subject matter
    of the criminal process and malicious prosecution action could conceivably
    be relevant in a workplace dispute.  In our view, this is not a dispute which
    in its “essential character” arises from the fairness of the employer’s application
    or administration of the collective agreement.  Rather, this dispute, as
    in <i>Piko</i>, is centered on the employer’s resort to the criminal process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    goes on to advance a more focused jurisdictional argument.  It argues that
    at least McNeil's claim for lost wages arises from the collective agreement
    and falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labour arbitrator.  BRI
    points out that the arbitrator dismissed McNeil’s termination grievance,
    thus implicitly deciding that he had no entitlement to lost wages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first glance the argument is alluring.  The employee’s entitlement to wages
    lies at the heart of the employment relationship.  However, on reflection,
    we think that once it is decided that the essential character of the dispute
    is the tort of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff is entitled to claim
    the full range of damages available in that action.  The “essential character”
    analysis must be applied to the dispute as a whole and not to its constituent
    elements.  Human rights cases, for example, routinely relate to occurrences
    in the workplace and involve claims for lost wages.  However, once it has
    been decided that a human rights proceeding has a separate essential character,
    it may proceed even with a claim for lost wages.  See <i>Ford Motor Co. of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, we observe that the tort of malicious prosecution does not provide
    the remedy of lost wages to which the employee was entitled under the collective
    agreement.  It provides the remedy of damages, and the quantum of “lost wages” is
    relevant to the quantification of damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    conclude that BRI may not raise the <i>Weber </i>principle to oust the court’s
    jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.  In any event, because of the
    principles expressed by this court in <i>Piko</i>,<i> </i>BRI’s objection
    is without merit. </p>
  <h3><i>The trial judge’s decision to exclude the arbitrator’s award and references
      to the arbitration</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, BRI sought to introduce the arbitrator’s ruling and to make references
    to the arbitration as a consideration for the jury in making its own finding
    of fact.  The trial judge refused to admit such evidence, ruling that the
    arbitration was not relevant, as the issue of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    money was not before the arbitrator, and that, in any event, the evidence
    was inadmissible as its prejudicial effect outweighed any possible probative
    value that might arise from its admission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  We
    agree. The ruling could not have been introduced into evidence before the
    jury without first going through a detailed discussion of what issues and
    evidence were before the arbitrator so that the basis for the ruling could
    be understood.  There was no transcript of that hearing.  The risk of the
    jury being sidetracked and getting bogged down in the minutia of that hearing

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    focus of BRI’s argument is on initiation. The trial judge’s charge to the
    jury<b> </b>on the requirement of initiation was as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first question of fact for you to determine
    is whether the plaintiff has proven that the criminal proceedings against
    Doug McNeil were initiated by one or more of the defendants.  The plaintiff
    must prove that the defendant or defendants were the persons who set the
    criminal proceedings in motion against the plaintiff or the person or persons
    who aided or encouraged the prosecution as its real instigator.  It is not
    necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant or defendants actually
    laid the information, as long as you are satisfied on the preponderance of
    evidence that the defendant or defendants were the ones who were actively
    instrumental in setting the criminal proceedings in motion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find that the defendant or defendants fairly
    and truthfully disclosed to the police or to the Crown Attorney all matters
    within their knowledge that a reasonably prudent person would believe material
    to the question of the plaintiff’s guilt or innocence and that the determination
    to prosecute was made by the police or the Crown Attorney or some other responsible
    person, then the defendant or defendants are not responsible for that prosecution.  If,
    however, you find that the defendant or defendants directed or interfered
    with the prosecution or insisted that the Crown Attorney or police prosecute,
    then you would find the defendant or defendants responsible for the prosecution.  If
    the defendant or defendants knowingly provided the police with false information
    with the intention that the police would take action, this does not necessarily
    amount to setting the law in motion as to make the defendant or defendants
    responsible.  You must consider the nature of the allegations, the circumstances
    in which they were made, and the effect it had on the eventual prosecution.  In
    other words, you must determine whether the defendants by providing the false
    information were actively involved and instrumental to the prosecution.  If
    you find that none of the defendants are responsible for initiating the prosecution,
    your verdict will be for the defendant and you will proceed no further.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI
    made no objection to the trial judge’s charge on initiation perhaps because
    the instructions provided were favourable to the defence.  The charge left
    the jury with the impression that a finding of initiation required them to
    accept the respondents’ position that the defendant instigated the prosecution
    by supplying false evidence in circumstances where the police had to wholly
    rely on it and did rely on it.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BRI’s
    principle submission on this issue is that initiation and malice are separate
    watertight compartments and that, in deciding whether a person has initiated
    a prosecution, no qualitative assessment may be undertaken as to whether
    a person has provided false information or deliberately withheld information
    from the police.  No authorities were submitted by BRI to support this submission
    and in fact, the jurisprudence suggests a contrary view.  The relationship
    between falsely and maliciously providing information and initiation of a
    prosecution was described in the House of Lords decision of <i>Martin v.
    Watson </i>[1996] A.C. 74 at 86:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Where an individual falsely and maliciously
      gives a police officer information indicating that some person is guilty
      of a criminal offence and states that he is willing to give evidence in
      court of the matters in question, it is properly to be inferred that he
      desires and intends that the person he names should be prosecuted.</span> Where
      the circumstances are such that the facts relating to the alleged offence
      can be within the knowledge only of the complainant, as was the position
      here, then it becomes virtually impossible for the police officer to exercise
      any independent judgment, and if a prosecution is instituted by the police
      officer the proper view of the matter is that the prosecution has been
      procured by the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This

    (S.C.J.); <i>Wood v. Kennedy </i>(1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 542 at para. 50

    information provided or the misconduct of the individual providing that information
    should not be considered at the initiation stage must be rejected.  </p>

    further suggests that a private party who goes to the police with a criminal
    allegation initiates the prosecution <i>only</i> if it is “virtually impossible” for
    the police to independently exercise discretion or judgment as to whether
    to lay an information.  BRI submits that this test has not been satisfied
    because it gave the entire tape containing the exculpatory evidence to the
    police and Detective Kane confirmed that an independent evaluation was conducted
    prior to laying charges.    </p>

    contrast, the respondents argue that the law recognizes that there may be
    a variety of ways to satisfy the initiation requirement, apart from simply
    the “virtual impossibility” test.  Reliance is placed on the decision in <i>Martin
    v. Watson</i>, which accepted the view that a person may be regarded as the
    prosecutor or the individual who initiated the action if “he puts the police
    in possession of information which virtually compels an officer to lay an
    information; if he deliberately deceives the police by supplying false information
    in the absence of which the police would not have proceeded; or if he withholds
    information in the knowledge of which the police would not prosecute.” <i> Martin

    our view, this is not a case in which we must decide all the factors that
    could, in any particular case, satisfy the element of initiation.  On the
    facts of this case, it was open to the jury to find that BRI knowingly withheld
    exculpatory information from the police which the police could not be expected
    to find and indeed did not find upon their review of the tapes.  But for
    the withholding of this essential information, McNeil would not have been
    charged.</p>

    facts here confirm that the police and the Crown relied wholly on BRI, which
    actively and deliberately misled them.  Only a trained operator of the video

    their own due diligence, to uncover the exculpatory evidence available to
    BRI prior to laying charges.  </p>

    a result, the police did not have all the information available to BRI prior

    the exculpatory evidence and Detective Kane’s evidence that he was never
    told about the exculpatory evidence until after the criminal trial is strong
    evidence that BRI deliberately withheld information when it went to the police.  </p>

    Kane did not conduct an independent investigation. Kane claimed that he used
    MacFarlane’s witness statement as the basis for his report, only to be confronted
    with the fact that he used it verbatim.  Furthermore, there was evidence
    from which the jury could find that it was virtually impossible for Kane
    to perform an independent investigation before laying charges.   Perhaps
    the best evidence is the fact that neither he, nor McNeil’s counsel, nor
    McNeil himself could locate the exculpatory portion of the alleged

    aggravated damages.  In addition, the jury awarded punitive damages against
    BRI in the amount of $500,000. Other aspects of the award included pecuniary
    damages in the amount of $240,000 for future loss of income, and special
    damages in the amount of $308,000 for past loss of income and legal expenses.
    Finally, the jury awarded <i>Family Law Act</i> damages to Terry McNeil in
    the amount of $50,000. </p>
  <h3>(1)       Past and Future Loss of Income</h3>

      oral argument, BRI did not take issue with the amount of damages awarded
      under these heads; rather, it contended that the court had no jurisdiction
      to award them. We have already addressed and rejected that argument in
      our reasons dealing with jurisdiction. Nothing more need be said about
      it. </span></p>
  <h3>(2)       <i>Family Law Act </i>Award to Terry McNeil</h3>

      award of $50,000 to Terry McNeil for loss of care, guidance and companionship
      may be generous but in our view, it does not warrant appellate intervention. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mrs.
      McNeil saw her husband transferred from a “happy-go-lucky” companion into
      a man who was “eaten up inside” and who felt that he must hide his feelings
      from her. The conduct of BRI exposed Mrs. McNeil to her husband’s anguish,
      pain, grief and altered persona for a period of thirteen years. While it
      is true that the ordeal ultimately strengthened their marriage, it is equally
      true that Mrs. McNeil was deprived of her husband’s care, guidance and
      companionship for a considerable period of time. In the circumstances,
      the award was one that the jury could make and we see no basis for interfering
      with it.   </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BRI’s
      overriding complaint is that the global award of $788,000 for the three
      heads of damages is so inordinately high that it warrants appellate intervention. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      particular, BRI maintains that the total sum of $288,000 awarded for general
      and aggravated damages was sufficient to compensate McNeil.  BRI argues
      that amount adequately reflects the principles of denunciation and general
      and specific deterrence needed to teach BRI and others that the improper
      initiation and use of the criminal process against employees is unacceptable
      and will attract severe penalties when proved.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      would not give effect to BRI’s submission. The aggravated and punitive
      damages awarded by the jury reflect the jury’s sense of outrage at BRI’s
      conduct and the enormity of the harm it concluded McNeil had suffered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
      its verdict, it is apparent that the jury viewed BRI as a calculating and
      insensitive company that was prepared, for its own purposes, to see an
      innocent man convicted of a crime it knew he did not commit.  As counsel
      for the respondents points out, the duplicity and deception practiced by
      BRI was not limited to a one-time act of folly that occasioned limited
      harm; rather, BRI carried on the charade for the better part of thirteen
      years. Notably, as late as 1995, BRI continued its duplicity at the arbitration
      hearing and in the process, robbed McNeil of his reputation, his employment,
      his dignity and his self&#8209;respect. Shocked and devastated by his arrest,
      proclaimed publicly as a common thief, terminated from his employment,
      forced to go on unemployment insurance, forced to sell the family home
      and move to an apartment, forced to endure the anguish, stress and uncertainty
      of a thirteen-year ordeal – these are but some of the consequences McNeil
      was exposed to by reason of BRI’s callous and malicious conduct.</span></p>

      from that perspective, as we must in light of the jury’s verdict, we see
      no basis for interfering with the quantum of damages or the heads under
      which they were awarded. In this regard, we are guided by the principles
      enunciated in <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>, [1995] 2
      S.C.R. 1130, and the circumstances giving rise to the award of general,

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Cross-appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents seek an order increasing the amount awarded for substantial indemnity
    fees from $225,000 to $293,226 in order to reflect the hours allowed by the
    trial judge but at the hourly rates of respondents’ counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents claimed $519,520.04 for substantial indemnity fees, comprised
    of a $200,000 premium and $319,520.04 based upon hourly rates of counsel,
    students and law clerks.  The trial judge held that no premium was payable
    by the appellants.  The trial judge then found that the substantial indemnity
    fees claimed by the respondents should be reduced by assessing all substantial
    indemnity rates at 1.5 times the allowed partial indemnity rates.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that the full rates claimed are fair and ought to be awarded
    in light of the complexity of the matter which demanded the time, experience
    and expertise of the counsel involved.  They argue that trial judge’s reduction
    of the substantial indemnity rates to 1.5 times the partial indemnity rates
    does not reflect the list of factors under rule 57.01, which allow the court,
    in exercising its discretion to award costs, to account for the principle
    of indemnity, including the experience of the lawyer involved, the rates
    charged and the hours spent by that lawyer.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    costs of a proceeding are within the discretion of the court: <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 131(1).  An award should not be
    set aside unless the trial judge made an error in principle, the award is
    plainly wrong, or the trial judge considered irrelevant factors or reached
    an unreasonable conclusion:  <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at para. 27.  None of those factors exist here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the award of costs is consistent with the specific rates and definition
    of substantial indemnity costs set out in the rules, which provide that substantial
    indemnity costs means costs awarded in an amount that is 1.5 times the partial
    indemnity rates: <i> Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194,
    rule 1.03(1).   Substantial indemnity costs are not the same as what a party
    pays or may agree to pay to a lawyer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge recognized that she had the discretion to award costs representing
    full indemnity, but concluded that it was not appropriate.  In exercising
    this discretion, the trial judge accounted for the defendants’ objections
    to the bill of costs, including that they defended the action in good faith
    and were justified in pursuing a defence in these circumstances; that the
    hourly rates claimed are excessive and fail to comply with the rates established
    by the rules; and that the number of hours claimed is unreasonable in all
    of the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also accounted for the relevant factors set out in rule 57.01.  She
    determined that there was “no reason to depart from the definition of substantial
    indemnity costs as set out in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.”  She
    also noted that certain conduct on behalf of the respondents’ counsel had
    unnecessarily lengthened the trial, including the continuance of a claim
    against a named defendant even after the respondents had conceded that the
    defendant was not liable in the action and the adjournment at the outset
    of the trial because the respondents attended without the proper video equipment.  Overall,
    the trial judge’s costs award constitutes a fair and reasonable assessment
    within the reasonable expectations of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
