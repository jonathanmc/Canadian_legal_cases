  <h4>The Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is an appeal by the insurer (defendant) from a jury verdict and a cross-appeal
    by the insured (plaintiff).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insurer’s
    counsel alleges that plaintiff’s counsel at trial made numerous improper
    comments in the course of his closing address to the jury.  Counsel submits
    that the trial judge should have discharged the jury in light of these comments,
    or expressly drew to the jury’s attention the improper comments, and told
    the jury to disregard those comments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his discussion with counsel, the trial judge indicated that there were certain
    improper comments made by counsel, but he did not identify those comments.  In
    his instructions, the trial judge chose not to expressly address the alleged
    improprieties in counsel’s address.  The trial judge made it clear to the
    jury, however, that it must take all legal instructions exclusively from
    him and that the jury must base their factual findings on their own recollections
    of the evidence and not the recollections of counsel or the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    find it unnecessary to address individually the propriety of the many statements
    made by plaintiff’s counsel in his closing address that counsel for the insurer
    contends were improper.  Assuming without deciding that plaintiff’s counsel
    did on occasion misstate the evidence and invite the jury to apply an improper
    test for the plaintiff’s entitlement to disability benefits, we are satisfied
    that these comments could not have prejudiced the insurer at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury had to decide two issues in this case:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Was
    the plaintiff entitled to disability benefits under the policy?</li>
    <li> Was
      the plaintiff entitled to punitive damages?  </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury decided that the plaintiff was entitled to the disability benefits and
    they decided the question of punitive damages against the plaintiff and in
    favour of the insurer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the meaning of disability under
    the policy.  He specifically told the jury to ignore anything counsel had
    said about the law applicable to the interpretation of the policy.  No objection
    was made to the trial judge’s instructions in this regard by counsel for
    the insurer.  After some deliberation, the jury returned with a question
    that suggests that the jury had honed in on the crucial question to be determined
    on the disability issue.  The jury’s question does not suggest any confusion
    in the jury’s mind, but rather indicates to us  that they had fixed on the
    proper issue.  The trial judge heard submissions from counsel and repeated
    his initial instructions on the meaning of disability under the policy.  Once
    again, no objection was taken to these instructions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the trial judge’s instructions, it is beyond doubt that the jury decided
    the question of disability on a proper instruction as to the applicable legal
    principles.  The instruction on entitlement was accurate, complete and even-handed.  In
    our view, the issue was a straightforward one both factually and legally.  We
    are not convinced that anything counsel might have said that shaded the evidence
    or suggested a different test for disability could possibly have affected
    the jury’s consideration.  We note that most of the alleged improper comments
    by counsel occurred in the part of his jury address in which he was dealing
    with the issue of punitive damages.  Clearly, those comments, assuming they
    were improper, did not in any way prejudice the insurer as the jury found
    against punitive damages in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the course of oral argument, counsel for the insurer submitted that the verdict
    was perverse in that no reasonable jury could have found in the plaintiff’s
    favour on the question of disability.  As we understand it, counsel made
    this argument not as a stand alone ground of appeal but to demonstrate that
    the allegedly improper comments by counsel for the plaintiff must have misled
    and confused the jury and resulted in a verdict that could not be supported
    on any reasonable view of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree with the premise of this submission.  There was ample evidence from
    the plaintiff, his experts and, to some extent, from the insurer’s experts
    to give substance to the appellant’s disability claim.  No doubt, there was
    also evidence that supported the insurer’s position on this issue.  It was
    for the jury to assess the competing positions and the evidence relied on
    by the parties in support of their position.  Nothing in the result reached
    by the jury suggests that they were improperly influenced by anything counsel
    said.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4>The Cross-Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the cross-appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial judge erred in:  (1)
    his charge to the jury in respect of punitive damages; (2) his calculation
    of prejudgment interest;  (3) using the language suggested by the insurer
    in the formal judgment; and (4) the costs awards.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge erred in any of these respects and we did
    not call on the insurer to respond to the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no error in the charge to the jury in respect of punitive damages.  It
    was consistent with the now well established legal principles.  On the totality
    of the evidence, the plaintiff did not have a strong case for punitive damages.  It
    was open to the jury to refuse to award such damages on this record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar
    as prejudgment interest is concerned, the plaintiff argues that the trial
    judge was bound to apply the presumptive 6 percent rate of prejudgment interest.  We
    disagree.  The order made by the trial judge reflects the fact that the amounts
    owing to the plaintiff were payable on a periodic basis and that the interest
    rates fluctuated during that period.  There is no basis to interfere with
    the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    to the form of judgment, the plaintiff submits that the approved form would
    prevent him from pursuing a claim for disability benefits beyond November
    21, 2006, the date referred to in the judgment.  We do not read the judgment
    that way.  Claims referable to the period beyond November 21, 2006 will have
    to be determined on their own merits, if and when they arise.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar
    as the cross-appeal relates to the question of costs, we begin by noting
    that the plaintiff did not seek leave to appeal costs.  There is no basis
    upon which leave should be granted.  In any event, we see no error in the
    trial judge’s exercise of his discretion.  He was fully justified in deciding
    the various issues relating to costs in the light of the atmosphere that
    existed between counsel and their very adversarial conduct throughout the
    trial.  This includes the trial judge’s determination that the plaintiff’s
    rule 49 offer was uncertain because it failed to directly and expressly advert
    to the claim for declaratory relief. </p>
