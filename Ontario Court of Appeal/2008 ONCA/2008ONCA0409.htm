'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a trial before Wilson J., the appellant was acquitted of sexual assault but
    convicted of assault and uttering a threat. The complainant in each of the
    charges was the appellant’s wife. The charges were laid in November 2004,
    shortly after the parties separated, and arose from events that allegedly
    occurred prior to their separation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on his appeal against the convictions. In his
    first ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    by relying on a letter dated November 7, 2005 from the complainant’s lawyer
    in matrimonial proceedings to the appellant’s lawyer in the matrimonial proceedings
    as confirming a history of violence in the marriage. For reasons that I will
    explain, I would allow the appeal on this ground. It is therefore unnecessary
    that I deal with the remaining grounds of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant came to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Iran</st1:country-region>
    at the age of fifteen and eventually established himself as a real estate
    agent. In 2000, he visited
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iran</st1:country-region>
    and married the complainant, who moved with him to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . According to the complainant, the appellant was a domineering and abusive
    spouse. Amongst other concerns, the complainant said she was unable to go
    out without the appellant’s permission, was not allowed to have friends,
    and had no independent access to money. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant also alleged that the appellant abused her physically. She claimed
    that during one incident, he ripped off a dress she was wearing, threw her
    to the ground, grabbed her by the hair, punched her and hit her with his
    slippers. In relation to another incident, the complainant said the appellant
    punched, kicked, slapped, and choked her, and warned her,
    “Don’t do something that tonight will be the last night of your life.” The
    complainant also alleged that the appellant forced her to have anal intercourse
    against her will.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2005, the complainant, the appellant, and their lawyers attended
    a four-way meeting in an effort to settle an outstanding spousal support
    application commenced by the complainant in January 2005. Following that
    meeting, the complainant’s lawyer sent the November 7, 2005 letter to the
    appellant’s lawyer. The letter stated that the complainant was
    “willing to make one very last chance at marital reconciliation.” However,
    the letter also said, “in light of the acrimonious and violent past between
    her and her husband, she is not prepared to even consider this possibility,
    without certain safeguards.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    of the terms proposed in the November 7, 2005 letter were that the appellant
    purchase a condominium and a car for the complainant, to be registered in
    the complainant’s name. The letter also indicated that as part of the proposal,
    the parties would engage in mediation and that the complainant would “abandon
    or withdraw her claim for spousal support, and all legal actions she is currently
    maintaining against [the appellant] in court.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of the defence position at trial was that the complainant’s evidence
    was not worthy of belief because of the lack of any physical evidence to
    support her allegations and because of lies and inconsistencies in her evidence.
    Defence counsel at trial submitted that the complainant lied when she claimed
    that a third party present at the four-way meeting suggested that the appellant
    might buy her a house and a car if she went back and lived with the appellant,
    and when she said she had not actually seen the November 7, 2005 letter prior
    to trial. Defence counsel claimed that the letter was an attempt at extortion,
    and that the complainant lied to distance herself from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Trial Judge’s Reasons </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence and rejected the appellant’s
    evidence. However, as she had a reasonable doubt concerning whether the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i> for sexual assault had been proven, the trial judge acquitted the
    appellant of that charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Positions of the Parties
      on Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making findings concerning the complainant’s credibility, the trial judge
    referred to the November 7, 2005 letter on three occasions. The appellant
    submits that the November 7, 2005 letter was a self-serving, prior consistent
    statement and that the trial judge committed a reversible legal error by
    relying on it to confirm the complainant’s allegations of violence and ultimately
    the complainant’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown does not agree that the trial judge used the November 7, 2005 letter
    impermissibly. The letter was introduced into evidence at trial by the defence
    and relied on as demonstrating the complainant’s motive for complaining to
    the police. Considered in this context, the trial judge’s reasons reflect
    nothing more than an effort to resolve an issue raised by the defence: whether
    the November 7, 2005 letter was an attempt at extortion or a reasonable proposal
    to protect the complainant’s interests while exploring the possibility of
    reconciliation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the complainant did not write the November 7, 2005 letter, I would not characterize
    it as a prior consistent statement.  Rather, the statements in the letter
    referring to abuse during the marriage were hearsay and I conclude that the
    trial judge used the letter impermissibly for the truth of its contents and
    to bolster the complainant’s credibility, and thereby committed reversible
    error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first occasion on which the trial judge referred to the November 7, 2005
    letter was under the heading “Credibility.” After rejecting defence counsel’s
    submission that the complainant’s evidence at trial was inconsistent with
    her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, the trial judge concluded that the
    complainant’s evidence with respect to the history of the marriage “was entirely
    consistent, made sense and was reliable.” The trial judge stated, “In short,
    I believe her.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then said she would address later in her reasons alleged inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s evidence concerning what happened at the four-way meeting
    and the November 7, 2005 letter. However, before turning to the appellant’s
    credibility, the trial judge set out the following conclusions concerning
    the four-way meeting and the November 7, 2005 letter:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Although I am left in doubt,
    as I will outline, with respect to what happened in a private discussion
    at that four-way meeting and who initiated the discussions, I do not conclude
    that [the complainant] lied and therefore should not be believed with respect
    to the events that transpired during the marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>In fact a review of the
      tone and purpose of the November 7th</i>, <i>2005, letter</i> which explores
      possible reconciliation written over a year after the parties separated, <i>confirms
      a history during the marriage of violence</i>. The proposed terms in the
      letter attempt to rectify the problems of dominance and control by [the
      appellant] by establishing [the complainant] with independence both psychologically,
      physically and financially. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second and third occasions on which the trial judge referred to the November
    7, 2005 letter were under the heading “The Four-Way Meeting and the November
    7, 2005 Letter.” The trial judge found that the complainant was mistaken
    in her trial evidence when she testified that she had not seen the November
    7, 2005 letter prior to trial. The trial judge then stated her conclusion
    that “the extortion theory does not hold water” and noted the proposal in
    the November 7, 2005 letter that the appellant would buy the complainant
    a one-bedroom condominium and a car prior to attempting reconciliation. With
    respect to this letter, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The November 7th, 2005 letter
    obviously speaks for itself, <i>but in my view it confirms the history of
    violence in the marriage</i>. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out certain excerpts from the November 7, 2005 letter dealing with
    the history of violence, the trial judge reviewed the evidence concerning
    what happened at the four-way meeting and who instigated the discussion about
    obtaining a condominium and a car. The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>What happened in the private
    meeting between [the third party] and [the complainant] based upon their
    conflicting evidence is unclear to me. However, this is a collateral matter
    to the matters before the court. On either person’s version of the events
    of what transpired during that private meeting I do not conclude that the
    November 7th, 2005 letter is an extortion letter seeking to obtain financial
    advantage in exchange for withdrawing the family and criminal proceedings.
    The criminal proceedings once initiated are in the hands of the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>The November 7th, 2005
      letter confirms the history of violence in the marriage</i> and provides
      a reasonable mechanism to allow [the complainant] and [the appellant] to
      explore reconciliation while providing [the complainant] with physical,
      emotional and financial independence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it may have been open to the trial judge to consider the allegations of violence
    in the November 7, 2005 letter for the purpose of assessing whether it was
    an attempt at extortion, in my view, the trial judge went beyond this limited
    use of the letter. In my opinion, the only reasonable interpretation of the
    trial judge’s reasons is that she used the November 7, 2005 letter impermissibly
    as proof of the truth of its contents and to bolster the complainant’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge repeatedly referred to the November 7, 2005 letter as “confirming” a
    history of violence in the marriage.  Had the trial judge merely been considering
    the effect of the allegations of violence on the proper interpretation of
    the November 7, 2005 letter, it would have been unnecessary for the trial
    judge to have referred to the letter as “confirming” anything.  Nowhere in
    her reasons did the trial judge refer to any limited purpose for which she
    was using the letter.  Moreover, the letter was written about a year after
    the criminal charges were laid and about ten months after the support application
    was launched. Accordingly, the statements in the letter about violence were
    not capable of rebutting an alleged motive to fabricate the allegations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, the statements in the November 7, 2005 letter referring to a
    history of violence were hearsay and were not admissible for the truth of
    their contents.  In my view, the trial judge’s findings indicate that she
    used the letter impermissibly for the truth of its contents to confirm the
    complainant’s allegations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge’s references to the November 7, 2005 letter formed an integral
    part of her assessment of the complainant’s credibility, I see no option
    but to find that they amount to a reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s
    convictions, and order a new trial.</p>
