  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial arose from a collision in which James Trakas, who was driving his Dodge
    Durango SUV, hit and killed a police officer, Police Constable Alan Kuzmich.  Both
    the Crown and the defence appeal from the jury’s verdict, which followed
    a seven-week trial presided over by McIsaac J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues two grounds of appeal regarding James Trakas’ acquittal for
    the offence of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220(b), <i>Criminal
    Code</i>): first, that the trial was rendered unfair by the defence closing
    submissions and, second, that the trial judge’s instructions on causation
    were misleading.  The Crown seeks a new trial on this charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>James
    Trakas argues two grounds of appeal regarding his conviction on the included
    offence of dangerous driving <i>simpliciter</i> (s. 249, <i>Criminal Code</i>):
    first, that the trial judge improperly interrupted the defence closing and,
    second, that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to consider the
    whole of the respondent’s driving on the night in question, rather than restricting
    the time frame to his driving at the time of <br>
    the impact.  The respondent seeks an acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    I am dealing with the Crown appeal or the Trakas appeal, I will refer to
    the Crown either as the Crown or as the appellant, and James Trakas as the
    respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both appeals.  </p>
  <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent had a motorcycle for sale.  A man arrived at his home and took
    the motorcycle for a test drive, leaving his pick-up truck in the respondent’s
    driveway.  Shortly thereafter, another man, who apparently had been hiding
    in the pick-up, drove it out of the respondent’s driveway.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The respondent realized that he had been tricked
    and that his motorcycle had been stolen.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    entered his Durango and chased the pick-up through residential and rural
    areas, including from the respondent’s residence to Highway 400, south on
    Highway 400 to Highway 89, east on Highway 89 to Highway 11 and south on
    Highway 11 to the 10th Concession.  The chase, which lasted about 25 minutes,
    covered approximately 46 kilometres of road.  During various stages of the
    chase, witnesses observed the vehicles running stop signs, tailgating, driving
    erratically, passing dangerously and making sudden lane changes.  Witnesses
    reported that the vehicles were driving at excessive speeds ranging from
    110 to 180 km/h.  The police estimated the respondent’s average speed at
    139 km/h on Highways 89 and 11 until shortly before the accident when he
    was caught in a line of traffic, although the route that formed the basis
    for this estimate was disputed at trial.  There was no direct evidence that
    the respondent was travelling over the 80 km/h speed limit at the time of
    the collision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    the chase, the respondent tried to stay in communication with the police
    using his cell phone.  However, he had to repeatedly redial because his cell
    phone disconnected due to intermittent coverage in the area.  During the
    calls, the respondent sought police intervention to assist him with his chase.  His
    last call, which lasted 11 minutes before it was cut off, was routed to a
    police call-taker at the South Simcoe Police Service,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> who liaised with the police dispatcher under the
    supervision of another officer.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police supervisor dispatched P.C. Kuzmich northbound on Highway 11.  P.C.
    Kuzmich radioed when he was approaching the 9th Concession and told the dispatcher
    that he intended to set up a spike belt at the 10th Concession.  Near the
    same time, the respondent gave the call-taker his location heading south
    on Highway 11 just past the 13th Concession.  The call-taker did not tell
    the respondent to cease his pursuit, although she did suggest that he should
    slow down and activate his hazard lights.  In the meantime, P.C. Kuzmich
    was not told that the call-taker had lost contact with the respondent or
    that the respondent did not know about his intended presence at the 10th
    Concession or of his plan to deploy a spike belt.  After the respondent’s
    call disconnected, the supervising police officer was recorded in the background
    saying, “I hope he’s not going to smash into one of my officers…  Tell him
    to back off.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    minutes later, the collision occurred.  At the time of the impact, the police
    officer was standing on the southbound lane of Highway 11.  P.C. Kuzmich
    was thrown approximately 88 meters and died from extremely traumatic injuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    eyewitness to the collision, David Rose, saw events unfold as he was travelling
    northbound on Highway 11.  He observed the police car parked on the northbound
    shoulder.  He also saw a line of about four to five vehicles travelling southbound
    towards him, one of which would have been the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Durango.  He saw nothing unusual about either the speed or the spacing of
    any of the southbound vehicles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rose first had the impression of the movement of a person coming from the
    shoulder of the southbound lane.  As he approached the point of impact, he
    saw the person, who turned out to be P.C. Kuzmich, standing “pretty well
    in the middle of the road” immediately beside his driver’s side window.  He
    then heard a thud.  It seems that, for some unknown reason, P.C. Kuzmich
    stepped onto Highway 11 into the direct path of the Durango in the split
    second after the vehicle in front of the Durango (likely the pick-up) had
    passed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    after the collision, Mr. Rose stopped and called 911.  At the request of
    the call-taker, he returned to the scene and gave his contact information
    to officers who were already investigating the collision.  They told him
    he would be contacted.  When he was not contacted within two days, he went
    to a police station and gave a statement of his observations.  David Rose
    was not called as a witness at trial by the Crown; he was called by the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence took the position that the respondent’s driving at the point of impact
    was neither criminally negligent nor dangerous because he was then driving
    in a line of traffic moving at normal speeds.  He therefore could not be
    convicted of either criminal negligence causing death or the included offence
    of dangerous driving.  In any event, the defence argued that the police officer’s
    act in stepping onto the highway was an independent intervening act that
    broke the chain of causation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was the trial Crown’s position that the respondent caused the police officer’s
    death because he was driving at an excessive rate of speed at the time of
    the impact.  The Crown argued that the respondent caused the officer’s death,
    even if the officer was on the road, because the officer was present at the
    scene in response to the danger created by the respondent; accordingly, the
    chain of causation was not broken by the officer’s act of stepping onto the
    road.  Alternatively, on the basis that the respondent’s driving was one
    continuous act from the start of the chase to its conclusion, the Crown argued
    that dangerous driving by the respondent during any part of the chase was
    sufficient for a conviction on the included offence of dangerous driving <i>simpliciter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s speed at the point of impact was a critical issue at trial.  Detective
    Constable Gordon Hebert, a York Regional Police accident reconstructionist,
    provided a report that estimated the respondent’s speed as excessive.  His
    opinion was based on a formula known as the Eubanks equation, which estimates
    the speed of a vehicle using the distance the pedestrian was thrown from
    the point of impact.  However, Jerry J. Eubanks, the author of the equation,
    prepared a report for the defence.  His report was based on the opinion of
    the pathologist, Dr. Nihad Hadi Ali-Ridha, who, at least initially, was certain
    that the police officer’s foot had been momentarily trapped under the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Durango’s tire.  In Eubanks’ opinion, the unusual mechanism of the impact
    would have affected the trajectory of the officer’s body so that his equation
    could not be used to mathematically model the respondent’s speed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anticipating
    that the Eubanks opinion would discredit the Hebert opinion, the Crown met
    with the pathologist in the midst of the trial and provided him with the
    officer’s shoe.  Because there was no tire mark on the shoe, the pathologist
    changed his opinion from being “certain” that the officer’s foot was trapped
    to an opinion that it was “possible” that the officer’s foot was trapped
    under the Durango’s tire. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    this change in opinion may have otherwise rehabilitated the Hebert opinion,
    that opinion was further found to be scientifically unsound by another Crown
    expert, John Mustard, a senior forensic engineer at the Centre of Forensic
    Sciences.  In the end, the Crown decided not to introduce the Hebert opinion.  As
    a result, there was no direct evidence at trial that the respondent’s speed
    was excessive at the time of the collision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Accordingly,
    the Crown relied on circumstantial evidence, which included the respondent’s
    earlier excessive speeds, the distance the officer's body was thrown, and
    the severe injuries to his body.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    the trial, the respondent was critical of the failure of the police call-taker
    and dispatcher to keep the respondent and P.C. Kuzmich informed about each
    other’s positions.  He was also critical of the prosecution, among other
    things, for the mid-trial meeting with the pathologist, resulting in the
    pathologist’s modification of his opinion about the mechanics of the impact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will first deal with the grounds of appeal arising from the defence closing
    followed by the appellant’s appeal regarding the charge on causation and
    the respondent’s appeal of his dangerous driving conviction. </p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       The defence closing
      and the judge's caution </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s trial counsel began his address to the jury by discussing why
    the right to trial by jury was important.  He told the jury that the police,
    the Crown attorneys and the judge were all paid by the government.  It was
    the role of the jury, which was the “voice of common sense and decency”,
    to hold the power of the state, with all its resources, in check.  In emphasizing
    the presumption of innocence, the defence counsel referred to several cases
    of wrongful conviction, arguing forcefully that it was unfair to have prosecuted
    the respondent, who had only followed the directions of the police call-taker,
    when none of the police personnel had been charged.  The closing attacked
    the “prosecution”, using ambiguous language that could be interpreted to
    include both the police and the Crown, and arguing that the prosecution was
    “tainted”, “blind”, that it could not be trusted, that the Crown was burying
    evidence, that the Crown advanced “false” information, and that the prosecution
    was “crippled by tunnel vision”.  The defence counsel pointed out that several
    important Crown witnesses, including the experts, were initially not told
    about David Rose’s evidence.  He also pointed to the mid-trial meeting that
    resulted in Dr. Ali-Rahdy altering his opinion.  He emphasized that the Crown
    had chosen not to call David Rose, and asked the jury to consider why the
    Crown would want to keep his evidence from them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the morning recess, the Crown objected to the defence closing and the trial
    was adjourned until the next morning for argument.  Upon resumption, the
    Crown sought a mistrial, which the trial judge refused.  After lengthy submissions,
    the trial judge cautioned the jury that certain of the defence submissions
    were “outside the rules”.  He told the jury that defence counsel ought not
    to have mentioned the wrongful convictions because those cases were not the
    jury’s concern; the jury should not be distracted by irrelevant considerations,
    and their focus was properly on the respondent’s trial.  In explaining why
    it was wrong for counsel to have suggested that the Crown had some ulterior
    motive in not calling Mr. Rose, the trial judge told the jury that, while
    there was an obligation on the Crown to disclose evidence, there was no obligation
    to call all possible witnesses.  In any event, he reminded the jury that
    Mr. Rose was called by the Crown to testify at the preliminary inquiry and,
    of course, the jury knew that Mr. Rose testified for the defence at trial.  The
    trial judge told the jury that the Crown is not permitted to explain why
    it did not call a certain witness, and that the trial was not about a competition
    between counsel, which might distract the jury into “a big sideshow”, but
    about the jury’s “ultimate task of considering the evidence”.  Finally, when
    the trial judge told the jury “to ignore that part of [defence counsel’s]
    address which constituted a personal attack on the Crown Attorneys”, he explained
    that the defence was free to attack the police and the witnesses, because
    the Crown would be able to respond to those attacks, but that the Crown was
    not able to respond to a personal attack.  </p>

    Crown argues that the trial judge ought to have granted a mistrial.  Alternatively,
    the Crown argues that the caution given was an inadequate remedy.  The Crown’s
    complaints can be grouped into two areas.  The first is the attacks on the
    conduct of the Crown, which include not calling David Rose, the altered opinion
    of the pathologist, and the decision to prosecute the respondent and not
    others.  In reference to those issues, the Crown argues that the trial judge
    failed to tell the jury explicitly that the Crown had not conducted itself
    improperly.  Second, the Crown argues in response to the defence closing
    regarding the resources of the state and the role of the jury that the trial
    judge erred in failing to provide a caution that offset the unfairness of
    these remarks and that precluded the prospect of jury nullification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence argues that the caution that was delivered was both unnecessary and
    unnecessarily compromised trial fairness and that the trial judge erred in
    concluding that the defence closing amounted to a personal attack on the
    Crown.  Alternatively, the defence argues that the trial judge erred in interrupting
    the defence closing because any necessary caution could have been included
    in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The approach to the
      issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    approach the respondent’s argument mindful that defence counsel is allowed
    considerable latitude in the contents of a jury closing and that such a closing
    should not be interrupted absent good reason.  Nonetheless, this court noted
    in <i>R. v. Snow</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 317 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 26 that, while counsel will normally be cut “considerable slack” and
    permitted to make closing addresses without interruption, a trial judge is “entitled
    to intervene once counsel crosses the accepted limits of what is permitted.”  The
    question on this appeal is whether those accepted limits were crossed and,
    if so, whether the trial judge’s caution provided an adequate remedy to ensure
    trial fairness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is important to bear in mind that a cornerstone of the defence
    position in this case was that the police, who were investigating the death
    of a fellow officer, approached their investigation with tunnel vision and
    with the benefit of considerable resources, which affected the reliability
    of their case.  The defence position is that these unusual circumstances
    put at issue the propriety of the police investigation and disclosure as
    well as the foundation for the experts’ opinions.  Accordingly, in my view,
    defence counsel should have been allowed significant latitude to argue that
    the case against the respondent lacked reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    for the reasons that follow, and while I acknowledge that the matter is not
    without its difficulties, it is my view that the trial judge did not make
    a reviewable error when he interpreted the defence closing as having crossed
    the line.  Given that conclusion, the trial judge was entitled to interrupt
    in the minimally intrusive way that he did.  He did not err in principle
    in the terms of the caution provided to the jury, particularly when that
    caution is considered in the context of the entirety of the trial.  I turn
    to the specific challenges raised by the Crown on appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(d)       The challenges to
      the closing</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US><i>(i)        The conduct of the Crown case</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no question that David Rose was the only eyewitness to the impact, that
    David Rose’s evidence placed the police officer on the road at the time of
    the impact, that the prosecution disclosed David Rose’s evidence to the accused
    and that the Crown did not provide its experts with David Rose’s evidence
    for the purpose of their initial expert reports.  It is also not in dispute
    that, while the Crown called David Rose as a witness at the preliminary inquiry,
    that it did not call him as a witness at trial.  The defence did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, just as the defence would be entitled to comment on the absence
    of evidence on a particular issue, such as an absence of evidence regarding
    motive or opportunity, so too the defence in this case was entitled to comment
    on the decision of the Crown not to call David Rose and to ask the jury to
    consider why the Crown did not call the only eyewitness to the impact or
    provide the experts about his evidence when they were asked to formulate
    their opinions.  This does not mean that the Crown was obliged to call David
    Rose as a witness.  Of course, it was not.  This was recognized by all counsel
    and by the trial judge.  See <i>R. v. Cook</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 481
    (S.C.C.)  Further, this was not a case where defence counsel asked the jury
    to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call the witness because,
    in this case, the witness had testified, albeit for the defence.  However,
    the defence did suggest that the strategy of ignoring David Rose’s evidence
    highlighted the prosecution’s tunnel vision and undermined the reliability
    of other evidence presented by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Different
    considerations apply to the different roles of those involved in the process:
    to the exercise of discretion by Crown counsel whether or not to call a particular
    witness; to an appeal court considering whether the Crown’s failure to call
    an important witness should result in a new trial; to a trial judge obliged
    to instruct the jury on the law regarding whether any inference can be drawn
    from the failure to call a witness, and to a defence counsel commenting on
    a Crown failure to call a witness.  In my view, each situation must be considered
    in context, and the defence in this case was at liberty to comment on the
    weaknesses of the Crown’s case, including its strategy in not calling David
    Rose, and in not giving David Rose’s evidence to the expert witnesses.  Similarly,
    the Crown was entitled in its closing to point out that David Rose’s evidence
    was available to the defence and was eventually given to the experts, just
    as the trial judge was entitled to tell the jury that the Crown is not obliged
    to call a particular witness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    while the defence was entitled to comment on the Crown’s tactics on these
    issues, it was not entitled to suggest that the Crown attorneys personally
    showed a lack of integrity in arriving at that strategy.  This is so for
    a number of reasons, most importantly because the trial was not about the
    personal integrity of the Crown attorneys, who would not be in a position
    in any event to respond to such allegations.  To the contrary, the jury’s
    mandate was to decide whether the Crown had established its case against
    the respondent and not to weigh and compare the integrity of the Crown and
    the defence.  If the defence wanted to challenge the Crown’s integrity, it
    could have sought an abuse of process ruling.  It did not.  See <i>Cook</i>,
    para. 58.  Accordingly, the question is whether the defence attacks on the “prosecution” in
    this case amounted to an attack on the Crown’s strategy and tactics or whether
    they amounted to an attack on the personal integrity of the Crown attorneys.  The
    former is permissible; the latter is not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    another judge may have come to a different conclusion regarding how the defence
    submissions would have been perceived by the jury, the trial judge was in
    the best position to make this call.  Indeed, this trial judge, who received
    full submissions, recognized that the issue was not clear cut.  He specifically
    observed that defence counsel was “very very skilful in the words he chose
    in presenting this to the jury.”  He also recognized that defence comment
    was fair, and noted that the question was not the comment, but the manner
    of the comment.  Accordingly, alive to the issues and the law, it was for
    the trial judge to weigh the defence closing in the context of the entire
    trial and to determine whether that closing risked distracting the jury from
    its task of determining the charges before the court and, if it did, to determine
    the appropriate remedy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Crown argues that the trial judge should have augmented his caution by
    telling the jury that it was irrelevant who else the police could have charged
    as a result of the officer’s death, this would have been obvious to the jury
    both as a matter of common sense and from the trial judge’s remonstrance
    in the caution to focus on the evidence in this trial, as well as in the
    instruction in his charge to decide the case against the respondent on the
    evidence.  Moreover, a fair reading of the defence submissions on this point
    does not convey the impression that counsel was suggesting the jury not convict
    the respondent simply because others had not been charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
    on this point, I note that in his charge to the jury, the trial judge put
    the defence position fairly and told the jury that it was for them to decide
    whether expert errors “amounted to an attempt to mislead anyone”.  He gave
    them the defence position that the pathologist “altered his opinion” to conform
    to the Crown theory and told them they must decide whether “these factors
    compromise the opinions advanced by the two experts.”  The jury retired,
    asked questions indicating that they were considering the proper issues,
    and returned with a verdict after two days of deliberations.  They clearly
    were not sidetracked into irrelevant considerations.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US><i>(ii)       The argument concerning jury nullification       </i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal Crown argues that the defence closing amounted to a request for jury
    nullification because counsel effectively told the jury to disregard the
    law and the evidence.  See <i>R. v. Latimer </i>(2001) 150 C.C.C. (3d) 129
    (S.C.C.).  However, I would reject this submission because the trial defence
    counsel did not tell the jury to decide the case in a manner inconsistent
    with the evidence and the law; rather, he argued that the evidence, or the
    absence of evidence, and the law did not support a finding of guilt.  Moreover,
    the jurors would have been aware that they were required to decide the case
    on the evidence because the trial judge specifically cautioned them to do
    so.  I find support for this conclusion from the fact that the trial Crown
    did not submit at the time that the defence closing amounted to a request
    for jury nullification.  I would not accept this submission on appeal; it
    is not supported by a review of the record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also do not accept the Crown’s argument that a further caution was needed
    about the defence counsel’s reference in his jury address to certain participants
    in the trial being paid by the government, including the trial judge.  While
    this reference by defence counsel was unhelpful, in my view, it was nothing
    more than rhetoric that would not have affected the jury’s deliberations.  The
    jury must be credited with a level of common sense and intelligence.  See <i>R.
    v. Trochym</i> (2007), 216 C.C.C. (3d) at para. 114 (S.C.C.).  I believe
    the trial judge aptly characterized this complaint when he rejected the Crown’s
    objection saying, “I may be getting like an armadillo in my old age, but
    I did not perceive anything directed towards me.  It is just that all these
    mass of resources including the Court system is, is that big huge government
    and here is little Mr. Trakas backed up against that.  It is sort of a Leviathan
    and Minnow analogy.”  I agree.  The defence submission on this issue was
    simply a reflection, albeit a colourful one, intended to illustrate that
    the police investigation and the state possessed considerable resources when
    contrasted with those of the respondent.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US><i>(iii)     Conclusion on the defence closing</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that a retrospective parsing of selections of the defence closing
    would demonstrate that a caution from the trial judge was not essential in
    the circumstances of this case, and that any concerns could have been adequately
    addressed in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  However, assuming that
    is so, it is not for this court to second guess the trial judge, who was
    required to make an immediate decision about whether a caution was necessary.  In
    this case, considering the defence closing and the trial as a whole, the
    trial judge was clearly of the view that the closing risked distracting the
    jury from deciding the case on the evidence.  In those circumstances, it
    was open to the trial judge to decide to caution the jury.  In my view, the
    trial judge’s decision to provide a caution was not an error in principle,
    but an exercise of judgment with which this court should not interfere on
    appeal. Further, in my view, the trial judge’s instructions were sufficient
    to allay any prejudice to the Crown, without causing unfair prejudice to
    the defence.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US><i>(iv)      The interruption and the application for
        a mistrial</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the closing in this case, particularly when considered in conjunction with
    the trial judge’s remedial caution, did not rise to the “clearest of cases” necessary
    to dictate a mistrial.  See for example, <i>R. v. Toutissani,</i> [2007]
    O.J. No. 4364 at para. 9 (C.A.), where MacPherson J.A. endorsed the statement
    that “[t]he declaration of a mistrial, like the declaration of a stay, should
    be granted only as a last resort, in the clearest of cases and where no remedy
    short of that relief will adequately redress the actual harm occasioned”.  In
    this case, the trial judge assessed the effectiveness of a potential caution
    and properly remedied any issues arising from the defence closing; resort
    to a mistrial became unnecessary.  I would not interfere with his exercise
    of discretion.  See <i>R. v. Liu</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 233 at paras.
    23-24 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I accept the respondent’s submission that the trial judge improperly interrupted
    the defence address.  Having determined that the defence overstepped accepted
    parameters for a closing, the trial judge minimized any prejudice to the
    defence by not interrupting the closing mid-address.  Instead, he waited
    until the morning recess to discuss the matter with counsel.  When those
    discussions led to an adjournment of the trial until the next day, the trial
    judge simply informed the jury that “an important procedural matter has come
    up” and that they should not speculate about its contents.  Thus, the jury
    was not told that the interruption was related in any way to the contents
    of the defence address.  At the conclusion of his caution, the trial judge
    explained to the jury that the closing addresses would continue the next
    day and noted that “both sides have been assisting me”, a comment that did
    not demean the defence position in any way and would have suggested that
    the defence had been working together with the Crown and the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    after the judge delivered his caution, the defence counsel resumed his closing
    without interruption and, in doing so, properly focussed his challenge on
    the alleged mistakes in the investigation and told the jury to consider those
    mistakes in assessing the Crown’s case.  This was proper closing and successfully
    made the point that was important to the defence.  The point was reiterated
    by the trial judge in his charge to the jury.  Accordingly, I would reject
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>(b)       Causation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial Crown took the position that, since the police officer was killed when
    he was acting in the course of duty responding to the respondent’s calls
    for help, the respondent factually and legally caused his death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the Crown challenges the trial judge’s instructions on causation
    on three bases.  The Crown argues that the trial judge erred first, by failing
    to provide the required instruction on whether the victim’s actions were
    an independent intervening act; second, by introducing the concept of contributory
    negligence as something that could break the chain of causation; and third,
    by providing a charge that was unduly confusing because it left the jury
    to decide the issue as a “moral reaction”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    considering these challenges individually, I note that the trial judge charged
    the jury in accordance with <i>R. v. Nette</i>, (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 486
    (S.C.C.).  In <i>Nette</i>, Arbour J. explained that criminal causation,
    in addition to factual causation, requires legal causation, which involves
    asking whether the accused
    “should be held criminally responsible for the consequences that occurred”
    based on a consideration of “whether the result can fairly be said to be
    imputable to the defendant”.  She quoted from G. Williams’ description of
    this further test as “a moral reaction” in <i>Textbook of Criminal Law</i> (2nd
    ed. 1983) at pp. 381-82.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the jury asked a question about the meaning of
    “significant cause”, the trial judge instructed the jury in line with the
    decision of Hill J. in <i>R. v. Menezes </i>(2001), 50 C.R. (5th) 343 (Ont.
    S.C.J.) regarding the determination of causation.  Counsel do not take issue
    with this aspect of the charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to another defence objection, the trial judge further charged the
    jury telling them that there was a “clear distinction” between factual and
    legal causation and that factual causation was not at issue in this case.  After
    further discussions, the trial judge recharged the jury about the positions
    of the Crown and defence on the issue of causation.  The Crown argues that
    this last instruction did not repeat the legal test, and the trial judge
    erred in telling the jury that “the alleged contributory negligence of Constable
    Kuzmich” should be part of the jury’s consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the argument on appeal, I take into consideration that the Crown
    did not challenge these instructions at the time and expressly agreed with
    the trial judge’s re-charge given in response to the jury’s question seeking
    an explanation of “significant cause”.  Although not determinative, this
    suggests that the trial Crown did not see any prejudice arising from the
    charge as a whole.  See <i>R. v. Nguyen</i> (2000), 35 C.R. (5th) 245 at
    para. 30 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Chandrakumar</i> (2007), 231 O.A.C. 30 at para. 34.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the Crown’s first challenge, the Crown argues that the trial judge erred
    by not instructing the jury that the officer’s actions were not an independent
    intervening act because the officer acted due to “mistake, intimidation or
    other similar pressure” created by the respondent.  I do not agree.  This
    phraseology comes from the reasons of Gillese J.A. in the related case of <i>R.
    v.</i> <i>Shilon</i>, December 11, 2006, unreported (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Shilon</i>,
    the question was whether the actions of Trakas could be sufficient to sever
    the chain of causation for Shilon, the alleged driver of the pick-up, who
    was facing a committal on the same charge of criminal negligence causing
    death.  In this case, the Crown argues that the officer acted on mistake,
    intimidation or other similar pressure exerted by Trakas so that his stepping
    onto the road was not an independent intervening act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two things to be said about this argument.  First, the trial judge’s
    instructions clearly put before the jury the question of whether the officer’s
    presence on the road was in some way a response to the actions of the respondent
    in initiating and pursuing the chase or whether it was an independent intervening
    act.  The trial judge specifically instructed the jury to consider whether
    the collision was
    “within the scope of the risk created by James Trakas when he was involved
    in a high-speed pursuit of Mr. Shilon over this great distance.”  He also
    put forward the Crown’s position that the officer’s action in stepping on
    the road was not an independent intervening cause because he attended at
    the scene only in response to the dangerous situation created by the respondent.  Second,
    the instruction on legal causation was correctly based on <i>Nette.  </i>The
    jury’s subsequent question was answered in the words of <i>Menezes. </i> Among
    other instructions, the trial judge instructed the jury that a legally blameworthy
    cause must be “at least a significant” cause and “more than one that is trifling
    or minor.”    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in these instructions.  The Crown raises <i>Shilon</i> for the
    first time on appeal, a decision that was released in the midst of the respondent’s
    trial.  It is noteworthy that the trial Crown did not request this additional
    instruction from the trial judge.  In any event, in my view, the law was
    adequately encompassed by the trial judge’s instruction to consider whether
    the officer was present on the road in response to the respondent’s conduct
    or whether the officer’s presence on the road was an independent intervening
    cause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the Crown’s second argument about the trial judge’s use of the words “contributory
    negligence” in a re-charge, it is my view that, although these words import
    a civil concept not recognized in criminal law<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>, they would not have misled this jury about the
    relevant question of whether the respondent significantly contributed to
    the officer’s death and would not have been interpreted by the jury as qualifying
    the charge on “intervening act”, particularly when considered in light of
    the repeatedly correct instructions contained in the charge as a whole.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third challenge to the charge alleges that it was confusing because the trial
    judge distinguished between factual and legal causation even though <i>Nette</i> specifically
    instructed that a jury ought not to be told to undertake a two-part analysis
    and this would have left the jury to decide the case as a “moral reaction”.  See <i>Nette</i> at
    paras. 46, 66-72.  I do not accept this argument in the circumstances of
    this case.  Factual causation was simply not an issue; the respondent hit
    the officer with his
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Durango and caused the officer’s death.  The issue, as the jury was told
    and would have appreciated, was whether there was any independent intervening
    act by the officer that severed the link of causation to the respondent’s
    conduct.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal on this ground.</p>
  <h3>(c)       Dangerous driving as an included offence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s appeal challenges the trial judge’s instruction that the jury
    was to consider the entirety of the respondent’s driving when determining
    whether the Crown had proven the included offence of dangerous driving <i>simpliciter</i>.  The
    respondent argues that the only relevant time for an assessment of his driving
    was at the point of impact, when he was driving in a line of cars at a normal
    highway speed, and that his earlier driving was too remote to constitute
    the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus </i>of the offence of criminal negligence causing death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument is based on s. 581 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which requires that
    each count in an indictment “shall, in general, apply to a single transaction.”  The
    respondent argues that since the indictment contained a single charge that
    alleged culpable homicide, the transaction at issue only concerned his driving
    at the time of the impact because that is when the officer’s death occurred.  I
    disagree for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the respondent had fair notice that the offence charged included the offence
    of dangerous driving in relation to all his driving during the chase.  Indeed,
    the trial was conducted in a manner that the respondent’s entire driving
    conduct was clearly at issue and the included offence of dangerous driving
    was included in both the Decision Ladder and the Verdict Sheet provided to
    the jury.  Moreover, the trial judge told the jury that a verdict of dangerous
    driving, or dangerous driving causing death, was available on the evidence,
    including the evidence of the entire chase. That evidence included the respondent’s
    aggressive driving and speeding in the moments before the impact until he
    was slowed down by the line of traffic.  The defence took no objection to
    the trial judge’s instruction to the jury to consider the entirety of the
    respondent’s driving and, indeed, in his closing to the jury, defence counsel
    said that he anticipated the Crown would ask the jury “to convict Mr. Trakas
    based on his driving before the accident”, but asked the jury to bear in
    mind that Mr. Trakas was on his cell phone with the police dispatcher throughout
    this time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the transaction could not realistically be dissected into separate components
    of time or transactions in the manner proposed by the respondent.  A continuous
    course of dangerous driving was what was alleged, a single transaction, albeit
    one that culminated in the officer’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the indictment itself does not confine the time frame to the location or
    time of the collision.  It charges that the respondent “at the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Innisfil, in the Central East Region, and elsewhere in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario”<b> </b>did by criminal negligence cause the death of P.C. Kuzmich.  Accordingly,
    the indictment relies on the chase from its inception in Innisfil to its
    tragic conclusion at the 10th Concession.  The respondent’s driving before
    the impact cannot be said to be a separate transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the respondent is correct that more than one transaction
    was alleged, the trial judge effectively divided the count in his charge
    to the jury, without objection from the defence and without causing any unfairness
    or prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury obviously concluded that the respondent’s driving during the pursuit
    was dangerous.  This conclusion was based on ample evidence, including the
    multiple examples of the respondent’s unacceptable and unsafe manoeuvring
    of his vehicle through the entire driving sequence, including immediately
    before he was slowed down by the cars ahead of him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the evidence of dangerous driving cannot be excused, as argued by the defence,
    on the basis of the respondent’s ongoing communications with the police during
    the chase.  Even if it could, the respondent failed to comply with the police
    instructions, including their instructions to slow the speed of his vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would also dismiss the respondent’s appeal on this issue.</p>
  <h3>RESULT</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons as set out above, I would dismiss the appeals of both the appellant
    and the respondent. </p>
