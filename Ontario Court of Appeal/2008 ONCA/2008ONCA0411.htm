    is an appeal from a pleadings motion to strike the appellants’ statement
    of claim in a proposed class proceeding that challenges the provision of
    autism and education services to children with autism.  The appellants (respondents

    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    motion judge, Cullity J., struck a number of the appellants’ causes of action.  The
    appeal relates only to the striking of the claims for negligence, breach
    of fiduciary duty, breach of s.  7, and the claim for <i>Charter </i>damages.  The
    appellants also argue that their claims against the school boards should
    not have been struck because the school boards only sought to strike certain
    paragraphs in the statement of claim and not the claims against them in their
    entirety.    Ontario cross-appeals the motion judge’s refusal to strike the
    s. 15(1) <i>Charter</i> claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>The
      appellants do not appeal the striking of their claim, with leave to amend,
      regarding “</span>the arbitrary age for the commencement of receiving educational
      services and the under-inclusiveness of pre-school education for children
      with disabilities”, which was struck because they lacked sufficient clarity

    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part.  I would strike
    the appellants’
    age-based discrimination claim.  While I agree with the motion judge that
    certain aspects of the s. 15(1) claim based on disability discrimination
    may be sustainable in law, at least at the pleadings stage, those aspects
    of the statement of claim do not currently constitute a concise pleading
    as required by rule 25.06 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194.  Accordingly, I would strike the disability discrimination
    claim with leave to amend.  I would grant the appellants leave to amend their
    negligence claim against the school boards regarding operational aspects
    of the programs.  Finally, I would grant the appellants leave to amend their
    claim for <i>Charter</i> damages based on alleged negligent <i>Charter</i> breaches.  I
    would otherwise dismiss both the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    acronyms are used to describe autism-directed services.  Applied Behaviour
    Analysis (ABA), which is the broadest of the terms, is an autism treatment
    based on behaviour modification.  It includes Intensive Behavioural Intervention
    (IBI).  The Intensive Early Intervention Program (IEIP) is a program that
    reflects IBI treatment, but it is specifically designed by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario for two to five-year-old children.  While the appellants’ statement
    of claim addresses the IEIP, it also refers to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    ABA and IBI.  This makes it difficult to know what the appellants are actually
    seeking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    task faced by the motion judge was further complicated by the content and
    structure of the appellants’ statement of claim.  In part, the motion judge
    attributed the difficulties with the pleading to its layered amendments,
    which attempted to respond to the release of decisions from this court such
    as <i>Wynberg v. Ontario </i>(2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 561, leave to appeal refused, <span class=ssl2>[</span><span class=hit>2006]
    S.C.C.A. No. 441</span>, <i>Eliopoulos v. Ontario</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d)
    321, leave to appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 514, and <i>A.L. v. Ontario</i> (2006),
    83 O.R. (3d) 512, leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 36.  However,
    the motion judge accurately observed at para. 7 that the amended amended
    statement of claim amounted to an “attempt to simultaneously bombard all
    targets from all angles with every available piece of ammunition”.  The problem
    is exacerbated on appeal because the appellants advised that they would further
    amend the pleading to delete all paragraphs relevant to the public misfeasance
    claim that was struck by the motion judge.  Since they have not yet done
    so, it continues to be difficult to correlate the appellants’ allegations
    of fact with their proposed causes of action.  This was, and remains, a major
    problem affecting any determination of the viability of the appellants’ claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the appellants’ claims appear to focus on alleged deficiencies in the respondents’
    provision of services for school-age children with autism, including the
    provision of, or denial of, ABA by Ontario and, in particular, the respondents
    refusal to provide ABA in public schools.  The appellants do not define with
    any clarity what they mean by
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    ABA.  They argue that a refusal to provide the appellants with ABA in public
    schools amounts to a “policy of mutual exclusivity”, which they say means
    that the representative children, who are eligible for both the IEIP and
    public education, are not being accommodated in a manner that allows them
    to take advantage of their entitlement to public education.  The appellants
    also challenge the historical restriction of the IEIP to children under age
    six, although that age restriction was lifted in 2005.  They also challenge
    the IEIP’s limited budget and its waiting list.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s decision, striking out some claims and allowing others to
    proceed, primarily rested on his interpretation of <i>Wynberg.</i>  In that
    case, this court dismissed an action brought by other parents of children
    with autism.  The action against Ontario included a claim of age-based discrimination
    on the basis that the IEIP was not provided to children aged six and over,
    in public school or otherwise, even though it was provided to the comparator
    group of younger children two to five years of age.  It also included a disability
    discrimination claim under s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> based on the argument
    that Ontario failed to provide a special education program or service consistent
    with the IEIP contrary to s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i>.  Thus, the
    issue in <i>Wynberg</i> was whether any differential treatment constituted
    discrimination on the basis of age and disability in violation of the <i>Charter</i>.  This
    court allowed an appeal from the trial judge’s decision and dismissed the <i>Wynberg</i> claim
    in its entirety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    doing so, the decision in <i>Wynberg</i> concluded that the IEIP could not
    be harmonized with the public education system.  It observed that <span lang=EN-US>“important
    features of the IEIP” - such as the number of hours required, the segregated
    settings, the variety of delivery sites, and the range of skilled personnel
    needed - did not suit the school environment (paras. 59, 76, 123-126).  </span>It
    also concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that the IEIP
    was the only appropriate program for students with autism or a finding that
    appropriate programs had been made available to comparable groups of students
    with other disabilities (paras. 128-144).  Moreover, the court determined
    that the IEIP program for younger children was a targeted ameliorative program
    that did not demean the human dignity of the older children.  Consequently,
    this court concluded that a s. 15(1) breach had not been proven and dismissed
    the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    question before the motion judge was whether the decision in <i>Wynberg </i>disposed
    of the issues advanced by the appellants in their proposed class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    this context in mind, I will deal with each of the issues raised in the appeal
    and cross-appeal.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3><i>Section 15(1) </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    s. 15(1) equality claim was the primary focus of oral argument on appeal.  The
    two challenged bases of the claim related to discrimination on the basis
    of age and discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario
    argues that the motion judge erred in failing to strike the appellants’ s.
    15(1) claims, primarily because they cannot be distinguished from the s.
    15(1) claims struck in <i>Wynberg</i>.  </p>
  <h3><i>(a)       Age-based discrimination</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In <i>Wynberg</i>,
      this court determined that the government did not violate the s. 15(1)
      rights of children with autism on the basis of the age limit for the IEIP.  It
      concluded that, while there was differential treatment of children with
      autism aged six and over, the evidence did not support a finding that this
      constituted discrimination </span><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN> </span></span><span
lang=EN>(paras. 35-80).  </span>In any event, based on evidence about the age-targeted

      this case, the motion judge determined that the appellants pled sufficiently
      different facts to support a s. 15(1) infringement on the basis of age

      the application of the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> precludes the

lang=EN>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
      motion judge understood the thrust of the appellants’ submission to be
      that the <i>Wynberg</i> decision was based on findings of fact “inconsistent
      with the facts that have been pleaded in this case.”  In particular, the
      decision in <i>Wynberg</i> was premised on evidence that younger children
      were best able to benefit from the IEIP and that the intensive nature of
      the IEIP did “not fit well” for older children in full-time attendance
      at school.  The appellants argued, however, that the factual allegations
      in their pleadings, if proven, could satisfy the four contextual factors
      identified in <i>Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>,
      [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 even if the proven facts in <i>Wynberg</i> could not.  Specifically,
      the appellants argued that their pleading alleges pre-existing vulnerability
      and stereotyping of older children with autism by the perception that those
      children could not benefit from ABA; that the denial of publicly-funded
      ABA to older children does not correspond to any distinction in their needs;
      that the nature of the IEIP for younger children could not be considered
      ameliorative because it was based on a misconception about the older children’s
      ability to benefit from ABA, and the denial of ABA would deprive the older
      children of skills they need for full membership in the community.<i></i></span></p>

      problem is that these arguments were all finally disposed of by <i>Wynberg</i>,
      which concluded that the IEIP for younger children with autism did not
      discriminate on the basis of age.  Specifically, the court in <i>Wynberg</i> concluded
      that all children with autism suffer disadvantage from stereotyping, but
      that stereotyping was based on the characteristic of their autism, rather
      than on the age of the children.  Thus, the failure to implement the IEIP
      in schools did not reinforce age-based discrimination.  Rather, the IEIP
      was an ameliorative program designed to meet the specific needs of the
      younger children in a manner that did not demean the older children.  <i>Wynberg</i> also
      determined that the intensive nature of the IEIP program could not fit
      with full-time attendance at school.<i></i></span></p>

      simply pleading that an undefined form of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    ABA, as a subset of IEIP, is feasible for children in full-time school.  This
    imprecise nuance is insufficient to overcome the binding decision in <i>Wynberg</i>,

      there was no “evidentiary gap” in <i>Wynberg</i> relevant to the finding
      regarding age-discrimination.  In addition, the appellants plead no new
      facts in this action that were not before the court in <i>Wynberg</i>.  The
      additional “new”
    facts identified by the motion judge are really conclusions of fact, the
    same ones that were already rejected in <i>Wynberg</i>.  For example, while
    the court in <i>Wynberg</i> held that autistic children aged six and over
    have not been subject to historical disadvantage and stereotyping on account
    of their age, the appellants simply plead that children over six have been
    subject to such historical disadvantage, without providing any supporting
    facts.  Accordingly, the appellants are asking for a different conclusion
    based on the same facts that were before the court in <i>Wynberg</i>.  The
    conclusions that were rejected in <i>Wynberg</i>, and that the appellants
    seek to prove in this case, are based on social and legislative fact evidence,
    not on facts relevant to the particular parties before the court.  The appellants’ claim
    that they will call different evidence does not amount to the compelling

      motion judge found that the statement of claim alleged a s. 15(1) breach
      by the respondents based on their failure to provide children with autism
      aged six and over with special education programs and services appropriate
      to their needs when such programs or services are provided to children
      with other disabilities and a failure to permit children with autism to
      receive ABA treatment in publicly funded schools.  On these claims, the </span>motion
      judge correctly recognized that, absent different factual allegations,
      the <i>Wynberg</i> determination that a s. 15(1) disability discrimination
      claim had not been established was binding.  However, the motion judge
      concluded that the allegations by the appellants in this case were substantially
      different from those in <i>Wynberg</i>.  In this case, the appellants pled
      that the representative children were entitled to a harmonized form of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    ABA and education in the public school system.  They pled, or could plead,
    that a form of ABA, not amounting to the IEIP, could be available for this
    purpose and that the respondents have developed analogous programs for children
    in the comparator group of children with communication difficulties.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition and importantly, the appellants base their equality claim on a duty
    to accommodate, rather than on the <i>Wynberg</i> basis that the respondents
    breached their statutory duty to provide the IEIP to school-age children.  As
    well, the appellants’ argument is not about eligibility for the IEIP, as
    was the case in <i>Wynberg</i> because, in this case, the representative
    children are already IEIP-eligible.  Accordingly, the appellants argue that
    this case is not about the denial of the IEIP, but about the denial by Ontario
    and the school boards to accommodate simultaneous access to both ABA and
    public education.  In addition, this case is different from <i>Wynberg</i> because
    the school boards are parties; they were not in <i>Wynberg</i>.  On this
    basis, the motion judge concluded, at this early pleadings stage, that the
    claims in this case are different from and require a different analysis than
    in <i>Wynberg</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge read the appellants’
    statement of claim extremely generously; it is far from clear that the appellants
    can plead a disability claim that is compellingly different from that already
    determined in <i>Wynberg</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it is possible that the appellants can plead a claim based upon the respondents’ duty
    to accommodate and a denial of that duty.  That denial would be based on
    the comparator group of other children with disabilities in the communication
    category, including children who are deaf, blind or deaf/blind.  <i>Wynberg</i> specifically
    found an evidentiary gap regarding the availability of accommodation to the
    comparator group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    succeed in creating a viable claim, the appellants would have to plead that
    the claimed and defined benefit is an appropriate accommodation and that
    it could be delivered in the public school system.  It would be necessary
    to demonstrate that children with autism do not receive appropriate accommodation
    for their education and that the claimed benefit is an appropriate accommodation
    for school-age children with autism.  See <i>Wynberg</i>, paras. 122-137.   In
    addition, the appellants must prove that the comparator group does receive
    appropriate accommodation that is available to all members of the group.  It
    may be that the appellants can plead, for example, that all persons in the
    comparator group have a process available to determine their accommodation,
    while the appellants do not have such a process available because the respondents
    have effectively denied them the benefit they are seeking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    leads to Ontario’s argument that the appellants’
    disability discrimination claim must be struck because the “benefit” they
    are claiming is not pleaded with the necessary precision. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario relies on para. 127 from <i>Wynberg</i>, which commented on the importance
    of precision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It may be that, with changes, intensive behavioural
    intervention using a number of elements of the IEIP could be provided within
    the public school system. However that possibility presents a moving target
    and would depart from both the benefit claimed and the trial judge's order.
    Precision is important if the comparative analysis required by s. 15(1) is
    to be properly carried out. It is the benefit as claimed and ordered that
    we must evaluate.</p>

    this extract could be read as an observation regarding the plaintiffs’ change
    in position about the proposed benefit from that initially claimed and set
    out in the trial judge’s order, it is nevertheless essential that the appellants
    plead the benefit with precision.  The absence of precision will be fatal
    to the appellants’ claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the appellants have variously described the benefit as ABA, or some form
    of ABA, access to IBI, appropriate educational services or by ill-defined
    expressions such as, education services from which they can benefit to the
    same extent as can children without disabilities.  This language not only
    lacks the necessary precision to allow the respondents to craft a defence,
    it is inadequate for the purposes of defining the remedy sought.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the pleadings in this case require substantial redrafting if they
    are to meet the requirements for pleading generally, and particularly for
    a constitutional remedy.  Otherwise the appellants are unlikely to avoid
    the conclusion that their cause of action is precluded on the basis of <i>stare
    decisis</i> in light of this court’s decision in <i>Wynberg</i>.  Accordingly,
    I would strike the entirety of the appellants’ s. 15(1) claim, with leave
    to amend.  In this manner, once the appellants have concisely delineated
    their claims, the respondents will be in a position to respond to the allegations
    of fact relevant to the causes of action that have been allowed to proceed
    and can bring any appropriate motions.</p>

    the appellants are able to successfully restructure their s. 15(1) discrimination
    claim, it may well also be necessary to restructure their s.  1 claim, which
    argues that the s. 15(1) breaches are not reasonable and justifiable limits
    within the context of a s.  1 analysis.  The sufficiency of this aspect of
    the pleading can only be determined after the appellants amend their s. 15(1)
    claim.  Accordingly, I would also strike the s.  1 claim, with leave to amend.</p>

    appellants claim damages on the basis that they were required to buy private
    autism services because the government did not make public services available.  The
    motion judge correctly noted the principle that damages are not available
    in conjunction with a declaration of constitutional invalidity, absent improper
    purposes.  This court in <i>Wynberg</i> affirmed that this principle is not
    limited to cases where a statute is declared unconstitutional; it also applies
    to other government action (para. 194).  I would not give effect to the appellants’ argument
    distinguishing between government legislative action and government bureaucratic
    action.  In any event, their statement of claim fails to articulate the bureaucratic
    conduct at issue.  </p>

    evidence that the government acted <i>negligently</i>, abusively, or in bad
    faith.  Finally, in <i>Wynberg</i>, this court held at para. 202 that
    “[a]bsent bad faith, abuse of power, <i>negligence</i> or willful blindness

    a remedy in conjunction with a declaration of unconstitutionality.”  [Emphasis

    parties agree that the government is exempt from liability in tort for negligence
    in making policy decisions.  The motion judge struck the appellants’
    negligence claim on the basis that the pleadings did not disclose that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario’s decision about the provision of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">

    when a policy decision is implemented, a private law duty of care may arise
    regarding its operation: see <i>Just v. British Columbia</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R.
    1228.  In attempting to characterize the government action here as operational,
    the appellants pled that both
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the school boards “created, implemented and operated” a system
    that denied the benefits of free public education to children receiving
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    ABA. As well, the appellants pled that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the school boards permitted “incompetent or insufficiently qualified” persons
    to design, implement and administer the programs and failed to adequately
    staff, administer and monitor the programs.  The appellants also argued that
    the respondents’ failure to harmonize
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    ABA and public education was an operational decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    regard to the claim against Ontario, I agree with the motion judge’s conclusion
    that “[i]f decisions to provide ABA and other educational programs are policy
    decisions that do not give rise to a duty of care, a decision as to the appropriate
    harmonisation of such programs cannot, in my judgment, sensibly be characterised
    otherwise.”  This issue was specifically addressed in <i>Wynberg </i>at para.
    255<i>, </i>where this court dismissed similar claims as relating not to
    operational failures, but rather to
    “government decision-making about the scope of the IEIP and the services
    to be provided within the special education system”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also agree with the motion judge’s assessment that the allegations against
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario regarding staffing and monitoring of the programs relate to policy
    decisions and not operational decisions.  As found in <i>Wynberg</i>, these
    challenges relate essentially to the scope of the programs, rather than to
    their operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario must be struck without leave to amend.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants made similar allegations against the school boards.  I agree with
    the motion judge that the pleadings as they stand do not delineate any separate
    operational decisions by the school boards.  Therefore, the allegations against
    the school boards must fail for the same reason.  However, bearing in mind
    that the school boards did not seek to strike this claim, I would give the
    appellants leave to amend their claim regarding operational decisions taken
    by the school boards.  I would not rule at this stage that the appellants
    will be unable to fashion a pleading regarding school board negligence based
    on the operational aspects of the challenged programs.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal the motion judge’s finding regarding alleged breaches of
    fiduciary duties by the respondents.  The motion judge found that, even assuming
    the existence of a fiduciary relationship, any duties arising from the respondents’ discretionary
    powers are owed to the public at large and not to the appellants.  In essence,
    the motion judge concluded that the appellants’ fiduciary duty claim, set
    out in four paragraphs of their statement of claim, failed for the same reason
    that the negligence claim failed - because the alleged acts and omissions
    stemmed from an immune policy decision regarding the programs at issue.</p>

    this is not a case where the respondents were charged with administering
    the appellants’ funds.  Rather, it is a case about the allocation of general
    revenues for the education of children, all of whom are vulnerable and many
  of whom have disabilities analogous to those of the appellant children.  </p>

    ).  By contrast, the government may be in a fiduciary relationship where
    there is legislative instruction requiring the government to act in an individual’s
    interest, or where there is an assumption of responsibility on the part of
    the government: see the <i>Authorson </i>decisions.  </p>

      paras. 256-257, the court in <i>Wynberg</i> examined the nature of the
      duties imposed under s. 7(1)(a) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>,
      R.S.O. 1990 c. C.11 and s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i>.  The former
      provision provides the Minister of Community and Social Services with the
      discretion to establish the IEIP, whereas the latter provision sets out
      the scope of the Minister of Education’s responsibilities in relation to
      special education services.  This court concluded that duties created by
      these sections are owed to the public as a whole, rather than to individual
      users. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>In
      my opinion, the alleged fiduciary duties that the appellants claim are
      owed to children with autism and their families (listed at para. 187 of
      their statement of claim) in fact relate to the statutory duties discussed
      in <i>Wynberg</i>.  As the court in <i>Wynberg</i> concluded, these statutory
      duties are owed to the public as a whole and involve balancing multiple
      interests, including the allocation of limited public funds.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have failed to delineate legal or practical interests that differentiate
    them from other vulnerable groups who also have claims for similar programs
    and services.  I agree with the motion judge that the fiduciary duty claim
    against the respondents fails for essentially the same reasons as the negligence
    claim.  The appellants have not pled any facts other than the appellant children’s
    vulnerability and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s policy decision to ground their claim for fiduciary duty.  They
    have also not pled any facts to ground a separate claim against the school
    boards apart from their implementation of

  <h3><i>Section 7 </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge struck the appellants’ s. 7 claim.  I reject the appellants’
    arguments that both the waiting times for
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    ABA and the alleged policy of mutual exclusivity infringe their s.  7 <i>Charter</i> rights
    to security of the person, their rights not to be subjected to arbitrary
    laws and their rights not to be subjected to discriminatory laws.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants plead that their rights to security of the person were infringed
    because wait lists and the alleged policy of mutual exclusivity created unreasonable
    obstacles hindering their use of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    ABA and educational services.  The motion judge concluded that the court
    in <i>Wynberg</i> determined this issue when it held that the security of
    the person is affected only where an individual suffers a <i>deprivation</i> on
    account of government action.  In <i>Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia, </i>[2004] 3 S.C.R. 657 at paras. 64-67, the Supreme Court
    of Canada also rejected a comparable argument that British Columbia’s refusal
    to fund any IBI services violated s.  7.  Government action in not providing
    specific programs to the appellants cannot be said to <i>deprive</i> the
    appellants of constitutionally protected rights. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the motion judge also erred by characterizing their
    s.  7 claim as being about “access” to services, which was the claim advanced
    in <i>Wynberg</i>.  They argue that their claim is different because it is
    about the “use”
    of services.  This distinction is problematic for two reasons.  First, the
    appellants did not plead any facts about “using” the services, but rather
    specifically pleaded that the wait lists constituted an obstacle “for access
    to the IEIP” and that other obstacles prevented children from “accessing” the
    services.  Second, the distinction between the ability to use a service,
    as opposed to the ability to access the service, is not sufficiently delineated
    to distinguish the appellants’ claims from <i>Wynberg</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    arbitrariness, the appellants argue that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario failed to provide a justifiable rationale for waiting lists and the
    alleged policy of mutual exclusivity.  In <i>Chaoulli v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec</i>, <span lang=EN-US>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 791 at para. 130, McLachlin
    C.J. and Major J. explained</span> that a law is arbitrary where
    “it bears no relation to, or is inconsistent with, [its] objective”.  Regardless
    of whether the wait lists or the alleged policy of mutual exclusivity qualify
    as “laws”, <i>Wynberg</i> determined that one of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s pressing and substantial objectives was to allocate limited resources
    in a manner that optimizes the benefits of autism treatment.  Accordingly,
    limitations on the availability of autism programs cannot be said to bear
    no relation to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s objective.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants argue that wait lists and the alleged policy of mutual exclusivity
    amount to “discriminatory” laws because they offend the fundamental principle
    of equality.  This point is addressed in <i>R. v. Cornell</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
    461 at 478, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that it would be redundant,
    in light of s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, to base equality claims on s.
    7. </p>
  <h3><i>Claims against the school boards</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the motion judge erred in striking claims against the
    school boards when that relief was not sought by the school boards except
    in terms of the standard basket provision asking the court for such relief
    as the court deems just.  However, in my view, when the motion judge struck
    claims against Ontario, it was open to him to strike the identical claims
    against the school boards where there was nothing to distinguish the impugned
    actions of the boards from those of Ontario. </p>
  <h3>Result</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would dismiss the appeal, subject to varying the order below
    to strike the appellants’ age-based discrimination claim without leave to
    amend.  I would also strike the s. 15(1) and s. 1 claims based on disability
    discrimination in their entirety with leave to amend.  The claim for <i>Charter</i> damages
    based on government negligence should also be struck with leave to amend
    to plead concisely the basis for the remedy sought.  I would also give the
    appellants leave to amend their claim in negligence against the school boards
    regarding the operation of the programs.  The claims as amended may, of course,
    be subject to further challenge. </p>
  <h3>Costs</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    assume that, as below, the appropriate disposition is to make no order as
    to costs.  If the parties take a different position, they may make brief
    written submissions within thirty days of the release of these reasons.  </p>
