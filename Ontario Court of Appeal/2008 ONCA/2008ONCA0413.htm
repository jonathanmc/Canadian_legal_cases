    jury acquitted the respondent on a charge of second degree murder.  The Crown
    appeals submitting that the trial judge made two legal errors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the Crown argues that the trial judge erred in removing from the jury’s consideration
    the possibility that the respondent had adopted the whole of a statement
    made to the police by his cousin, Ray Williams, which statement incriminated
    the respondent in the alleged murder. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown argues that having permitted the respondent to adduce evidence
    of the deceased’s propensity for violence, the trial judge erred in refusing
    to permit the Crown to lead evidence of the respondent’s criminal record
    for violence.  The Crown goes on to argue that this error was compounded
    by the trial judge’s failure to adequately correct inflammatory remarks made
    by the respondent’s counsel in his closing address.</p>

  <h4> FACTS</h4>
  <h2>(a) The Death</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    deceased, John Dillon, was a drug debt collector.  He lived in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sarnia.  On Saturday, March 3, 2001, Dillon’s girlfriend, Kyla Greenbird,
    saw him in the morning and said that he did not return to her house around
    6:00 p.m. as expected.  Dillon was seen in a bar in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sarnia that evening.  He left the bar at about 1:15 a.m.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    4:23 a.m. on March 4, 2001, a 911 call was made from a pay phone in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sarnia advising that there was an unconscious person in bad shape in a white
    car at
    “Christina and Confed”.  The phone call was recorded.  At trial, a police
    officer was permitted to give voice identification evidence and testified
    that he believed the caller to be the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Police
    and ambulance went to the parking lot at the corner of Christina and Confederation
    Streets and found Dillon in the back seat of his car.  He was lying face
    down, his upper body “wedged” between the front and back seat.  It was obvious
    that he had suffered serious injuries:  there was a lot of blood, his breathing
    was laboured and gurgling and he was unconscious.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Dillon arrived at the trauma centre, he had a very low level of consciousness
    and was put on a ventilator.  He died five days later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown called extensive medical and pathological evidence with a view to establishing
    that Dillon’s death was caused by a severe beating.  The respondent did not
    call any evidence relating to the cause of Dillon’s death.  However, the
    respondent did mount a significant challenge to the adequacy of the medical
    treatment that Dillon received, taking the position that the medical treatment,
    not the beating, was the cause of death.  This issue – the cause of death – is
    not germane to the issues on this appeal other than to indicate that at trial,
    the respondent argued as one of his defences that there was no culpable homicide.  </p>
  <h2>(b) Ray Williams’ Statement</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    examining Dillon’s car, the police discovered the handprint of Ray Williams
    on the rear passenger window.  The print was in Dillon’s blood.  Ray Williams
    was charged with first degree murder.  He was arrested in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Florida in May 2001 and was extradited back to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    on August 9, 2001.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary evidence implicating the respondent in the beating of Dillon came
    from a videotaped statement made by Ray Williams to the police on August
    12, 2001.  The statement was long and detailed, over one hundred pages.  It
    was common ground at trial that the statement accurately recorded what Ray
    Williams had said to the police on August 12.  At trial, Ray Williams resiled
    from his statement to the police.  He said that in fact he had no real recollection
    of the events of March 3, 2001, which were described in the statement.  He
    said that he made the statement in the hope that he would be released on
    bail. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown successfully applied under s. 9(2) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 to cross-examine Ray Williams.  Following the Crown’s
    cross-examination, the trial judge admitted the statement into evidence as
    proof of the truth of its contents.  The videotaped statement was played
    for the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his statement, Ray Williams said that on March 3, 2001, he had gone to the
    house of Warren Williams, the respondent’s brother, to get some cocaine.  He
    said that the respondent was in the garage and he went to see him.  Warren
    Williams’ wife came to the garage and told them that Dillon and Warren Williams
    were arguing on the porch of the house.  The respondent grabbed a crow bar
    and Ray Williams picked up a carpenter’s hammer.  The respondent told Ray
    Williams to stay in the garage and he then snuck around the garage. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About
    two minutes later, Ray Williams ran over to the front of the house and saw
    Dillon lying on his stomach, motioning to get up.  Ray Williams hit him in
    the back with the hammer and when he was still moving, he hit him in the
    back of the head.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ray
    Williams left to return to the garage and as he turned back, the respondent
    was hitting Dillon on the head (about three more times) with the crow bar.  The
    respondent returned to the garage.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    five minutes, Ray Williams and the respondent tried to drag Dillon to his
    car.  The respondent told Ray Williams to go through the car to see if there
    was a gun.  Ray Williams volunteered to drive Dillon for medical attention.  The
    respondent and Warren Williams put Dillon in the backseat of the car.  Dillon
    was murmuring and breathing like he was unconscious.  Ray Williams saw the
    respondent “in the backseat with him [Dillon] again mutilating him”.  The
    respondent was using a hammer to hit Dillon’s feet or ankle area.  The respondent
    slammed the door on Dillon’s forearms.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    cross-examination by the respondent’s lawyer, Ray Williams repeated that
    he had no memory of the events of May 3 involving the respondent which were
    described in his statement to the police.  He said that he made the statement
    to protect other family members and a friend.  He also said he made the statement
    to protect himself and to help him get out of jail.  He said that he tried
    to minimize his own involvement in the events.  Further, he said that the
    police told him that if he did not help the police, the charge, which at
    this point was second degree murder, could be put back up to first degree
    murder.  According to Ray Williams, the police threatened to go after his
    girlfriend and Warren Williams’ wife, if Ray did not help them.  At one point,
    the police spoke of reducing the charge to manslaughter.  Ray Williams told
    the police that he would give a statement if he would get out on bail.  The
    police said they would talk to the Crown about helping if he gave a statement.  He
    testified that during the discussions with the police, they had supplied
    him with details of the investigation which he then used in the statement.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown called the many police officers who had dealt with Ray Williams from
    the time of his arrest in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida until he gave the statement.  The police denied that Ray Williams
    had been given details of the investigation or that they had made any promises
    or threats to him.  There was nothing in the police evidence to support any
    allegation that the police engaged in improper conduct or that they promised
    Ray Williams bail if he made a statement.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent’s primary defence at trial was an attack on the credibility and
    reliability of Ray Williams’ statement.  He argued that if the jury did not
    accept the truth of what Ray Williams said in his statement, there was no
    evidence that he was involved in the beating of Dillon. </p>

    January 15, 2002, both the respondent and Warren Williams (who was also charged
    with the murder of Dillon) were scheduled for court appearances.  The police
    set up a cell probe in the courthouse and recorded a conversation between
    them.  The trial judge permitted police officers to give evidence identifying
    the voices on the audiotape.  Portions of the conversation were admitted
    into evidence and played for the jury.</p>

    in the cell probe conversation.</p>

    his conversation with Warren Williams in the cell, the respondent made reference
    to Ray Williams’ statement and, in particular, to parts of that statement
    which implicated him in the beating of Dillon (see para. 25 above).  At one
    point in the conversation, the respondent said “I’m not disagreeing with
    anything he [Ray Williams] said”.  </p>

    way of a pre-trial motion, Crown counsel sought a ruling that the respondent
    had adopted Ray Williams’ entire statement as his own.  The Crown argued
    the entire statement should be admitted into evidence as proof of its contents.  </p>

    reviewing the transcript of the cell probe, the trial judge was not satisfied
    that the respondent had adopted the entire statement.  He pointed out that
    the statement was given over a period of five hours, with a few breaks, and
    that when transcribed, it was one hundred and one pages in length.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his ruling the trial judge went on to say, “there is no evidence from the
    cell conversations to indicate that the accused was concerned with, animated
    by, or had directed his mind to the very matters covered in all 101 pages
    beyond those parts of the statement which he remembers and which implicate
    him directly in the beating of John Dillon.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge pointed out that this was not an all or nothing issue. He indicated
    that evidence could be led about those parts of the statement which the accused
    referred to in the cell probe and that the jury could reasonably infer that
    he had accepted those parts of the statement as his own.  Thus, at that point,
    the statement was not admitted into evidence. </p>

    Ray Williams testified, he recanted, and the Crown was permitted to cross-examine
    him.  The entire statement was admitted for the truth of its contents pursuant
    to the <i>K.G.B.</i> exception to the hearsay rule:  <i>R. v. B.(K.G.)</i> (1993),
    79 C.C.C. (3d) 257.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his closing address, Crown counsel referred to the relevant passages in the
    cell probe conversation and said, “If this were all one big lie, a big frame
    up conspiracy orchestrated by the police, you would think Nicholas Williams
    [the respondent] might say something to his brother about Ray Williams being
    a liar, but the contrary is the case”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the initial charge, the trial judge said nothing about whether or not the
    respondent had adopted any of Ray Williams’
    statement during the cell probe conversation.  Defence counsel objected,
    in effect making two points.  First, he argued that the effect of the Crown’s
    submission was to suggest that the jury could find the respondent’s comment
    in the cell probe signified that he had adopted the entire statement.  Defence
    counsel asked the trial judge to clarify that the respondent’s comment did
    not amount to an adoption of the entire statement.  Second, he asked the
    trial judge to bring home to the jury that the respondent’s statement – “I’m
    not disagreeing with anything he said” – was referring only to Ray Williams’ involvement
    in the beating of Dillon, not his own.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response, the Crown said that he had not argued that the respondent’s statement
    in the cell amounted to an adoption by him of Ray Williams’ entire statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge recharged the jury on this issue.  It is that recharge that gives
    rise to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>And two other
    matters, the first is this, there is in the audiotape of the cell probe,
    this statement which is attributed to Nicholas Williams, “I’m not disagreeing
    with anything he said,” and in the context of the cell probe the reference
    there is to Junior, or Raymond Williams.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is not apparent
    on the basis of that sentence what he is “not disagreeing with.”  I tell
    you, therefore, that that statement by Nicholas Williams, if you should find
    it is Nicholas Williams, should not be used to place Nicholas Williams in
    the position that he has adopted as true, <i>all that is said</i> in the
    statement of Raymond Williams – that is the videotaped statement.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to note that the trial judge’s recharge addressed only the first
    of the two points raised by respondent’s counsel.  The trial judge did not
    direct the jury that the respondent’s adoption of Ray Williams’ statement
    referred only to Ray Williams’ involvement in the beating.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the Crown argues that having determined, correctly, in the pre-trial
    ruling that it was for the jury to decide which, if any, passages of Ray
    Williams’ statement the respondent adopted, the trial judge in his recharge
    improperly took from the jury the possibility of concluding that the respondent
    had adopted everything in Ray Williams’
    statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument.  To start, the Crown at trial did not argue
    that the respondent’s statement in the cell should be viewed as an adoption
    of the entire statement.  Indeed, as pointed out above, the Crown made that
    clear in response to defence counsel’s objection to the charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge had ruled on the Crown’s pre-trial motion that the respondent’s
    statement in the cell probe did not constitute an adoption of Ray Williams’ entire
    statement.  At trial, the Crown did not seek to lead further evidence to
    show that at the time of the cell probe conversation the respondent had in
    his possession the entirety of Ray Williams’ statement or that he was referring
    to the entire statement when he said, “I’m not disagreeing with anything
    he said”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    and perhaps more importantly, there is nothing in the recharge that prevented
    the jury from concluding that the respondent had adopted any specific parts
    of Ray Williams’ statement, in particular those parts which incriminated
    him.  Indeed, it is implicit in the recharge that it was open to the jury
    to find that the respondent had adopted some parts of Ray Williams’ statement.  The
    trial judge said only that the respondent’s statement should not be interpreted
    to mean that he had adopted <i>all that</i> Ray Williams had said. Given
    that in the cell probe conversation the respondent specifically referred
    to portions of the statement that incriminated him, the jury could not have
    been misled into thinking that it was not open to them to conclude that he
    adopted those portions of the statement.  There was little else in Ray Williams’ statement
    that would have been of much assistance to the Crown in proving its case
    against the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also argues that the jury should have been specifically told that it
    was entirely for them to decide whether any portion of the statement had
    been adopted by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    there would have been no harm in giving this instruction, I am satisfied
    that a fair reading of the charge and the recharge made it clear to the jury
    that they were responsible for deciding factual issues and that it was up
    to them to decide what portions, if any, of Ray Williams’ statement the respondent
    had adopted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(b) The Respondent’s Disposition Towards Violence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that having permitted the respondent to adduce evidence of
    the deceased Dillon’s propensity for violence, the trial judge erred in refusing
    to permit the Crown to lead evidence of the respondent’s criminal record
    for crimes of violence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, after Ray Williams’ statement had been admitted into evidence but
    before the Crown led the evidence relating to the cell probe conversation,
    the respondent’s counsel sought an order permitting him to cross-examine
    a Crown witness about the deceased’s criminal record for violent crimes and
    his reputation for violence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge refused the respondent’s counsel’s request on the basis that
    the evidence was not relevant to any of the matters that were then in issue
    at trial.  The respondent’s position at that point was limited to a defence
    that he was not involved in Dillon’s beating.  The propensity of the deceased
    for violence was irrelevant to this position.  At this point, there was no
    evidence to support a defence of self-defence if the respondent were to be
    found to have been involved in the beating.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the audiotape of the cell probe conversation was admitted, the respondent’s
    counsel renewed the motion to lead evidence of the deceased’s propensity
    for violence.  Although the primary position of the respondent remained the
    same – he was not involved in the beating of Dillon – the cell probe conversation
    provided some basis for a defence of self-defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge ruled that the respondent’s counsel could lead evidence of the
    deceased’s three convictions for assault causing bodily harm and his general
    reputation for violence as it had been set out in an affidavit in support
    of an application for a wiretap.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response to the trial judge’s ruling, Crown counsel sought leave to enter
    the respondent’s lengthy criminal record for violence arguing that without
    evidence of the accused’s violent background, the jury could be left with
    a distorted view of the facts as they related to self-defence (i.e. the deceased
    had a propensity for violence and the respondent did not).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the ruling that the Crown challenges on this appeal, the trial judge refused
    the Crown’s request to introduce the respondent’s criminal record.  The trial
    judge was concerned about the risk that despite instructions that he might
    give, the jury may be tempted to walk “the forbidden path”.  By this, the
    trial judge obviously meant that he was concerned that the jury might use
    the evidence of the respondent’s criminal record improperly to conclude that
    he had been involved in the beating of Dillon rather than confining its use
    to the issue of self-defence, should they be satisfied that he had been involved.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also indicated in his ruling that there was cogent evidence that “the
    accused is not without warts, so to speak”.  He referred to the fact that
    the jury was aware that the respondent had previously been in jail and that
    if they accepted Ray Williams’ statement, the respondent had been involved
    in the violent events of March 4, 2001 leading to Dillon’s death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge’s reasons for this ruling are brief, it is apparent that
    he refused the Crown’s application to introduce the respondent’s record because
    he considered that if he admitted the evidence, the potential prejudice to
    a fair trial outweighed the probative value of the evidence to the only issue
    on which it would be relevant – self-defence.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally
    the Crown is not permitted to adduce evidence of an accused’s prior bad acts
    as circumstantial proof of conduct because of the potential for a trier of
    fact to rely improperly on the evidence:  <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002), 164
    C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at para. 37 (S.C.C.).  However, in some cases, courts
    recognize that an issue may arise in a trial to which evidence of an accused’s
    previous misconduct is so highly relevant and cogent that its probative value
    outweighs any potential for prejudice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    an accused relies on self-defence and leads evidence that the deceased was
    a violent person, the question of whether the Crown may lead reply evidence
    of the accused’s propensity for violence arises.  The Crown will be permitted
    to do so where it is necessary to enhance fairness and ensure that the trier
    of fact has a balanced, not a distorted, picture of what occurred between
    the deceased and the accused and of their respective dispositions for aggression.  See <i>R.

    decision whether to admit evidence of an accused’s prior bad acts is subject
    to a trial judge’s overall assessment as to whether the probative value of
    the evidence outweighs the potential prejudicial effect:  <i>R. v. Sparkes</i> at
    paras. 7-8.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    judge conducting a trial with a jury is in a preferred position to an appellate
    court in assessing the significance of evidence and the impact that evidence
    may have on the jury.  I say this both with respect to assessing the probative
    weight that a jury may attach to a particular piece of evidence and the prejudicial
    effect that its introduction may have on the fairness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike
    an appellate court, a trial judge has the opportunity to hear all of the
    evidence directly and to evaluate the impression or impact the evidence may
    have on a jury.  A trial judge hears and sees the witnesses at the same time
    as the jury.  A trial judge can observe firsthand the dynamics of a trial
    and the way the evidence is unfolding and can take steps to maintain balance
    and fairness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    of a trial judge’s preferred position in making these types of decisions,
    appellate courts will only interfere if there has been a manifest error or
    a decision is viewed as being unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, I see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s decision.  It
    was a close call but the trial judge did not base the decision upon improper
    factors nor was the decision unreasonable.  There are three points which
    lead me to this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the evidence that the trial judge permitted the defence to lead about Dillon’s
    propensity for violence did not add much to the evidence about him that the
    Crown had already introduced.  Thus, the need to balance any resulting unfairness
    to the Crown was not great.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the point in the trial when the defence was permitted to lead evidence about
    Dillon’s propensity for violence, the Crown had already introduced evidence
    that he collected money for drug debts, that he was pulling “a heavy” on
    Warren Williams, that he had beaten up people on the First Nations reserve,
    that in the past, he had threatened police officers’
    families, that he might carry a gun and that he may have associated with
    bikers.  The evidence also showed that Dillon was an enormous man physically,
    over six feet tall and approximately 270 pounds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the Crown’s evidence, it would have been open to the defence to argue that
    Dillon was a man with a propensity for violence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant
    to the trial judge’s ruling, the defence was permitted to elicit additional
    evidence about Dillon’s violent reputation during the cross-examination of
    Sergeant Oram.  That evidence, however, was brief – one paragraph from a
    wiretap affidavit – and added very little to what was already in evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the defence was allowed to lead evidence through Sergeant Oram
    of Dillon’s three convictions for assault causing bodily harm.  This was
    new information for the jury.  However, two of those convictions were in
    1983, eighteen years before Dillon’s death.  The other was in 1995.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    rationale for permitting the Crown to lead evidence about an accused’s disposition
    to violence in a self-defence case is founded on the need to balance the
    picture because the defence has been allowed to call similar evidence about
    the victim.  However, that rationale does not extend to the situation where
    the Crown leads evidence of the propensity of a victim towards violence.  In
    that circumstance, it is open to the defence to rely on the Crown’s evidence
    without opening the door to the Crown to call similar evidence about the
    accused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    in this case the trial judge’s ruling added little to what was already in
    evidence, the need to balance the scales to ensure a fair trial process was
    diminished significantly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second factor that supports the trial judge’s ruling is that there was already
    some evidence of the respondent’s bad character in the record.  As the trial
    judge pointed out, during the cell probe conversation, the respondent mentioned
    that he had previously been in jail.  In addition, in his statement to the
    police, Ray Williams described the respondent as “tough” and having a “reputation”.  He
    said, “you know not to F- with” the respondent.  This was not a case where
    if the Crown were not permitted to lead evidence of the respondent’s criminal
    record for violent offences, the jurors would likely mistakenly conclude
    that the respondent was a person with an unblemished character.  Thus, the
    need for the Crown to call the evidence to prevent a distorted picture was
    further attenuated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is important to keep in mind that the accused’s record, if admitted, was
    only relevant to the defence of self-defence, which was very much a secondary
    issue at trial.  The central factual issue in the case was the reliability
    and credibility of Ray Williams’ statement to the police.  If the jury accepted
    that statement, the case against the respondent was very strong.  While it
    is possible that the jury could have accepted Ray Williams’
    statement and still have acquitted the respondent on the basis of self-defence,
    that seems most unlikely.  Not surprisingly, the main argument of the defence
    at trial was that the jury should reject Ray Williams’ statement.  The defence
    took the position that without that evidence the jury could not convict.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    refusing the Crown’s request to call evidence about the respondent’s criminal
    record, the trial judge referred to his concern that the jury might use the
    evidence to walk “the forbidden path”.  The trial judge was obviously concerned
    about the danger that the introduction of the accused’s criminal record could
    arouse the jury’s emotions of prejudice or hostility towards the respondent
    or that the jury might use the evidence as an indication of propensity with
    respect to the main issue in the trial and not confine its use to the issue
    of self-defence.  In my view, this was a proper consideration for the trial
    judge in determining whether he should admit the evidence of the accused’s
    criminal record.  See <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at
    390-91 (S.C.C.). </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I am satisfied that this court should not interfere with the trial
    judge’s ruling to exclude the evidence of the respondent’s criminal record
    for crimes of violence.  </p>
  <h2>(c) Defence Counsel’s Closing Address</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that during his closing address, defence counsel crossed the
    line from vigorous advocacy to improper and inflammatory comments.  The Crown
    further submits that despite the Crown’s objections at trial, the trial judge
    failed to correct the damage done by the improper closing address.  The Crown
    fairly concedes, however, that the closing address might not, alone, be sufficient
    to warrant granting a retrial.  The Crown suggests, nonetheless, that it
    is of sufficient concern to deserve scrutiny and comment by this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    the latitude given to a defence counsel in closing, I agree with the Crown
    that defence counsel in this case (not counsel on this appeal) made inappropriate
    comments during his closing address.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most
    seriously, defence counsel repeatedly emphasized that the respondent was
    aboriginal and that the deceased was white, even though there was no evidence
    that race and racism were relevant to the events that led to Dillon’s death.  Early
    in his address, counsel said, “there is an important fact for you to consider
    here, and that is race and status play a major role in this case:  the race
    of the accused and the status of the decedent”.  He went on to refer to the
    fact that the deceased was a violent gangster but that he was white and that
    his client was native.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    when discussing the issue of self-defence, counsel again inserted the issue
    of race saying:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, I don’t
    know if it’s being suggested that a native person doesn’t have the right
    to defend their home against a home invader, and I certainly hope not, but
    the fact of the matter is that if any of you were put in that situation where
    a drunken debt collector for the Hell’s Angels comes raging to your house
    you would have the right to fight them, to keep them out.  Why can’t a native
    person have the same right?  They do.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was not a case about race.  There was no evidence suggesting that any of
    the events involved in the killing were racially motivated.  Nor was there
    any suggestion that a different standard of self-defence ought to apply to
    an aboriginal offender.  In these circumstances, it was wrong to import the
    theme of racism into the submissions relating to what led to Dillon’s death.  Raising
    an issue such as racism, when it is not supported by any evidence, could
    distract a jury from focusing on the evidence and issues that are relevant
    to the case.  In addition, doing so could trigger emotions, prejudices or
    sympathies of some jurors that should play no part in their deliberations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, during his closing address, defence counsel made several references
    to matters that were not in evidence.  That too overstepped the permissible
    parameters for a closing address.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is worth repeating the words of Austin J.A. in <i>R. v. Munroe</i> (1995),
    96 C.C.C. (3d) 431 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 383 (S.C.C.).:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While the prosecution
    of criminal charges is conducted on an adversary basis, the function of Crown
    counsel, <i>like defence counsel</i>, is to restrict himself or herself to
    the offence charged and to evidence properly before the court in that regard.  It
    is clearly improper to range further afield with a view to inflaming the
    passions of the jury with material that is obviously irrelevant to the specific
    case or with language that is calculated not to enlighten but to ignite.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was acquitted by a jury.  When seeking to overturn a jury’s verdict
    of acquittal, the Crown bears a heavy onus.  The Crown must satisfy the court
    that “the verdict would not necessarily have been the same” if the error
    complained of had not been made:  <i>R. v. V</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>zeau </i>(1976),
    28 C.C.C. (2d) 81 at 87 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this appeal, the Crown did not press the point that defence counsel’s inappropriate
    comments, taken by themselves, were sufficient to discharge the heavy onus
    necessary to set aside a jury verdict of acquittal.  While defence counsel’s
    comments ought not to have been made, I am not satisfied that this court
    should interfere with the verdict.  </p>
