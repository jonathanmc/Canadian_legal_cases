    Edwards was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, wear a disguise with
    intent and uttering threats contrary to sections 273, 351(2) and 264.1 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge declined
    to impose a dangerous offender designation sought by the Crown.  Instead
    the trial judge found Edwards to be a long-term offender and sentenced him
    to fifteen years in custody consecutive to the prison term he was then serving
    to be followed by a ten-year long-term supervision order. </p>

    the time of trial on the predicate offences, Edwards was serving a fifteen
    year sentence (less credit given for pre-trial detention on a 1.5 for 1 basis)
    for sex based offences against four women committed in 1991.  The predicate
    offences involved a violent assault in the course of which Edwards vaginally
    raped the victim ejaculating inside of her.  The predicate offences were
    committed in 1991, before commission of the offences for which Edwards was
    imprisoned.  The trial was not held until 2004 because Edwards was not identified

    its application to have Edwards declared a dangerous offender, the Crown
    called two psychiatrists, Dr. Klassen and Dr. Glancy.  They gave expert evidence
    opining that Edwards suffered from a coercive sexual paraphilia, a form of
    core deviant sexual preference, and was likely to re-offend.  Dr. Glancy
    was also of the opinion that the appellant’s offence pattern revealed a possible
    diagnosis of sexual sadism.  Klassen testified that Edwards “may present
    with a ‘reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community’,
    should the substantial [proportion] of the following decade be dealt [with]
    by means of a fixed sentence, and a substantial [proportion ] of the following
    decade be dealt [with] by means of a Long-Term Offender designation.”  This
    view was premised on the fact that Edwards, forty-two years old at the time
    of sentencing, would be over fifty years old after completing a ten year
    fixed term sentence.  </p>

    Dr. Klassen and Dr. Glancy testified that after the age of fifty there was
    an age-related decline in risk that Edwards would violently or sexually reoffend.  That
    risk would decline to very low levels after the age of sixty.  Edwards will
    be fifty-seven years old after serving the fifteen year fixed term portion
    of the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>

      Crown submits that the trial judge erred in relying exclusively on psychiatric
      evidence that indicated that individuals are substantially less likely
      to engage in violent sexual behaviour beyond a given age.  The Crown argues
      that this general tendency was based on group data.  There was no evidence
      specific to this particular offender to support the conclusion that the
      general tendency applied to Edwards and that, as a result, there was a
      reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community such that a
      long-term offender designation was appropriate.  As such, the Crown submits
      that the court should continue to consider Edwards to be at a serious risk
      of reoffending.</span></p>

      Crown notes that there were significant uncertainties in the diagnosis
      of Edwards.  The opinions of the psychiatrists had to be considered provisional
      given the absence of important information about Edwards.  Specifically,
      the trial judge noted that “[t]he question of whether Edwards is a sexual
      sadist and precisely what this portends in relation to the likelihood of
      recidivism, regardless of age, would be of great assistance to the court
      in deciding whether this is a case for an indeterminate sentence or a long-term
      designation with its unique sentencing provisions.”</span></p>

      Crown argues that because Edwards would not allow himself to be interviewed
      or treated by Dr. Klassen or Dr. Glancy, the concerns as to whether Edwards
      could be classified as a sexual sadist and whether he would be amenable
      to treatment were not fully explored.  By exercising his discretion to
      declare Edwards a long-term offender notwithstanding the absence of important
      information required to make such a decision, the trial judge impermissibly
      shifted the onus onto the Crown to demonstrate why the offender ought not
      to have been subject to an indeterminate period of incarceration.</span></p>

      my view, the Crown’s appeal should fail.  The trial judge was well aware
      of the difficulty of applying statistical evidence regarding age-related
      decline in risk of reoffending by sexual offenders to a specific individual
      such as Edwards.  Further, the trial judge did not, as alleged by the Crown,
      rely exclusively on the statistical evidence of age-related decline in
      reaching his conclusion.  The trial judge also had the benefit of the extensive
      reports filed by Dr. Klassen and Dr. Glancy, as well as reports from the
      institution where Edwards has been incarcerated for over a decade.  These
      reports indicated that Edwards had attended two sex offender treatment
      programs.  From the second program, it was reported that Edwards had shown
      some progress with respect to developing insight into his offence cycle
      and formulating a realistic relapse prevention plan.</span></p>

      raised and found that, with his advanced years upon release and appropriate
      parole conditions, there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control

      reaching this conclusion, the trial judge did not, in my view, improperly

      the offender liable to a sentence of imprisonment for life.  A fifteen

      Once the trial judge concluded that Edwards met the criteria of a dangerous
      offender, a designation to that effect and a sentence of detention for
      an indeterminate period would normally follow.  However, before actually
      designating Edwards as a dangerous offender, the trial judge had to decide
      whether to exercise his discretion not to make a designation (see <i>R.
      v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309 at 338 &amp; 362), and consider whether
      the less restrictive sanction of a determinate sentence and long-term offender

      these provisions he reasoned that, for there to be a reasonable possibility
      of eventual control of the risk in the community, Edwards would have to
      attain a certain age before being released into the community.  The trial
      judge had before him expert testimony regarding the age-related decline
      in risk for sex offenders and, weighing this evidence, concluded that a
      fixed-term sentence of fifteen years, combined with a long-term offender
      designation was necessary to address the concern that Edwards had a significant
      risk of reoffending.</span></p>

    “totality principle” has little relevance to the fashioning of an appropriate
    sentence in this case.  The “totality principle” is concerned with ensuring
    that, in the aggregate, a sentence is just and appropriate.  The principle
    is designed to ensure that the sentence imposed is in keeping with the record
    and prospects of the offender and does not impose on the offender what is

      dangerous offender/long-term offender sentencing regime is a “specialized

      of our communities: <i>R. v. Payne </i>(2001), 41 C.R. (5th) 156 at para.
      83 (Ont. S.C.J.).  In <i>R. v. Lyons</i> at 328, the Supreme Court affirmed

      the protection of the public.  The view expressed in

    Forest J. explained that preventive detention under the dangerous offender
    regime goes beyond what is justified on a “just desserts” rationale based
    on the reasoning that <i>in a given case, the nature of the crime and the
    circumstances of the offender call for the elevation of the goal of protection
    of the public over the other purposes of sentencing</i>.  La

    Forest J. confirmed, at p. 339, that the legislation was designed “to carefully
    define a very small group of offenders whose personal characteristics and
    particular circumstances militate strenuously in favour of preventive incarceration”.  [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>

      in sentencing the appellant, the trial judge’s paramount concern must have
      been to design a sentence that complied with the goal of public protection;
      this concern was elevated above the concern captured within the “totality
      principle”.  With the objective of public interest in mind, the trial judge
      was faced with the choice of either: (1) a dangerous offender designation
      coupled with an indeterminate sentence, or (2) a long-term offender designation
      coupled with a determinate sentence that offered
    “a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.”  Based
    on the evidence presented, the trial judge adopted the second option.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the recognition of the appellant’s advanced age upon release and the imposition
    of appropriate conditions during the supervision period were the main reasons
    for the trial judge’s decision to impose the long-term offender designation
    over the dangerous offender designation.  Application of the
    “totality principle” in isolation would likely have resulted in a shorter
    sentence that would not have allowed these specific conditions to develop.  In
    my view, the “totality principle” cannot be applied to require that a trial
    judge impose a fixed-term sentence that is shorter than the sentence judged
    necessary to meet the requirements for a long-term offender designation.  </p>

    addition, the circumstances of this case were such that, if the trial judge
    had concluded that the “totality principle” required the imposition of a
    determinate sentence of a shorter duration, the trial judge would have been
    limited to imposing a dangerous offender sentence (again, because the conditions
    underlying the trial judge’s decision to impose a long-term offender sentence
    could not have been satisfied).  <span lang=EN-US>As a result, the imposition
    of a fixed-term sentence at what might be considered to be the high end of
    the range for the predicate offences became the least restrictive sentence
    for this offender.  The sentence enabled the trial judge to make the long-term
    offender designation rather than the dangerous offender designation that
    would have resulted in a sentence of detention for an indeterminate period.</span></p>
