    a trial, the appellant was found guilty of one count of trafficking in a
    substance held out to be cocaine and sentenced to 38 months imprisonment in
    addition to credit of four months for pre-trial custody.  The appellant appeals from both his
    conviction and sentence.</span></p>

    respect to conviction the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    assessing the evidence of the key Crown witness, Chantal Demers, in that he
    referred to her as an independent witness, relied on her demeanor in court, and
    did not give her evidence the scrutiny it deserved in light of her admission
    that that she lied about half the time depending on to whom she was talking.  The position of the defence at trial was that
    Ms. Demers was lying in order to protect her friend Mr. Polsky who had
    delivered the substance which turned out to be morphine and resulted in the
    victim becoming comatose and suffering permanent mental and physical
    impairment. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    evidence of Ms. Demers was not contradicted by any defence evidence.  A critical part of her evidence, that the
    victim had called the appellant to obtain cocaine, was supported by objective
    evidence, namely, cell phone records.  The trial judge’s comment that Ms. Demers had distanced herself is
    supported by the fact that, following these tragic events, she moved from
    <st1:PlaceName

    Sturgeon

    Falls
    to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Barrie.  The suggestion that Ms. Demers was lying to
    protect her friend Mr. Polsky is undercut by the fact that prior to trial Mr.
    Polsky had pled guilty to one count of possession of a narcotic and been
    sentenced.  Accordingly, we are not
    persuaded that the trial judge erred in his assessment of Ms. Demers’ evidence
    and in convicting the appellant.  The
    appeal as to conviction is dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    to sentence, counsel submits that the trial judge erred in principle in not
    giving appropriate effect to the appellant’s house arrest while he was on bail
    for two years awaiting trial and in offending the principle of parity in
    sentencing the appellant to a sentence considerably longer than that of Mr.
    Polsky who effected the actual sale.  Mr.
    Polsky’s sentence reflects the fact that from the outset he admitted his
    involvement in the transaction and thereafter continued to cooperate with the
    police in the investigation.  His cooperation
    is no doubt reflected in the Court’s acceptance of a plea of guilty to a lesser
    offence.  These factors and the fact that
    Mr. Polsky is apparently a first offender no doubt gave rise to the discounted
    sentence he was given.  The reasons of
    the trial judge do not reflect any consideration of the bail conditions and
    although this may have constituted an error in principle, in the end, having
    regard to the appellant’s extensive criminal record, it is immaterial.  In our view, the sentence is fit.  Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</span></p>
