  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellant
    appeals both conviction and sentence. He was convicted after a trial of 4
    offences, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy to traffic,
    trafficking and possession of proceeds of crime. He was sentenced to 6 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The basis of
    the conviction appeal is that the Vietnamese interpreter did not fully and
    accurately translate the testimony of the appellant or the questions that were
    asked of him and that the cumulative effect of the errors deprived the
    appellant of his Charter right to make full answer and defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For the
    purposes of the appeal, the appellant retained another Vietnamese interpreter
    to review the recording of the evidence and to provide another translation. He
    provided the court with the excerpts where the second interpreter says that
    errors were made. We have reviewed those excerpts in light of the reasons for
    judgment and are satisfied that whether viewed individually or cumulatively,
    the errors are minor in nature and would not have affected the verdict or the
    appellant’s ability to make full answer and defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      We therefore
    dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The sentence
    appeal is based on the submission that the trial judge erred in her application
    of the parity principle to the sentences imposed on the appellant and his co-accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    co-accused pled guilty to one count of possession for the purpose of
    trafficking in front of another judge following a preliminary hearing and
    received a sentence of 4 years. Both men were involved in a conspiracy to
    distribute large quantities of marijuana that they received from
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia. They
    were observed receiving the drugs and transporting them in smaller quantities
    and were found in possession of over one million dollars. The trial judge found
    that both men were equally culpable in the enterprise. She concluded that the
    correct range of sentence for the offences is between 5 and 8 years, and that
    the appropriate sentence for the appellant is 6 years. She referred to the
    principle of parity and concluded that the principle was respected in this case
    because the co-accused pled guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In our view,
    the effective discount for pleading guilty in this case of two years on a six
    year sentence is certainly at the high end, especially where the plea was not
    made at the earliest opportunity and the Crown’s case was very strong. However,
    we cannot say that the trial judge made an error that would allow this court to
    interfere with a sentence, a matter on which this court accords substantial
    deference to trial judges. We also note that the appellant received a sentence
    of 4 years on the possession for the purpose count, while the 6 year sentence
    was imposed for the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In the
    result, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
