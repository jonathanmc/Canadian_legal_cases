    November 2002, Orillia Power was carrying out a long-term project that included
    stringing new electrical circuits along
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Memorial Avenue. Installation of the circuits involved the use of spider
    ropes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spider
    ropes are non-conductors, made of hollow, braided, lightweight rope that
    linemen attach to travellers and use to pull the conductors through from
    one pole to the next. Four spider ropes were in use as the project continued
    from the pole on the east side of the Memorial Avenue overpass above Highway
    11 to the next pole on the west side of the overpass and highway.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donald
    Westgarth was the foreman on the project, which included two journey- men
    linemen and two traffic control supervisors. Westgarth and the linemen each
    had more than 20 years experience in hydro-electrical installations. The
    crew had worked on the overpass portion of the project for three months.</p>
  <h3>3.         The Security Measures on November 6, 2002</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Orillia Power crew were working on the north side of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Memorial Avenue on the east side of Highway 11 when they decided to take
    their lunch break shortly before noon on November 6, 2002. Everyone took
    lunch together. No one remained at the job site.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    secure the spider ropes strung to the poles on the east side of the overpass,
    the crew pulled the ropes from the east to the west side of the overpass,
    but did not string them to the pole on the  west side. The loose end of each
    spider rope was secured by tying the end with a bowline knot, wrapping it
    around a guardrail post at its base, passing a four-inch shackle through
    each knot, and securing each knot with a tightened, threaded bolt. The end
    of each rope was taped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lunch break lasted one hour.</p>
  <h3>4.         Tampering on November 6, 2002</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lynda
    Garratt looked back towards the overpass after she had stopped her car in
    the northbound lane. She noticed a rope dangling from above the overpass
    after it had dislodged from her driver’s side rear-view mirror. She also
    noticed a man on the overpass winding up the rope. The man was standing near
    a yellow truck. Orillia Power’s trucks are blue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Donald Westgarth and his crew returned to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Memorial Avenue overpass after lunch, they noticed that one of the four spider
    ropes had sagged into the spans east of the bridge. The end of the rope lay
    on the ground on the east side of the northbound lanes of Highway 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donald
    Westgarth concluded that the spider rope had ended up on Highway 11 because
    someone, a stranger, had tampered with the mechanism used by Orillia Power
    employees to secure the spider ropes to a guardrail post while the crew was
    at lunch. Mr. Westgarth explained that someone had unthreaded or loosened
    the bolt in the shackle and allowed the rope to run through the security
    mechanism and fall freely to the road surface.</p>

  <h3>6.         Industry Standards and Other Methods of Security</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orillia
    Power is a member of the Electrical Utilities Safety Association of Ontario
    (<i>EUSA</i>). <i>EUSA</i>, in consultation with members of the Municipal
    Electric Association and the Provincial Labour-Management Safety Committee,
    has compiled a book of safety rules to express the minimum requirements for
    employee and public safety. The rules are promulgated to prevent accidents,
    personal injury and property damage, and are issued as a requirement of the <i>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    126 deals with the conduct of work and personal safety. It provides, in part,
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    safe work environment shall be established and maintained at all work sites
    to prevent injury to the general public and damage to property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    working on private or public property, precautions shall be taken to prevent
    injury to the general public or damage to property and equipment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>EUSA</i> Rule
    Book says nothing about how employees of utilities are to secure spider ropes
    when employees are absent from an installation site.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donald
    Westgarth explained that the only knot recognized in the electrical utilities
    industry for dead-ending purposes is the bowline knot. The bowline is a simple
    knot for forming a non-slipping loop at the end of a rope.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    party adduced any evidence about industry standards, if there are any, for
    securing spider ropes in circumstances such as those here. No evidence was
    given about methods more appropriate than what was used here. Suggestions
    put to Orillia Power employees who testified at trial included the use of
    a bucket truck or other means to tie off the ropes on a utility pole out
    of reach of a pedestrian. Donald Westgarth rejected the bucket truck and
    tieback suggestion as too risky.</p>
  <h3>7.         The Method Used to Secure the Spider Ropes</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Donald
    Westgarth explained that the method used to secure the spider ropes when
    he and the rest of the crew left for lunch took into account the prospect
    of tampering. The bowline knot is an industry standard to guard against slippage.
    The area in which the ropes were secured has a high frequency of vehicular
    traffic, thus decreasing the likelihood of tampering. The installation was
    put in place for a short time, in broad daylight, in an area where there
    was no pedestrian traffic. There were risks associated with other methods
    for securing the ropes.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        THE FINDINGS OF THE
      TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge gave judgment first on the issue of liability. About four months
      later, she released her reasons on causation and damages. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1.         The Findings on Liability</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that had Orillia Power employees used some alternative
    means of securing the spider ropes, neither tampering, nor the accident would
    have occurred. The other methods posited by the trial judge included tying
    the ropes off to another pole at a height inaccessible from ground level,
    tightening the shackle with a wrench, installing a locking system on the
    ropes to make tampering more difficult or leaving a flagman at the job site
    over lunch to ensure security. The method chosen did not meet the minimum
    standards described in the Rule Book of <i>EUSA</i>, Orillia Power’s “own
    association”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Orillia Power owed a duty of care to Ms. Garratt and
    fellow users of Highway 11. She described this duty in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19]     In order to establish a duty of care there
    must be forseeability and proximity. The defendant must take reasonable care
    to avoid acts or omissions which it can reasonably foresee would be likely
    to injure another party. There must be a sufficiently close relationship
    between the parties so that, in the reasonable contemplation of the defendant,
    carelessness on its part might cause damage to that person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     The test for proximity is a relatively
    low threshold. In order to establish a prima facie duty of care, it must
    be shown that a relationship of proximity existed between the parties such
    that it was reasonably foreseeable that a careless act could result in injury
    to the other party (<i>Ryan v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Victoria (City) et al </i>168 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>). Highway 11 is a busy
    highway. The defendant knew to secure the ropes so they would be away from
    the highway. They however left the four ropes attached to a low guardrail
    easily accessible to a
    “tamperer”. Other options were available to make them secure. I find that
    it was reasonably foreseeable that a careless act on the part of the defendant
    could result in injury to a driver on Highway 11 and that a careless act
    occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge turned next to the standard of care. The essentials of her finding
    on this issue appear in paragraph [21] of her reasons in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The standard of care must be appropriate
    in the circumstances, and is that of the ordinary, reasonable, cautious and
    prudent person in the position of the defendant. The defendant is a power
    distribution company. Conduct is negligent if it creates an objectively unreasonable
    risk of harm [<i>Ryan v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Victoria (City)</i>]. The factors to be considered by a reasonable person
    when deciding upon a course of conduct include: the likelihood that its conduct
    will injure others, the seriousness of the injury if it happens, balanced
    against the interest which must be sacrificed to avoid the risk (<i>Klar,
    Tort Law, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed. </i>(

    prompted her reaction, the immediate cause of her injuries. The respondent
    was driving her car on a public highway, an ordinary and well-known activity

    who owes a duty of care to another to take such care as would have been reasonable
    in the circumstances. And what is reasonable depends on the facts of each
    case. The conduct that directly caused the harm to the respondent in this

    appellant contends that the task of the trial judge was to determine whether
    the appellant took reasonable care in all the circumstances. In particular,
    the trial judge was required to decide whether the acts of vandalism were
    reasonably foreseeable. Instead, the trial judge decided that the appellant
    was negligent by imposing a standard of strict liability. The appellant failed
    to comply with what the trial judge regarded, in the absence of evidence,
    as industry standards. Other steps could and should have been taken to better
    secure the installation. The appellant failed to do so. The respondent suffered
    damages. Therefore, the appellant was negligent.</p>

    care to ensure that events like those that occurred here would not happen.
    The appellant did not do all that was required to satisfy the relevant standard
    of care. Even if the appellant complied with the accepted industry standard,
    compliance is of no legal moment if the industry standard is itself inadequate.</p>

    the circumstances. The evidence of the appellant’s employees about never
    having encountered an incident of vandalism was relevant to, but not dispositive
    of the issue the trial judge had to decide. Also relevant was evidence that
    other precautions could have been taken to further reduce, if not eliminate
    the risk of vandalism. The finding made by the trial judge was reasonably

    such a duty is found to exist, what next requires decision is whether the
    appellant exercised the standard of care necessary to avoid breaching that
    duty. A discussion of duty focuses upon its existence. The standard of care

      In <i>Ryan</i>, Major J. described the standard of care an alleged tortfeasor
      must exercise to avoid liability. He described that standard in these terms
      in paragraph 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… To avoid liability, a person must exercise the
    standard of care that would be expected of an ordinary, reasonable and prudent
    person in the same circumstances. The measure of what is reasonable depends
    on the facts of each case, including the likelihood of a known or foreseeable
    harm, the gravity of that harm, and the burden or cost which would be incurred
    to prevent the injury. In addition, one may look to external indicators of
    reasonable conduct, such as custom, industry practice, and statutory or regulatory
    standards. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge made two errors in determining that the appellant
    breached the standard of care. First, she appears to have found liability
    because, in her view, the appellant’s conduct did not meet its own “industry
    standard”. In other words, the path to liability proceeded directly from
    a failure to meet the “industry standard” to a finding of negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    difficulty with this approach is that there was no evidence of an industry
    standard for security of spider ropes when a work crew is absent from a job
    site. The trial judge seems to have relied upon the very general instruction
    in the EUSA rule book, which directs utilities to take precautions to avoid
    injury and requires supervisors to take measures, reasonable in the circumstances,
    to ensure the safety of the workplace and the public. That direction, however,
    is nothing more than a statement of the legal requirements for the standard
    of care at common law. It falls far short of establishing an industry standard
    upon which to found liability in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second error that the trial judge made was to treat an industry standard,
    if there was one, as dispositive of a breach of the standard of care. That
    is wrong in principle because it amounts to a finding of negligence based
    on strict liability and treats what is, at best, some evidence of negligence
    as conclusive proof of it. As Major J. said in <i>Ryan</i>, industry practice
    and statutory and regulatory standards are external indicators to which one
    can look in assessing whether there has been a breach of the standard of
    care. They are not in themselves determinative of that issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that I have found that the trial judge erred, it falls to this court to determine
    whether on this record, the respondent has established that the appellant
    breached the applicable standard of care. In my view, there is no evidence
    that the actions of the appellant’s employees fell below what was reasonable
    in the circumstances. The harm to the respondents was directly caused by
    an independent human agency, the vandal on the overpass. The appellant’s
    conduct would fall below the reasonable standard of care if, but only if,
    its conduct created an objectively foreseeable risk of harm by a third party.
    In other words, unless the intervening conduct was reasonably foreseeable,
    the appellant is not responsible for the intervening acts of the third party:  <i>2
    Remedies in Tort</i> (Klar <i>et al.</i>) § 189.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    decide whether the appellant utility’s conduct created an objectively unreasonable
    risk of harm, it is essential to remember that the direct cause of the harm  was
    the conduct of a third party, the vandal who released the rope from its mooring.
    It thus becomes necessary to consider whether the intervening conduct of
    the vandal was a reasonably foreseeable result of the appellant’s allegedly
    negligent conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Smith
      v. Littlewoods Organisation Ltd.</i>, [1987] A.C. 241 (H.L.), Littlewoods<i> </i>purchased
      a cinema, which the company planned to close, demolish and replace with
      a supermarket. The cinema premises were secured when it ceased to operate
      as a cinema. As the weeks went by, however, the security in the main building
      was breached. Trespassers regularly entered. Debris accumulated outside
      the building. Passers-by noticed that trespassers had attempted to start
      fires inside and adjacent to the cinema. No one informed Littlewoods<i> </i>or
      the police about these observations. About a month after Littlewoods had
      taken possession, someone started a fire inside the cinema. The fire damaged
      two adjoining properties. The owners of those properties sued Littlewoods
      alleging negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    adjoining property owners’ success at trial was short-lived. The Court of
    Session allowed Littlewoods’ appeal. The owners appealed to the House of
    Lords where they argued that it was reasonably foreseeable that children
    would be attracted to the unsecured cinema, gain entry and cause damage to
    it. It was reasonably foreseeable that the damage would include damage by
    fire which, it was (further) reasonably foreseeable, would, in its turn,
    spread to and damage adjoining properties.</p>

    House of Lords dismissed the property owners’
    appeal. Lord Mackay, with whom three other members of the House agreed, described
    the duty of care towards a person injured by the conduct of a third party
    in these terms at p. 261:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…[W] here the only possible source of the type
    of damage or injury which is in question is agency of a human being for whom
    the person against whom the claim is made has no responsibility, it may <i>not
    be easy to find that as a reasonable person he was bound to anticipate that
    type of damage as a consequence of his act or omission. The more unpredictable
    the conduct in question, the less easy to affirm that any particular result
    from it is probable and in many circumstances the only way in which a judge
    could properly be persuaded to come to the conclusion</i> that the result
    was not only possible but reasonably foreseeable as probable would be to
    convince him that, in the circumstances, it was highly likely. In this type
    of case a finding that the reasonable man should have anticipated the consequence
    of human action as just probable may not be a very frequent option. Unless
    the judge can be satisfied that the result of the human action is highly
    probable or very likely he may have to conclude that all that the reasonable
    man could say was that it was a mere possibility. Unless the needle that
    measures the probability of a particular result flowing from the conduct
    of a human agent is near the top of the scale it may be hard to conclude
    that it has risen sufficiently from the bottom to create the duty reasonably
    to foresee it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In summary I conclude, in agreement
    with both counsel, that what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a
    case involving injury or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases
    where such agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own
    act or omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required

    this case, the act of mischief by the unknown vandal occurred in broad daylight,
    immediately beside a public roadway, on a highway overpass frequently travelled
    by vehicles but rarely, if at all, by pedestrians. The project, of which
    the installation above the overpass was an integral part, had been ongoing
    for several months without any acts of vandalism at any stage or location. </p>

    to the evidence adduced at trial, the method of security used in this case
    had been used by the utility for several years without incident. The method
    selected took into account the unlikely prospect of vandalism or other interference
    in the short time the crew would be absent from the work site. While other
    methods of rope security may have reduced the risk of trespassory interference,
    nothing indicated the possibility, let alone the likelihood of such interference.
    There was evidence that some other methods of security were less safe for
    the workmen, less practical and not indicated in the circumstances.</p>

    thorough canvass of the trial record yields no evidence capable of sustaining
    a finding that the vandalous acts that directly caused the respondent’s damages
    were reasonably foreseeable from the appellant’s conduct in securing the
    spider ropes. Accordingly, in my view, the respondent has failed to establish
    that the appellant breached the applicable standard of care. In the result,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and dismiss the action
