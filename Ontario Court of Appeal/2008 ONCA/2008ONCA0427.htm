    appeal concerns an attempt by a plaintiff to relitigate the facts underlying
    an acquittal for sexual assault.  The motion judge, Lederer J., granted a
    motion by the defendant hospital under r. 21.01(3)(d) and dismissed the action
    as an abuse of process.  The motion judge made this order because he interpreted
    the reasons of the judge in the criminal case as expressing a finding that
    the sexual assault did not occur, rather than merely expressing a reasonable
    doubt.  The plaintiff appeals against the order dismissing its action.  The
    defendant hospital cross-appeals the motion judge’s cost orders.</p>

    Hospital.  Mrs.&nbsp;Polgrain was severely disabled and entirely dependent
    on the nurses and staff of the hospital.  The defendant Peter Cocchio was
    a nurse at the hospital and assigned the care of patients in the intensive
    care unit.  Two employees of the hospital believed that they witnessed Mrs.
    Polgrain being sexually assaulted by Mr. Cocchio on two separate occasions
    in June 2000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 17, a nurse named Pamela Rogers was assigned to care for Mrs. Polgrain.  She
    testified that a few minutes after she had attended to Mrs.&nbsp;Polgrain
    she noticed that the door to her patient’s room was shut.  She decided to
    investigate and found Mr. Cocchio with his back to the door and his groin
    near Mrs.&nbsp;Polgrain’s head.  Mrs. Polgrain’s body and the bed had been
    repositioned.  Ms.&nbsp;Rogers approached Mr. Cocchio and asked for an explanation.  He
    said that he was trying to make her more comfortable and had also given her
    more sedation.  Ms. Rogers noticed that there was a small blanket over Mrs.
    Polgrain’s eyes and that Mr. Cocchio was pulling up the zipper to his pants.  There
    was no medical reason for the patient’s eyes to be covered and no reason
    to reposition the patient.  Further, in her view, Mrs. Polgrain should not
    have been given additional sedation in light of a scheduled procedure later
    that day.  Ms. Rogers also noticed a fluid on a towel which she believed
    to be semen.  She took a sample of the fluid to the laboratory but the lab
    technician did not detect any sperm when the fluid was examined under a microscope.  While
    Mr. Cocchio was the cover nurse for Mrs. Polgrain’s room, according to Ms.
    Rogers there was no reason for him to be in the room at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence concerning the second count of sexual assault was given by a respiratory
    therapist, Jill Aucoin, who testified to an event on June 27.  While the
    details were somewhat different, again there was no apparent reason for Mr.
    Cocchio’s actions in relation to the patient and the patient’s eyes were
    covered by a towel.  The witness noticed Mr. Cocchio adjusting his pants
    and she believed he was putting his penis back into his pants.  Mr. Cocchio
    had no assignment to Mrs. Polgrain’s room on that day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the employees reported their concerns to superiors, nothing was done by the
    hospital until a police investigation into Mr. Cocchio in relation to a second
    patient.  Mr. Cocchio was subsequently charged with three counts of sexual
    assault: two of the counts related to Mrs. Polgrain and the third to another
    female patient.  Mrs. Polgrain had passed away before the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only matter in dispute at the criminal trial was whether the assaults took
    place.  There was no question of identity or that the patients were incapable
    of consenting.  Mr. Cocchio testified at the trial.  He denied sexually assaulting
    the patients and while he had no specific recollection of the events of June
    17 and 27, he explained what he would have been doing in Mrs. Polgrain’s
    room.</p>

    of all charges.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS IN THE CRIMINAL CASE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal turns on the reasons given by the trial judge in the criminal case.  Those
    reasons are lengthy and appear to constitute a thorough review of the evidence
    adduced at the trial.  However, for the purpose of this appeal I need only
    set out a few of the key passages that were relied upon by the respondent.  In
    short, it was the position of the respondent that the trial judge acquitted
    Mr. Cocchio not simply because he had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt;
    rather, he found on a balance of probabilities that the sexual assaults did
    not occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was very critical of several of the key Crown witnesses.  For
    example, he found that Ms. Rogers was prone to exaggeration and selective
    in her recollection of events.  He did not trust some of her evidence unless
    it was confirmed by other independent evidence.  He observed that several
    of the hospital witnesses “fell short of totally honouring” their oath to
    testify truthfully.  He did not trust Ms. Roger’s evidence about the blanket
    being over Mrs. Polgrain’s eyes and he did not believe Ms. Aucoin’s testimony
    that she had observed a sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt at length with the identification of the fluid collected
    by Ms. Rogers.  He was convinced that the fluid was not Mr. Cocchio’s semen.  He
    considered Mr. Cocchio to be a sincere witness who gave reasonable explanations
    for his conduct.  He was satisfied that there were many reasons why Mr. Cocchio
    would have been in the patient’s room.  While only counts 1 and 2 relate
    to Mrs. Polgrain, the trial judge stated as follows in concluding Mr. Cocchio
    should be acquitted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The question
    is, then, does the circumstantial evidence allow for a conclusion beyond
    a reasonable doubt that Mr. Cocchio did this, or is the court left with nothing
    more than guesswork or speculation?  <i>The answer is an emphatic no.  The
    evidence, I find, fails completely to prove the guilt of Mr. Cocchio.  </i>Indeed,
    the evidence of the prosecution failed to allow for any meaningful degree
    of anything<i> other than the merest of speculation.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the end
    I am satisfied that on the totality of the evidence, not only is Mr. Cocchio
    not guilty of Counts 1 and 2, what Ms. Rogers and Ms. Aucoin believe they
    saw is simply wrong.  <i>The evidence reveals this to be the case, and thus,
    Mr. Cocchio’s innocence</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>As with
    Counts 1 and 2, not only do I find that the Crown has not proved Mr. Cocchio’s
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>Rather, I find that the totality of
    the evidence, once again, proves Mr.Cocchio’s innocence</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge addressed the Polgrain family and Mr. Cocchio.  He advised
    the family to believe that Mr. Cocchio “did not [sexually] assault your mother
    and loved one”.  He told Mr. Cocchio: “You should leave here and accept that
    you have been exonerated.”</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      CIVIL ACTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    of Mrs. Polgrain’s daughters, the executor of her estate, commenced an action
    on behalf of the estate in July 2001 against the hospital and Mr. Cocchio.  The
    claim against Mr. Cocchio is for sexual assault, battery and breach of fiduciary
    duty.  The claim against the hospital is for vicarious liability for the
    actions of Mr. Cocchio, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, occupier’s
    liability, breach of non-delegable duty arising from the hospital’s failure
    to ensure the safety of the patient and negligence in failure of the hospital
    to properly investigate and report the incidents to the police and regulatory
    bodies.  Mr. Cocchio has not defended the action and was noted in default.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      MOTION JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge gave careful and thoughtful reasons.  He relied principally
    upon the <i>C.U.P.E.</i> decision in finding that the action against the
    hospital was an abuse of process.  The motion judge was aware that ordinarily
    an acquittal in a criminal case is not a bar to a subsequent civil case founded
    on the same facts, because of the different burdens of proof.  But, in this
    case, the trial judge had made findings on a balance of probabilities.  In
    his view, at para 30, it would be “an abuse of process to allow the relitigation
    of the determination made by LaForme J. that the assaults did not occur.  The
    evidence he heard was complete, his analysis was comprehensive and his finding
    certain.”  The motion judge was of the view that the appellant
    “cannot escape the glaring reality” that it was attempting to relitigate
    the question of whether the sexual assaults occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge interpreted <i>C.U.P.E.</i> as requiring protection of the integrity
    of the adjudicative process and that this may require the court to examine
    the reasons behind the disposition by a criminal court.  The motion judge
    rejected the appellant’s submission that new evidence in the form of expert
    evidence about nursing standards could be adduced at the civil trial and
    could lead to a different result.  He noted that the issue of nursing standards
    was not new and such expert evidence would have been available at the time
    of the criminal trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded at para. 53 by stating that this was an unusual and
    perhaps unique situation since it is rare for a judge to be able to make “the
    certain, unambiguous and conclusive findings” that the trial judge made in
    this case.  He was of the view that it was “unlikely that this will happen
    soon again”.</p>

    case turns upon the application of the abuse of process doctrine to prevent

    denied committing the offence but was convicted and his conviction was affirmed
    on appeal.  A few days after the conviction, the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto fired the employee.  The employee grieved the dismissal.  The parties
    to the grievance were his union and the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Following a hearing at which the employee testified and again denied
    committing the offence, the arbitrator held that the employee had been dismissed
    without just cause.  In effect, the arbitrator found that the employee had
    not committed the sexual assault.  An application by the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto for judicial review was allowed and the finding of the arbitrator
    set aside.  That holding was upheld by this court in reasons reported at
    (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 541 and then by the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>

    reasons of the Supreme Court on the issue of abuse of process were written
    by Arbour J.  She considered three doctrines that could prevent the relitigation
    of the conviction in the grievance proceedings: (1) issue estoppel, (2) collateral
    attack, and (3) abuse of process.  She concluded that the better approach
    was through the doctrine of abuse of process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasoning that led her to that approach applies equally to this case.  Issue
    estoppel does not apply because the parties are not the same.  In this case,
    neither the appellant nor the respondent hospital had been parties to the
    criminal proceeding.  The doctrine against collateral attack also does not
    apply because the appellant does not seek to overturn the acquittal.  The
    appellant, as it must, accepts the acquittal; but it says that because of
    the different burdens of proof it is entitled to attempt to establish on
    a balance of probabilities that Mrs. Polgrain was sexually assaulted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core principle which the abuse of process doctrine seeks to vindicate is
    to prevent the use of the court process in a way that would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute.  Relitigation of a claim that a court has already
    determined may bring the administration of justice into disrepute by violating “such
    principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of
    the administration of justice”: <i>C.U.P.E.</i> at para. 37.  As such, abuse
    of process focuses “less on the interest of parties and more on the integrity
    of judicial decision making as a branch of the administration of justice”: <i>C.U.P.E.</i> at
    para. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the respondent hospital submits that permitting the appellant
    to relitigate the sexual assault in the civil proceeding engages the integrity
    of judicial decision making.  It submits that the civil action attempts to
    impeach a judicial finding through relitigation in a different forum.  It
    relies in particular on the comments by Arbour J. in <i>C.U.P.E.</i> at para.
    51.  In that passage, Arbour J. points out the practical problems with relitigation.  First,
    there can be no assumption that relitigation will lead to a more accurate
    result.  Second, if the same result is reached, the relitigation has been
    a waste of judicial resources, an unnecessary expense for the parties and
    additional hardship for witnesses.  Third, if the result is different, the
    inconsistency will undermine the credibility of the entire judicial process
    “thereby diminishing its authority, its credibility and its aim of finality”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily,
    relitigation in a civil forum of the facts underlying an acquittal does not
    engage these concerns because of the different burdens of proof.  A finding
    in the civil case that the defendant probably committed the criminal act
    of which he or she was acquitted does not undermine the credibility of a
    system that found there was a reasonable doubt.  Thus, it is not a question
    of whether relitigation has led to a more accurate result; the system contemplates
    that different results are possible because of the different burdens of proof.  If
    the same result is reached in the subsequent civil proceeding, it may be
    argued that there has been a waste of judicial resources, expense to the
    parties that might have been avoided and hardship to the parties and witnesses.  However,
    this is a tolerable consequence because of other competing principles, in
    particular access to the courts to pursue legitimate claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, however, the respondent submits that relitigation would undermine
    the integrity of the judicial process because of the judicial findings made
    in the criminal case.  It submits that the trial judge found as a fact that
    the sexual assault did not occur; the reasons disclose that the judge did
    not merely have a reasonable doubt but that he was of the view that the offence
    probably did not occur.  Thus, to allow the appellant to now relitigate that
    finding would threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    hospital also submits that none of the factors that favour relitigation apply.  In <i>C.U.P.E.</i> at
    para. 52, Arbour J. listed three circumstances where relitigation may be
    necessary to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the adjudicative
    process.  They are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>(1)
      when the first proceeding is tainted by fraud or dishonesty; (2) when fresh,
      new evidence, previously unavailable, conclusively impeaches the original
      results; or (3) when fairness dictates that the original result should
      not be binding in the new context.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    hospital submits that the criminal trial was obviously not tainted by fraud
    or dishonesty.  While the appellant claims to have additional evidence in
    the form of expert opinions about nursing standards, that evidence was available
    and could have been called by the Crown and in any event is far from conclusive.  Finally,
    the hospital submits that fairness does not require relitigation.  At para.
    53, Arbour J. discussed fairness in the context of relitigation.  In some
    circumstances, preventing relitigation would create unfairness, such as where
    the stakes in the original proceeding were too minor to generate a full and
    robust response.  That was not the case here; both the Crown and the defence
    had every reason to prosecute and defend the case as vigorously as possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with many of the hospital’s submissions.  In particular, I accept that
    the factors favouring relitigation as enunciated in <i>C.U.P.E.</i> do not
    apply.  The criminal trial was not tainted by fraud or dishonesty. The proposed
    additional evidence is neither fresh nor conclusive, as there was some evidence
    at the criminal trial about nursing standards from the nurse witnesses.  Further,
    the case did not really turn on nursing standards but on the credibility
    and reliability of the eye-witnesses and of Mr. Cocchio.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also of the view that the reasons of the trial judge are reasonably open
    to the interpretation that he did not simply have a reasonable doubt.  Rather,
    he was satisfied, at least on a balance of probabilities, that there was
    no sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    if unfairness is fully defined by the question of whether the party had a
    sufficient incentive to defend or prosecute the case then there was no unfairness.
    In my view, however, unfairness encompasses additional dimensions.  I am
    also of the view that in considering the broader question of the integrity
    of the judicial process there are other policy interests that are important.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>(2)  Policy Considerations </b></p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    start with the other dimensions of unfairness.  A concern in this case is
    that there is no way for the appellant, or any other party to the litigation,
    to review the judicial findings upon which the hospital relies.  An appeal
    is against the verdict, not the reasons for the verdict.  The only part played
    by the reasons is that they may disclose an error in reasoning that taints
    the lawfulness of the verdict.  That the trial judge went further than he
    had to and found not simply a reasonable doubt but that the sexual assaults
    did not occur was not a ground for an appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the core principles underlying the abuse of process doctrine in the relitigation
    context is that judicial findings are final and binding and conclusive unless
    set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed.  It is therefore significant that
    there may be no way for any of the parties to appeal additional findings
    made by a trial judge in a criminal matter.  The appellant obviously had
    no right to appeal the result of the criminal trial.  But more importantly,
    not even the Crown, who was a party to the criminal proceeding, had a right
    of appeal against the trial judge’s reasons.  It could only appeal against
    the verdict.  Even if the Crown was of the view that the trial judge erred
    in his findings of fact, unless those findings tainted the validity of the
    verdict the Crown could not successfully appeal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    question of availability of review and the concept of appeal from the verdict
    rather than the reasons is not simply a matter of semantics or the idiosyncratic
    nature of criminal appeals.  It goes to the essential nature of the criminal
    trial and what constitutes a judicial finding in that context.  Barring unusual
    circumstances where a finding may have to be made on a balance of probabilities,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the judicial finding to be made by the criminal
    court is whether the case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  That
    burden of proof is the touchstone of the criminal trial and is the lens through
    which the facts are viewed and findings made.  Any findings by the trial
    judge must be understood in that context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as this court explained in <i>R. v. Mullins-Johnson</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d)
    425, an acquittal of a wrongfully convicted individual re-establishes the
    accused’s legal innocence but does not address factual innocence.  In delivering
    reasons for judgment, a trial judge may express in clear and strong terms
    the reasons for the acquittal.  The trial judge in this case and the court
    of appeal in <i>Mullins-Johnson </i>did so but the criminal court cannot
    make a formal legal declaration of an accused’s factual innocence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in my view, the reasons of the trial judge in acquitting Mr. Cocchio are
    not judicial findings that attract the same relitigation concerns as does
    the formal verdict.  To dismiss this suit as an abuse of process would attribute
    to the reasons of the trial judge a declaration of innocence, a verdict that
    was not legally open in the criminal proceedings.  Again, this is not a matter
    of semantics.  There are important policy reasons for not recognizing a verdict
    of factual innocence.  As was explained in <i>Mullins-Johnson</i> at para.
    25, the most compelling is the impact on other persons found not guilty:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>As
      Professor Kent Roach observed in a report he prepared for the <i>Commission
      of Inquiry into Certain Aspects of the Trial and Conviction of James Driskell</i>, </span>“<span lang=EN>there
      is a genuine concern that determinations and declarations of wrongful convictions
      could degrade the meaning of the not guilty verdict” (p. 39). To recognize
      a third verdict in the criminal trial process would, in effect, create
      two classes of people: those found to be factually innocent and those who
      benefited from the presumption of innocence and the high standard of proof
      beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also concerned about the impact on the integrity of the judicial process
    in another sense.  In applying the abuse of process or issue estoppel doctrines
    a court will be required on occasion to review the reasons for conviction
    to determine the matters in issue and the essential findings: see <i>Trang
    v. Edmonton Remand Center</i> (2002), 322 A.R. 212 (Q.B.).  But where the
    accused is acquitted, the only essential finding is simply that the case
    was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge may arrive at
    that conclusion for any number of reasons.  For example, in a sexual assault
    trial there may be a reasonable doubt that the complainant consented, that
    the act occurred, that the accused was the perpetrator or that the touching
    was of a sexual nature.  It is not essential that the trial judge find as
    a fact that there was consent, that the act did not occur, that the accused
    was not the perpetrator or that the touching was not of a sexual nature.  It
    is enough that the trial judge had a reasonable doubt on one or more of those
    features of the case.  The judge is not required and it is not essential
    that the judge make a positive finding in the accused’s favour on any of
    those issues.  To give full legal significance for abuse of process purposes
    to matters that were not essential to the decision would confuse the roles
    of the criminal and civil courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I would not want to interpret or apply the abuse of process doctrine in a
    way that would interfere with the wide discretion given to judges for the
    manner in which they express their reasons.  Trial judges in criminal cases
    should feel free, as did LaForme J. in this case and as did this court in <i>Mullins-Johnson</i>,
    to express their reasons for acquittal in the manner they consider appropriate.  They
    ought to be able to call the facts as they see them and express their reasons
    in a way that may give the parties solace, satisfaction or even vindication.  </p>
