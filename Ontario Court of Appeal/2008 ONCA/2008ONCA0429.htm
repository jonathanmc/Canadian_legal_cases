    case concerns provincial offence tickets and what happens when a person who
    is served with one does nothing. The case raises both a substantive and a
    procedural issue.  The substantive issue is whether the “set fine” must be
    accurately indicated on a provincial certificate of offence in order to allow
    a justice of the peace to enter a conviction rather than quash the proceeding
    under s. 9(1) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.33, when the person charged has not responded to the offence notice.
    The procedural issue is the correct route for the prosecuting authority to
    challenge a decision by a justice of the peace to quash a proceeding under
    s. 9(1): whether by appeal under s. 135(1) of the Act, or by application
    for a prerogative remedy under s. 140 of the Act.</p>

    April 10, 2006 and April 15, 2006, each of the sixteen respondents to this
    appeal was charged with a provincial offence under Part I of the Act. These
    offences included driving offences such as speeding, failing to yield, and
    driving without a license, as well as by-law infractions such as making noise
    in the street and causing a disturbance.  In each case, a carbon copy ticket
    form was completed by a provincial offences officer. The top copy of the
    form is the certificate of offence. The second copy is the offence notice.
    Two other copies are marked for administrative and record-keeping purposes.
    The contents of each copy of the form are the same.  They contain boxes for
    the officer to fill in the name of the officer, the name and address of the
    person charged, vehicle and license information, the address where the offence
    occurred, the nature of the offence, the statutory provision that governs
    the offence and the amount of the set fine.  They also contain information
    for the person charged about options for responding to the offence notice,
    including default judgment if no response is made within fifteen days.</p>

    describe the mode of procedure under Part&nbsp;I as less serious than laying
    an information under Part III: <i>The 2007 Annotated Ontario Provincial Offences
    Act</i> at p. 30. Where a certificate of offence is used, service can be
    effected in one of two ways: either with an offence notice or a summons.
    When an offence notice is used, the defendant has several out-of-court options
    for resolving the charges, including default pursuant to s. 9(1). However,
    when a summons is used, the defendant is required to appear and these out-of-court
    options are not available.</p>

    is no evidence in the record as to why the officers in these sixteen cases

    the $5 service cost to the prescribed set fine amount in accordance with

    and victim surcharge is correct despite the set fine amount itself being
    incorrect, although the parties do not agree on how many cases are correct.

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes three arguments in support of the proposition that the certificates
    at issue should not have been quashed. The first is that the proper approach
    to be taken by a justice when reviewing a certificate of offence under s.
    9(1) to determine whether it is “complete and regular on its face” is to
    correct any defect in substance or form, particularly technical deficiencies
    such as an error in the set fine amount, rather than quash the proceeding.
    The appellant points to sections of the Act<i> </i>that favour amendment
    of deficiencies rather than quashing of proceedings. For example, s. 34(1)
    allows the court “at any stage of a proceeding” to amend the information
    or certificate that is defective in substance or form in any way. The appellant
    also points to s. 36(2), which states that the court shall not quash an information
    or certificate unless an amendment “would fail to satisfy the ends of justice”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is clear that these sections were not intended to apply when
    a justice is exercising the special powers and procedure conferred by s.
    9(1) of the Act. The provisions cited by the appellant, ss. 34(1) and 36(2),
    are found in Part IV of the Act, titled “Trial and Sentencing”. Although
    the opening words of s. 34(1) state that “the court may <i>at any stage of
    the proceeding</i> amend …”
    [emphasis added], it is clear from reading the entire section that it is
    intended to apply in the context of a proceeding on an information or certificate
    that has moved forward to the hearing stage. Furthermore, s.&nbsp;36(2) must
    be read together with s. 36(1), which requires that an objection to an information
    or certificate for a defect on its face must be made by motion to quash,
    either before the defendant has entered a plea or after with leave of the
    court. Subsection (2) directs the court that it is in responding to such
    a motion that the court is to amend the information or certificate if possible
    rather than quash. This section does not apply to the s. 9(1) in-office default
    procedure, where there are no motions to quash made and no plea is taken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    distinction can be seen in this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Singh</i> (2004),
    9 M.V.R. (5th) 195. In that case, as the defendant had appeared to plead,
    s. 9(1) did not apply. The justice presiding at the hearing quashed the certificate
    because it contained an incorrect set fine. This court upheld the reviewing
    judge’s conclusion that the justice erred by failing to amend the certificate
    under s. 34(1), even though she would have been obliged to quash it under
    s. 9(1) had the defendant not appeared.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    remaining doubt about the intent of the legislature with regard to the proper
    interpretation and application of these sections is resolved by rule 15(1)
    of the <i>Rules in Provincial Offences Proceedings</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    200, as amended. This rule states that two matters can be dealt with only
    in a court hearing: quashing a proceeding, except under s. 9 and some other
    sections, and amending an information, certificate of offence, or certificate
    of parking infraction. This makes it clear that the legislature did not intend
    that a justice of the peace have the power to amend a defective certificate
    in a s. 9(1) default proceeding because such a proceeding takes place in-office,
    not in court.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second argument is based on s. 90(1), which is found in Part
    V of the Act, “General Provisions”. This section states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>90. (1) The
    validity of any proceeding is not affected by,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    warrant, offence notice, parking infraction notice, undertaking to appear

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    this section must be read and interpreted as a whole including subsection
    (2) which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>90. (2) Where
    it appears to the court that the defendant has been misled by any irregularity,
    defect or variance mentioned in subsection (1), the court may adjourn the
    hearing and may make such order as the court considers appropriate, including
    an order under section 60 for the payment of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection
    (2) makes it clear that s. 90 applies in the context of a hearing before
    the court, and therefore not where the justice is proceeding on default under
    s. 9(1) where no hearing is held. Furthermore, s. 90(1)(b) contemplates a
    comparison between the certificate and the offence notice, but the offence
    notice is not before the justice in a s. 9(1) proceeding. In any event, a
    defect in the set fine on the certificate would be identical to that on the
    notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s third argument is that this court should endorse the decision
    of the Superior Court of Justice in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>York</i><i> (
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType

    a motion brought by the prosecuting authority under s.&nbsp;140(1) of the
    Act to challenge the justice of the peace’s decision to quash a certificate
    under s. 9(1) because the set fine was incorrect. Boyko J. concluded that
    because s.&nbsp;3(2)(a) of the Act requires the set fine to be on the offence
    notice and no section requires it to be on the certificate, the set fine
    is not a component of the certificate that is required for it to be considered “complete
    and regular on its face”. Rather, she held that the amount of the set fine
    is mere surplusage. The court further held that where the set fine entered
    by the officer is incorrect, the justice is obliged to impose the correct
    set fine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the court specifically rejected the decision of
    the Ontario Court of Justice in <i>R. v. Khoshael</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 2110
    as wrong. In that decision, Libman J. succinctly discussed the special default
    procedure under s. 9.1 of the Act, which is identical to the procedure under
    s. 9(1), stating at paras. 8-13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Provincial
    Offences Act strikes a balance between inferring from the failure of defendants
    to act, such that they are taken to have waived their right to be presumed
    innocent and their right to a hearing, thereby consenting to a conviction,
    while placing an overriding requirement on the Justice, as the independent
    judicial officer put in place as a safeguard, the task of examining the charge
    document which has initiated the proceeding, so as to prevent injustices
    from occurring.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this light,
    the power of the Justice to refuse to enter a conviction and quash the proceeding
    where the ticket or charge document has not been delivered to the defendant
    in accordance with the Act, or where there are irregularities on its face
    such that it is not complete and regular, constitutes an integral part of
    this pervasive regime in respect of regulatory infractions. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Different considerations
    apply where the defendant appears at trial and the Act’s broad amendment
    powers under s. 34 may be invoked and the grounds for quashing are circumscribed
    by s. 36. Technical objections, it has been stated, ought not to impede an
    impartial trial on the merits, contrary to the spirit of the Act which requires
    courts to look at substance, and not procedural irregularities.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I see nothing
    inconsistent in the statement of principles which applies to the disposition
    of technical deficiencies arising in the course of the trial setting, as
    opposed to those in respect of the “default conviction” provisions under
    s. 9.1 of the Act. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Defects which
    arise in respect of the latter, that is, involving a certificate of offence
    or charge document which is the subject of examination under s. 9.1, go to
    the very jurisdiction of the Court to conduct a hearing in the defendant’s
    absence and enter a conviction, the defendant having been deemed not to dispute
    the charge. Hence, a premium is rightly placed on the form of the document,
    since matters of substance are not engaged by s. 9.1. The absence of an amendment
    power while providing for one of quashing under s. 9.1(3), whereas s. 36(2)
    provides for both powers at trial, confirms, in my respectful opinion, this
    distinction. [Citations omitted.]</p>

    J. acknowledged that not every irregularity will result in a quashing order.
    He referred to a recent case where the words “of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario” were not included in the reference to the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> as
    an example of words that were not necessary but mere surplusage. However,
    he concluded that the proper amount of the set fine was not mere surplusage,
    but rather, was necessary in order for the certificate to be complete and
    regular on its face.  It forms part of the basis used by the defendant to
    decide whether to default.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Wilson</i>. While it is true that s. 3(2)(a) of the <i>Act</i> only requires
    the set fine to be indicated on the offence notice and not on the certificate,
    this is because the certificate can be used in conjunction with either a
    summons or an offence notice.  When the officer completes the carbon copy
    ticket form, the top copy of which is the certificate of offence, the officer
    is required to fill in the box for the set fine and total payable when proceeding
    by way of offence notice, but not when proceeding by way of summons.  The
    certificate does not need to contain the set fine when a summons is used
    because the defendant does not have the option of defaulting. The defendant
    must appear for a hearing of the charge regardless of the amount of the set
    fine.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    where an offence notice is used, the set fine is required because the defendant
    needs that information in order to decide whether to default and be subject
    to the set fine, plus costs and the victim fine surcharge. That is why s.
    3(2)(a) does not require the certificate to indicate the set fine in all
    cases, but does require it when the officer chooses to proceed by way of
    offence notice.</p>

    the offence notice is served and no response is received from the defendant
    within fifteen days, the justice must examine the certificate under s. 9(1)
    in order to determine whether it is “complete and regular on its face”. In
    doing so, the justice is effectively determining whether the defendant received
    effective notice of all the information needed to decide whether to default.
    The set fine is one of those required pieces of information. As noted above,
    s. 3(2)(a) requires it to be included on the offence notice, which is a carbon
    copy of the certificate. Therefore, the set fine is also required to be on
    the certificate or else it can be inferred that it was not on the notice,

    decision in <i>R. v. Moore</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 289, in which the court
    held that a defective information would not be quashed as a nullity if it
    gave fair notice of the offence to the accused and the defect could be cured
    by amendment. For the reasons already discussed, the analysis in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    <i>Moore</i> can be applied to proceedings under the Act where the power
    to amend is provided, but is not of assistance in the context of the default
    procedure under s. 9(1) in which no amendment is allowed. That procedure
    does not require the certificate to be a nullity in order to be quashed as
    in a case under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, but only incomplete or irregular
    on its face.</p>

    other argument made by the intervenor is that the set fine does not affect
    the validity of a certificate because it is not an element of the offence.
    Rather, the intervenor argues that it is only relevant to sentencing. This
    position does not bear scrutiny when assessed in the context of the default
    procedure and the required notice to the defendant that that procedure entails.
    In the default context, the set fine is part of the information the defendant
    requires in order to decide whether to default and thereby forgo the right
    to be presumed innocent and to have a hearing.</p>

    conclude that the approach advocated by the appellant and the intervenor
    does not accord with the purpose or scheme of Part I of the Act, which is
    to facilitate an inexpensive and expeditious procedure for dealing with a
    large volume of less serious offences. The default procedure put in place
    by the Act<i> </i>is intended to be inexpensive and expeditious for defendants
    who wish to acknowledge the offence and pay the fine. This procedure also
    saves the cost to the government of holding trials in cases where people
    are content to be found guilty of a relatively minor offence and pay a disclosed
    set fine. However, the trade-off for these savings is that where the default
    procedure is used, the certificate of offence must be
    “complete and regular on its face”. If it does not comply, it cannot be amended
    and must be quashed.</p>

    colleague Doherty J.A. suggests that where the set fine is wrong on the offence
    notice (and the certificate), and where the person chooses to default and
    is convicted and a higher set fine is imposed, that person has the remedy
    of an appeal. However, in my view, this approach is inconsistent with the
    intent of the default procedure. First, it removes the incentive for peace
    officers to be accurate when completing the “set fine” on certificates of
    offence and places the burden of correcting an error on the citizen, rather
    than the state, whose error it is. Second, if the set fine is inaccurate
    on the offence notice, the notice will not comply with the requirements of
    s. 3(2)(a) of the Act, and an appeal would likely be successful, while the
    cost and time required for such appeals both for the citizen and the system
    would undermine the intent of the default procedure to be efficient and inexpensive.</p>

    an internal memorandum from the Office of the Chief Justice, Ontario Court

    for an order quashing the indictment as void for duplicity. The Crown brought
    a motion for <i>mandamus</i>. It was common ground that the Crown had no
    right of appeal. The majority of the Supreme Court held that <i>mandamus</i> was
    available because the Crown was seeking an order to proceed with the trial
    where no trial had been held. They held that the indictment was not duplicitous
    and granted the order for <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

    issue arose again in the Supreme Court but in the context of a summary conviction
    offence in <i>Cheyenne Realty Ltd. v. Thompson </i>(1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d)
    49. In that case, the appellant pled not guilty to a charge of breaching
    a city by-law, then moved for an order that the by-law was invalid. The trial
    judge agreed that the by-law was inoperative and held that the court had
    no jurisdiction to hear the matter. The respondent moved for <i>mandamus</i>.
    The Supreme Court distinguished <i>Kipp</i> on the basis that in that case,
    it was the form of the indictment that precluded the judge from proceeding,
    while in <i>Cheyenne</i>, the judge’s conclusion that the by-law was inoperative
    was a decision on the merits amounting to an acquittal. The judge effectively
    decided that there had been no breach of the by-law by the accused by deciding
    that there was no by-law to breach.  That finding amounted to a verdict of
    acquittal and therefore should have been appealed by way of stated case under
    s. 762 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provided for such an appeal in
    summary conviction matters.</p>

    issue of when the Crown may appeal by way of stated case under s. 762 rather
    than move for <i>mandamus</i> when an information is quashed was discussed
    by this court in <i>R. v. B &amp; B Stone Ltd.(No. 2)</i> (1977), 34 C.C.C.
    (2d) 464. In that case, the information was quashed for duplicity. Arnup
    J.A. explained that where an information is duplicitous, it is not void.  Therefore
    when it is quashed, it is not a declining of jurisdiction, but a decision
    that can be appealed. He further explained that cases such as <i>Kipp</i>,
    which dealt with motions to quash indictments rather than informations, had
    to be assessed differently because the right of appeal for indictments under
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> was quite different from s. 762 for summary conviction
    matters, and only allowed the Crown to appeal from “a judgment or verdict
    of acquittal of a trial court”.</p>

    ), the indictment was quashed for delay under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The Crown moved for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> in aid,
    quashing the order and directing the court to proceed with the hearing on
    the indictment. Martin J.A. first considered the propriety of the Crown proceeding
    by way of prerogative writ rather than appeal. He concluded that although
    the decision to quash the indictment under the <i>Charter</i> could have
    been appealed, that would not always preclude a resort to <i>mandamus</i>.
    He stated at p. 33: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It seems that
    the rule that <i>mandamus</i> cannot be invoked where an appeal lies is not
    so much an inflexible rule of law, as a rule regulating the discretion of

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case was an early <i>Charter </i>decision where new procedural issues were
    arising for determination in the <i>Charter </i>context.  In the end, the
    court held that <i>mandamus</i> was available in the circumstances, although
    an appeal would be the preferable remedy in similar circumstances in the
    future.<a href="#_ftn2"

    over when <i>mandamus</i> properly lies, Martin J.A  stated at p. 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is well established
    that where it is alleged that a trial judge has erroneously quashed an indictment
    for defects in the indictment such as duplicity, failure to allege a material
    averment and the like or on the ground of failure to comply with technical
    procedural requirements, no appeal lies from the order quashing the indictment.
    Such an order is not tantamount to an acquittal and does not preclude the
    preferring of another indictment. It has been authoritatively decided that
    where an indictment has been quashed for technical or procedural irregularities <i>mandamus</i> is
    the appropriate remedy to challenge that decision. The question to be decided
    on <i>mandamus</i> in those circumstances is not whether the trial judge
    had jurisdiction to quash the indictment, but whether he erred in law in
    quashing the indictment. </p>

      v. Jewitt</i> (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 7, the Supreme Court considered whether
      a judicially-entered stay of proceedings for entrapment was a “judgment
      or verdict of acquittal” for the purposes of an appeal under s. 605(1)(a)
      of the <i>Criminal Code.</i> After reviewing the case law, the court concluded
      at p. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>From this review,
    it can be concluded that quashing an indictment is tantamount to an acquittal
    where (a) the decision to quash is not based on defects in the indictment
    or technical procedural irregularities, and (b) the decision is a final decision
    resting on a question of law alone, such that if the accused were charged
    subsequently with the same offence he or she could plead <i>autrefois acquit</i>. </p>

line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinctions drawn in the case law discussed above, developed under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, must be considered in the context of the Act, and in particular,
    in the context of the default procedure under s. 9(1) and the specific appeal
    and prerogative remedy provisions of ss. 135(1) and 140.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 135(1), there is an appeal against acquittal, conviction, and sentence
    in a proceeding commenced under Part I. Had the legislature intended to allow
    the prosecuting authority or the Attorney General to appeal when a proceeding
    is quashed under s. 9(1), it could have specifically provided for an appeal
    in that event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    s. 9(1) accords with the jurisprudence under the <i>Criminal Code</i> regarding
    when a quashed proceeding is effectively an acquittal. By giving a justice
    the ability to quash but not to acquit, the legislature has made it clear
    that the decision to quash is not a verdict on the merits tantamount to an
    acquittal, but rather is a recognition that irregularities on the face of
    the certificate do not allow for default conviction. The legislature has
    made the decision to balance the use of the expeditious default procedure
    with the need to protect the integrity of the system by sacrificing convictions
    on default where the officer makes an error that affects the completeness
    or regularity of the certificate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it accords with the scheme of the Act that no regular avenue of
    appeal is provided where a proceeding is quashed under s. 9(1). The procedure
    established by s. 9(1) requires the justice to make a decision without the
    benefit of any input from either side. If the prosecuting authority or the
    Attorney General believe a justice has misconstrued what constitutes an error
    going to the regularity or completeness of the certificate, a prerogative
    remedy can be sought. However, one would expect such cases to be relatively
    rare.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    clear wording of ss. 135(1) and 9(1) also suggests that the legislature did
    not intend that courts proceed on the basis that a proceeding quashed under
    s. 9(1) is “tantamount to an acquittal”. This approach would effectively
    accord a right of appeal where the legislature chose not to provide one.
    It would also be inconsistent with the legislature’s decision not to give
    a justice the power to acquit under s. 9(1). In my view, based on the wording
    of the Act, as well as its intent to provide an efficient and cost-effective
    default procedure, expanding the right of appeal beyond what is specifically
    provided for in the Act would constitute an error in law.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I wish to address the issue that arises from the jurisprudence regarding
    whether a quashed certificate is a nullity or an irregularity. Traditionally,
    only a constating document that is a nullity deprives the court of jurisdiction
    to proceed based on that document. However, the default scheme under s. 9(1)
    of the Act is differently constructed: the jurisdiction accorded to a justice
    is to either convict or quash. The latter is within the justice’s jurisdiction
    where the certificate is incomplete or irregular on its face. Viewed another
    way, the incompleteness or irregularity deprives the justice of the ability
    to convict based on the certificate, and as discussed above, the justice
    has no authority under the Act<i> </i>to amend a defective certificate when
    proceeding under s. 9(1) following default. In that way, although the certificate
    is only incomplete or irregular on its face, it has the effect of a nullity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the nullity/irregularity distinction does not fit easily into
    the s. 9(1) default procedure. However, regardless of whether the irregular
    or incomplete certificate is a nullity or an irregularity, the Act does not
    provide for an appeal where the certificate is quashed.</p>

    would dismiss the appeal from the decision of the application judge. In my
    view, the prosecuting authority was correct in the procedure it followed
    to seek an order in the nature of <i>mandamus</i> in respect of the sixteen
    quashed certificates that are the subject of this appeal. However, the <i>mandamus</i> order
    should not be made because the justice of the peace was correct in finding
    that the errors in the set fines on the certificates constitute irregularities

    I of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (the “<i>Act</i>”)
    provides the process by which the most minor of provincial offences may be
    prosecuted.  Under that part, a person who receives an offence notice alleging
    he or she has committed a provincial offence, most typically a traffic violation,
    has several options.  The options are set out in full in the offence notice
    given to the defendant.  My colleague has summarized those options at para.
    15 of her reasons.  If the defendant chooses to do nothing, s. 9 is triggered:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

    9 provides that where at least fifteen days have elapsed since the defendant
    was served with the offence notice (usually the date of the offence) and
    the defendant has not taken any steps to avail himself or herself of any
    of the other options available, then that person is deemed “to not wish to
    dispute the charge”.  Where the deeming component of s. 9(1) takes effect,
    the justice has only two options.  If the certificate of offence before the
    justice is not “complete and regular on its face”, then the justice “shall
    quash the proceeding”:  s. 9(1)(b).  If the certificate is complete and regular,
    then the justice shall enter a conviction and impose the “set fine” for the
    offence:  s. 9(1)(a).</p>

    J.A. advances three reasons to support her conclusion that an error in the
    amount of the “set fine” shown on the certificate of offence requires the
    justice to quash the proceedings pursuant to s. 9(1)(b). First, she concludes
    (at paras. 27-28) that where a provincial offences officer chooses to proceed
    by way of offence notice rather than summons, s. 3(2) of the <i>Act</i> requires
    that the amount of the “set fine” appear on the certificate of offence.  It
    follows that a failure to put the correct amount on the certificate means
    that it is “not complete and regular on its face” and must be quashed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Feldman J.A. holds (at para. 29) that a justice acting under s. 9(1) is charged
    with the responsibility of:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[D]etermining
    whether the defendant received effective notice of all of the information
    needed to decide whether to default.  The set fine is one of those required

style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    observes that the error in the “set fine”
    amount on the certificate of offence will inevitably be repeated on the offence
    notice given to the defendant because the latter is a carbon copy of the
    former.  This error will deny the defendant information that he or she needs
    in deciding whether to appear and answer to the charge.    </p>

    Feldman J.A. reasons (at para. 31) that as there is no power to amend the
    certificate of offence under s. 9(1), a justice who enters a conviction must
    impose the set fine shown on the certificate.  However, if the amount is
    incorrect, the justice cannot impose that amount as the statute permits only
    the imposition of the statutorily prescribed “set fine” amount.  As the justice
    cannot convict and impose the wrong “set fine”, it follows that the justice
    must choose the only other option available under s. 9 and quash the proceedings.</p>

    certificate of offence is a charging document under Part I of the <i>Act</i>.  It
    is the equivalent of the information in a criminal proceeding.  Its purpose
    is to identify the charge made against the defendant.  Section 3 requires
    that the provincial offences officer certify that an offence has been committed.  The
    officer who issues the certificate shall also certify on the certificate
    that he or she personally served the offence notice on the date specified
    in the certification:  s. 3(5).  The certificate of offence must be filed
    as soon as practicable after service in the court office:  s. 4.  The defendant
    does not receive a copy of the certificate of offence.  </p>

    provincial offences officer who completes and signs a certificate of offence

    the allegation, his or her options, and the relevant court date.  </p>

    3(2)(a) specifically provides that an offence notice must indicate “the set
    fine for the offence”.  There is no such requirement for the certificate
    of offence.  This makes sense.  The certificate of offence goes to the court.  The
    court does not need to be told the set fine for the offence charged.  The
    offence notice goes to the defendant.  Clearly, it is potentially important
    for the defendant to know what penalty he or she faces should a conviction
    ensue.  The amount of the “set fine” is, therefore, required on the document

    to the court by the provincial offences officer.</p>

    disagree with Justice Feldman’s assertion at para. 28 that s. 3(2)(a) of
    the <i>Act</i> requires that the certificate of offence indicate the “set
    fine” amount where the officer chooses to proceed by way of offence notice
    but not where the officer chooses to issue a summons.  Nothing in s. 3(2)
    suggests that the contents of the certificate of offence will vary depending
    on whether the officer issues an offence notice or a summons.  Nor do the
    relevant forms suggest any difference in the content of the certificate of
    offence depending on the nature of the process issued.  My colleague has
    helpfully attached a copy of a certificate of offence to her reasons.  An
    examination of that form indicates that the same form is used regardless
    of whether the defendant is given an offence notice or a summons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    nothing in s. 3 requires that the “set fine” amount be included in the certificate
    of offence, the form to be used for a certificate of offence as required
    under the regulations contains a space in which the provincial offences officer
    is to indicate the “set fine” amount.  An examination of the forms reveals
    that they are designed so that the officer may fill out the certificate of
    offence and the offence notice at the same time.  The one is a carbon copy
    of the other.  Presumably, the aim is to reduce paperwork and minimize clerical
    errors by allowing the officer to fill out both forms at once.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    use of this format requires that each form provide a place for information
    that the statute requires be placed on either or both the certificate of
    offence or the offence notice.  For example, because the offence notice is
    a carbon copy of the certificate of offence, it will contain the provincial
    offence officer’s signature certifying that he or she personally served the
    offence notice on the defendant.  Section 3 of the <i>Act</i> does not require
    that proof of service appear on the offence notice.  No purpose is served
    by having proof of service on the offence notice.  However, proof of service
    on the certificate of offence is required by the statute, and because the
    forms are virtual carbon copies, the information pertaining to service appears
    on both the certificate of offence and the offence notice.  I think the same
    rationale explains why the
    “set fine” amount appears on the certificate of offence and the offence notice.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    physical design of the form offers further support for my conclusion.  The
    reference to the “set fine” amount on the certificate of offence appears
    below the fiat of the provincial offences officer certifying that the offence
    alleged in the certificate was committed and that the individual charged
    has been served with an offence notice.  The very form of the documents suggest
    to me that the amount of the “set fine” is not an integral part of the certificate
    of offence, but appears on the document as a matter of convenience to facilitate
    the officer’s ability to create both a certificate of offence and notice
    of offence at the same time.  Administrative convenience should not dictate
    the essential components of the certificate of offence.</p>

    since the defendant was served with the offence notice and if the defendant
    has not chosen any of the other options available to him, then pursuant to
    s. 9, the defendant is deemed “to not wish to dispute the charge”.  The section

    in s. 9 suggests to me that the justice should be concerned with whether
    the defendant has received notice of all information needed to decide whether
    he or she should respond to the charge.  The information that may be relevant
    to any particular defendant’s decision to appear in answer to the charge
    cannot possibly be known or identified by a justice on a s. 9 inquiry.  Section
    9(1)(b) is not designed to ensure that a defendant has made an informed decision
    not to appear.  It is designed to ensure that the defendant who does not
    appear has been served and that the certificate contains the information
    necessary for a proper allegation of an offence under the <i>Act</i>.  Section
    9(1)(b) protects against convictions for non-existent offences and convictions
    of persons not properly served with the offence notice, which of course is
    the document that brings the various options to the attention of the defendant.  </p>

    very limited inquiry mandated by s. 9(1)(b) has nothing to do with whether
    the defendant received effective notice of all the information needed by
    him to decide which of the available options he or she should choose.  I
    would add that even if the justice acting under s. 9 must determine whether
    the defendant made an informed decision not to dispute the charge, that rationale
    would only justify quashing certificates where the error in the “set fine” amount
    could have misled the defendant.  An error which understates the “set fine” by
    a few dollars, or overstates the “set fine” could not have any effect on
    a defendant’s decision not to dispute the charge.</p>

    agree with Feldman J.A. that a person convicted of an offence under Part
    I of the <i>Act</i> cannot be ordered to pay any fine other than the “set
    fine”.  If the provincial offence officer has put the wrong amount on the
    certificate of offence, whether the amount of higher or lower than the accurate
    amount, the defendant cannot be ordered to pay the incorrect amount.  I also
    agree with my colleague that a justice acting under s. 9 of the <i>Act</i> cannot

    would not, however, characterize the imposition of the correct “set fine” amount
    upon entering a conviction under s. 9 as an amendment to the certificate
    of offence.  The certificate of offence is the charging document.  It contains
    the allegation.  The justice has no power to amend that allegation under
    s. 9.  If, however, the justice enters a conviction under s. 9, then the
    justice moves to the question of sentence.  Section 9 commands the justice
    to “impose the set fine for the offence”.  When performing that function,
    the justice does not look to the contents of the certificate of offence but
    rather to the terms of the applicable statute.  A justice who convicts under
    s. 9 will impose the statutorily prescribed “set fine” amount.  There is
    no need for the justice to amend or alter the contents of the certificate
    of offence.  </p>

    I of the <i>Act</i> is designed to deal efficiently and inexpensively with
    the huge volume of minor regulatory offences that exist in this province.  It
    does so by providing various means by which cases may be resolved without

    process.  The <i>Act</i> puts the onus on the defendant to choose from among

    9 is one of the options available to a person charged under s. 1.  Where
    the defendant chooses to do nothing, thereby triggering s. 9, it is no part
    of the court’s concern under s. 9 whether that choice was a wise one or an
    informed one.  Nor should the court read requirements into the statute which
    introduce a technical pleadings-based
    “defence” into Part I proceedings.  By a pleadings-based defence, I mean
    one that has nothing to do with the merits of the allegation or any legitimate
    fairness concerns.  With respect to the contrary view, I think quashing a
    certificate of offence because of an error in the “set fine”
    introduces a technicality that is inconsistent with the overall philosophy
    of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>

    acknowledge that there can be cases where a mistake in the “set fine” amount
    found on the offence notice (the defendant does not see the certificate of
    offence) could prejudice a defendant.  For example, a person may chose not
    to defend a charge thinking the fine is $100, when in fact it is $400.  Differences
    between the amount shown on the offence notice and the actual “set fine” amount
    may be significant enough to cause defendants to choose options they would
    not otherwise choose. This potential prejudice can be addressed without the
    need to quash all charges where there is any error in the “set fine” amount,
    even an error that could not possibly have prejudiced the defendant.  </p>

    defendant who is convicted under s. 9 will receive a notice of the fine imposed

    amount noted on the offence notice, the defendant is entitled to appeal the
    conviction and sentence to the Ontario Court of Justice:  s. 135(1).  Presumably,
    if the defendant can convince the appeal court that he or she was materially
