    was considerable evidence led as to prior statements made by the complainant
    in relation to her allegations of sexual abuse.  While the trial Crown made
    a brief reference to the fact that some of these statements had been made
    during the complainant’s examination-in-chief, this was done merely to establish
    narrative and the Crown led no evidence as to the content of those statements.  It
    was, rather, defence counsel who elicited the details of the complainant’s
    prior statements.  This appears to have been done for two tactical purposes.  First,
    the defence attempted to demonstrate inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    account of the sexual abuse she had suffered at the appellant’s hands.  Second,
    the defence attempted to use certain of the complainant’s statements to advance
    its theory that the complainant made up her allegations of abuse during a
    dispute with the appellant over her failure to comply with his rules of the
    house. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge could well have given the usual limiting instruction in relation
    to the limited evidential value of prior consistent statements—indeed, it
    might have been preferable for him to have done so—we do not agree that in
    the circumstances of this case, the trial judge’s failure to give that instruction
    amounted to an error that undermined the fairness of this trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Details
    of the prior consistent statements were led by the defence for the tactical
    reasons we have mentioned.  The Crown made only passing reference to the
    fact that certain statements had been made and placed no meaningful reliance
    on them when addressing the jury.  Defence counsel, who had elicited the
    evidence, did not ask for a limiting instruction and did not object to the
    trial judge’s omission of any such instruction from his charge.  There is
    no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The trial judge gave
    a very balanced charge to the jury, carefully outlining the evidence led
    by both the Crown and the appellant, and fully and fairly explaining the
    positions taken by the prosecution and by the defence.  His instructions
    included a fair and accurate explanation of the use the defence sought to
    make of the complainant’s prior statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the use the defence made of the complainant’s prior consistent statements,
    the Crown’s lack of reliance on those statements, the trial judge’s instruction
    to the jury as to the inferences the appellant asked the jury to draw from
    those statements, and the absence of any objection from defence counsel at
    trial, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury received considerable evidence that discredited the appellant’s character,
    including: his criminal record, his sexual promiscuity and infidelity, his
    fathering of 16 children with 7 different women, his transmission of venereal
    disease to his common-law partner, his parental irresponsibility, his spousal
    abuse, and his illicit drug use. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not submit that any of this evidence was inadmissible and,
    indeed, some of it was led by the appellant himself.  Evidence of his transmission
    of venereal disease was clearly relevant—it was part of the Crown’s case
    that the appellant had committed incest, as the appellant’s common-law partner
    was infected at more or less the same time as the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave an appropriate limiting instruction with respect to the
    appellant’s criminal record and he also cautioned the jury not to draw any
    inference from the appellant’s inability to name all 16 of his children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would have been preferable had the trial judge cautioned the jury not to
    use evidence of the appellant’s lifestyle and discreditable conduct to reason
    that he was the sort of person who had a propensity to commit these offences.  That
    said, we are not persuaded that this deficiency in the charge constitutes
    reversible error in the circumstances of this case.  We arrive at that conclusion
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no objection from defence counsel, although he himself cautioned the
    jury about making improper use of this evidence in his closing address:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You may not
    like [C.M.] as a person but he’s not charged with having children with many
    women.  He’s not charged with smoking marijuana.  He is charged with sexually
    assaulting his daughter and beating her.  That’s what he is charged with
    because anything in his lifestyle led to a logical conclusion that he would
    have been sexually molesting his daughter [sic]. I’d say no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet
    defence counsel, for whatever reason, took no exception to the trial judge’s
    omission of any similar instruction in his charge.  As we have already noted,
    no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel has been made on this
    appeal.  Trial counsel may have had a reason for not seeking a limiting instruction.  It
    is possible that the defence did not wish to have the trial judge highlight
    or remind the jury of every element of the bad character evidence.  It is
    possible that the defence decided that the evidence that the appellant had
    experience with and access to a multitude of adult sexual partners suggested
    that he would have been less likely to have molested his own daughter.  Whatever
    the reason, the defence at the time of the trial decided not to object to
    this aspect of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  That is a significant
    factor that must weigh in our assessment of this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the failure to object, the existence of plausible tactical reasons
    for not objecting, and in view of the fact that, read as a whole, the charge
    was entirely fair and balanced, we are not persuaded that this aspect of
    the jury charge constituted an error that affected the fairness of this trial.  Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

    complainant’s mother made a passing comment as to her belief in the complainant’s
    truthfulness in response to a question posed by the trial judge.  No objection
    was made to the trial judge’s failure to warn the jury about this evidence.  We
    are far from persuaded that this passing comment could have occasioned any
    harm to the appellant.  Moreover, in all likelihood, an instruction along
    the lines now sought would only have served to highlight a fleeting reference
    to the witness’s opinion and have done the appellant’s position more harm
    than good.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant’s partner made a passing reference to her disbelief in the appellant’s
    explanation for his possession of a photograph of a female co-worker. Again,
    no objection was taken to the trial judge’s treatment of this evidence. This
    comment had no direct bearing on the appellant’s denial of the complainant’s
    evidence. The trial judge made it clear that the credibility of witnesses
    it was a matter exclusively for the jury to determine. We are not persuaded
    that there is any realistic prospect that the jury could have improperly
    used the witness’s disbelief in what the appellant said in relation to a
    collateral matter as a basis for rejecting his evidence as to the complainant’s
    allegations.</p>

    see no merit in the sentence appeal.  These were extremely serious offences
    involving the appalling sexual exploitation of the appellant’s own daughter
    over a period of three years.  The consequences for the complainant were
    grave.  She had to deal with sexually transmitted disease, pregnancy and
    abortion, and the humiliation of being sexually abused by her own father.  She
    suffered a significant physical injury.  She continues to struggle with the
    psychological trauma inflicted upon her by the appellant’s conduct.  While
    the sentence was certainly lengthy, it does not fall outside the permissible
    range of sentence for this conduct.</p>
