style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant worked for a Tim Horton’s restaurant (the respondent, numbered
    company).  The management of that outlet became concerned that staff members
    (not the appellant) were stealing from the store on the night shift.  A videotape
    was activated so that the management could watch the conduct of the employees.  After
    viewing a videotape that included a period of time during which the appellant
    was working on the takeout window, the manager became concerned that the
    appellant was stealing money by not depositing all the money received from
    customers into the cash register.  That manager contacted the owner who instructed
    him to contact the local police.  The police investigated and the appellant
    was charged with theft.  She was later acquitted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant commenced a lawsuit against the arresting officer (the respondent,
    May) and the numbered company.  She advanced numerous causes of action, including
    malicious prosecution, wrongful dismissal, intentional infliction of mental
    distress and defamation.  After a lengthy trial, the jury found against her
    on all issues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no basis upon which we can revisit the jury’s factual findings.  None
    of those findings can be properly characterized as unreasonable.  We approach
    this appeal on the basis that the jury was entitled on the evidence it heard,
    assuming it was properly instructed, to come to the factual conclusions reflected
    in the jury’s answers to the questions posed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also recognize that the test for interference with a civil jury verdict is
    a high one.  An appellate court will not order a new trial unless a substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred and the interests of justice
    plainly require a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant advanced several grounds of appeal in her factum.  Counsel made
    oral submissions in support of some of those grounds.  We have considered
    all those grounds of appeal but required submissions from the respondents
    on only three.  These reasons address only the three grounds on which we
    required submissions from the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    grounds upon which we required submissions are the following:  </p>
  <p><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the
    trial judge misdirect the jury on the requisite legal elements of the offence
    of theft and, if so, what was the impact of that error?</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span> Did
    the trial judge fail to adequately outline to the jury the position of the
    plaintiff with respect to the allegation of theft?</p>
  <p>(iii) Did the trial judge err in failing to limit the allegation of theft
    relied on by the defendants to a single occurrence referred to as the “toonie
    incident” and by allowing the defence to justify the theft allegation by
    reference to other occurrences captured on the videotape?</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The Definition of Theft</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the definition
    of theft.  The trial judge gave the jury an accurate definition of theft
    that included reference to the requisite mental element.  However, in expanding
    on the definition, he used the phrase “knowing <i>it could be</i> Tim Horton’s
    property” when he should have said “knowing <i>it was</i> Tim Horton’s property” [Emphasis
    added.].  The balance of the charge was, however, correct and, in particular,
    the trial judge had only moments earlier told the jury that the taking must
    be of another’s property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More
    to the point, the case turned on the appellant’s assertion that she was lawfully
    entitled to keep the money she took because that money represented proper
    tips.  There is no possibility that the jury could have misunderstood that
    the appellant was entitled to keep her tips. There was no assertion by anyone
    that the appellant was not entitled to keep her tips.  The whole thrust of
    the very long trial centred around the appellant’s assertion that she did
    not steal any money and that the money she was seen taking was her own tip
    money.  </p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The Position of the Plaintiff at Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    argument that the trial judge failed to adequately outline the plaintiff’s
    position on the issue of theft is to some extent addressed in our consideration
    of the first ground of appeal.  The trial judge did not deal separately with
    the position of either the plaintiff or the defendants on the theft related
    issues.  It would have been better had he made at least some discrete reference
    to the respective positions of the parties and expressly alerted the jury
    to the competing positions taken on whether the appellant had committed theft.  However,
    as we have already observed, the positions of the parties involving the issue
    of theft were simple and straightforward.  The jury could not have failed
    to appreciate those respective positions, which were fully explored throughout
    the lengthy evidence and in closing submissions by counsel.  We note that
    counsel for the appellant did not object to the jury instructions on this
    ground.  </p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The Scope of the Theft Allegation</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argued that the criminal theft allegation made against her was
    limited to the allegation of theft of a single toonie arising out of a single
    occurrence.  Counsel submits that the trial judge improperly allowed the
    defendants, in their defence of the malicious prosecution charge, to expand
    the allegation of theft to include other actions by the appellant seen on
    the videotape.  Counsel argues that as the criminal charge related only to
    the single alleged theft of one toonie, it was incumbent on the defendants,
    in defending against the malicious prosecution allegation, to limit their
    justification for the allegation to the single occurrence of theft involving
    the toonie.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without
    passing on the legal legitimacy of the appellant’s submission, we are satisfied
    that it fails for another reason.  We cannot agree on this record that the
    criminal allegation was limited to a single occurrence involving a single
    toonie.  As we cannot agree that the criminal allegation was as narrowly
    drawn as counsel alleges, it follows that this submission must fail.</p>
  <h4><span style='font-weight:normal'>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that the trial judge, in an appropriate but generous exercise of his
    discretion, declined to make any order as to costs against the appellant
    at trial.  The respondents have been entirely successful on the appeal and
    are entitled to their costs of the appeal if, in all the circumstances, they
    think it appropriate to seek those costs.  Should the respondents seek costs,
    they should provide written submissions of no more than seven pages within
    ten days of the release of these reasons.  The appellant should have ten
    days to respond in writing to those submissions.  Her response should be
    no more than seven pages.</p>
