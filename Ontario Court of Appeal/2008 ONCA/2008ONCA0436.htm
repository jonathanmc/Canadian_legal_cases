    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    New Brunswick</i>, 2008 SCC 9.  In that decision, at para. 34, the Supreme
    Court of Canada determined that there should now only be two standards of
    review – correctness and reasonableness.  The two variants of reasonableness
    review, reasonableness <i>simpliciter </i>and patent unreasonableness, are
    now collapsed into a single form of “reasonableness” review: <i>Dunsmuir</i> at
    para 45.  Both parties agree that the standard of reasonableness as described
    in <i>Dunsmuir </i>applies in reviewing the Tribunal’s decision.  As a result,
    I must determine whether the decision of the Tribunal meets the standard
    of reasonableness as described in the <i>Dunsmuir</i> decision.</p>

      not to note his complaints of back pain in the record for fear that it
      would interfere with his truck driver’s license, and in any event, his

      out on the record before it.  The Tribunal noted that no fracture or degenerative
      disease had been identified in 1979, that the respondent continued to work
      at the same job for nine of the twelve following years and that he regularly
      underwent medical examination with no back problems being recorded.  The

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, both parties agree that, in accordance with the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    recent decision in <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the standard of reasonableness applies
    to the review of the Tribunal’s decision.  Reasonableness is concerned “with
    whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes” depending
    on the particular legal and factual context.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 47.  Where
    the parties diverge is on the level of deference to be accorded to the decision
    within the “reasonableness” standard.  In essence, the appellant submits
    that, within the reasonableness standard, there are varying degrees of deference
    that apply.  The level of deference to be accorded will be determined by
    reference to existing jurisprudence.  In this case, the jurisprudence has
    established that the highest level of deference applies to Tribunal decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, the respondent submits that the
    “reasonableness standard” does not contain varying degrees of deference.  He
    relies on the decision in <i>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i> (2003),
    223 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.), which rejected the argument that “it is sometimes
    appropriate to apply the reasonableness standard more deferentially and sometimes
    less deferentially depending on the circumstances.”  (para. 43).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that <i>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i> predates
    the decision in <i>Dunsmuir</i> and therefore has not considered the approach
    to deference when the standards of reasonableness and patent unreasonableness
    have been collapsed into a single standard.  Although the majority in <i>Dunsmuir</i> did
    not offer specific comment on whether there are varying degrees of deference
    within the reasonableness standard, the appellant relies on the views expressed
    by Binnie J. in his concurring opinion.  At para. 139, Binnie J. notes that
    the decision to collapse reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> and patent unreasonableness
    served to “shift the debate (slightly) from choosing <i>between</i> two standards
    of reasonableness that each represent a different level of deference to a
    debate <i>within </i>a single standard of reasonableness to determine the
    appropriate level of deference.” [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the reference in paragraph 62 of the majority reasons
    to the “degree of deference” lends further support to its submission.  There,
    the majority set out the two step approach to judicial review as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>First, courts ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already
    determined in a satisfactory manner the <i>degree of deference</i> to be
    accorded with regard to a particular category of question.  Second, where
    the first inquiry proves unfruitful, courts must proceed to an analysis of
    the factors making it possible to identify the proper standard of review.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Although the respondent submits that this is simply a reference to the two
    standards, correctness and reasonableness, the appellant suggests reference
    to the “degree of deference” is confirmation that the majority shares Binnie
    J.’s view that there are different degrees of deference within the reasonableness
    standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    understand the majority in <i>Dunsmuir</i> to be referring now to only two
    degrees of deference, correctness, where no deference is accorded, and reasonableness,
    where deference is accorded.  It is not necessary or appropriate to then
    assess the degree of deference within the reasonableness standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, by collapsing the patently unreasonable standard and the reasonable
    standard, the majority has not set aside the court’s earlier decision in <i>Law
    Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>, nor has it signalled that courts must
    now puzzle over the degree of deference to give to a tribunal within the
    reasonableness standard.  The existence of varying degrees of deference within
    the single reasonableness standard suggests that a decision made by a tribunal
    will be found to be unreasonable if the court accords the tribunal a low
    degree of deference but that same decision will be found to be reasonable
    if the court decides to accord the tribunal a high degree of deference.  I
    do not read the decision of the majority in <i>Dunsmuir </i>as encompassing
    any such approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the majority explained that para. 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[E]ven if one could conceive of a situation in which a clearly
    or highly irrational decision were distinguishable from a merely irrational
    decision, it would be unpalatable to require parties to accept an irrational
    decision simply because, on a deferential standard, the irrationality of
    the decision is not clear <i>enough</i>.  It is also inconsistent with the
    rule of law to retain an irrational decision.  As LeBel J. explained in his
    concurring reasons in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    the essential question remains the same under both standards: was the decision
    of the adjudicator taken in accordance with reason?  Where the answer is
    no, for instance because the legislation in question cannot rationally support
    the adjudicator’s interpretation, the error will invalidate the decision,
    regardless of whether the standard applied is reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> or
    patent unreasonableness. …</p>

    conclusion does not signal that factors such as the nature and mandate of
    the decision-maker and the nature of the question being decided are to be
    ignored.  Applying the reasonableness standard will now require a contextual
    approach to deference where factors such as the decision-making process,
    the type and expertise of the decision-maker, as well as the nature and complexity
    of the decision will be taken into account.  Where, for example, the decision-maker
    is a minister of the Crown and the decision is one of public policy, the
    range of decisions that will fall within the ambit of reasonableness is very
    broad.  In contrast, where there is no real dispute on the facts and the
    tribunal need only determine whether an individual breached a provision of
    its constituent statute, the range of reasonable outcomes is, perforce, much
    narrower.</p>

    interpretation on this issue is strengthened by the majority description
    of “reasonableness”.  The description provided by the majority did not articulate
    varying degrees of deference, but instead referred simply to a deferential
    standard that mandates respect for the “decision-making process of adjudicative
    bodies with regard to both the facts and the law.”  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para.
    48.  The concept of reasonableness does not turn on a detailed analysis of
    whether the tribunal’s decision is subject to a high or low degree of deference.  In
    defining the concept of reasonableness, the majority in <i>Dunsmuir </i>instead
    emphasized the following at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A court conducting
    a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision
    reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and
    to outcomes.  In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with
    the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process.  But it is also concerned with whether the decision
    falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible
    in respect of the facts and law.</p>

    in the Tribunal’s reasons.  It is in this context that the guiding principles
    from <i>Dunsmuir </i>are to be applied to review the reasonableness of the

      Jacqmin’s opinion was that the 1979 injury made a significant contribution
      to the respondent’s current low back problems.  This opinion, however,
      was premised in part on the information provided to him by the respondent
      to the effect that over the years he had had persistent back pain and that
      he saw his family physician on and off for this problem to obtain medication.</span></p>

      the Tribunal had before it a report on the X-ray that was taken shortly
      after the 1979 injury.  That report states that there was no fracture or
      dislocation shown and that no significant degenerative disc changes were
      apparent.</span></p>

      Divisional Court’s conclusion that the Tribunal had no basis upon which

      problems had been continuous from the day of the accident forward.  As
      I have explained, I have concluded that the

      the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court discounted the evidence of the Tribunal’s medical consultant.  It
    did so because, in their view, the medical consultant based her report on
    incorrect information.  Specifically, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court indicated that the consultant erred when she stated that
    the respondent did not appear to have lost any time from work due to the
    accident.  In response, the appellant argues that the statement is correct
    in the sense that the respondent did not suffer any unpaid days as a result
    of the accident and never collected workplace safety insurance benefits.  This
    is because the respondent, who was absent from work for approximately two
    weeks, had taken this time as holidays.  The appellant submits that the consultant’s
    comment should be interpreted in this way and should not be taken to be an
    error.  In any event, even if the statement contained in the consultant’s
    report is considered to be an error, the Tribunal itself was well aware of
    the correct fact situation and would have given appropriate weight to the
    consultant’s report.</span></p>

      made no significant errors in fact-finding and the reasoning adopted to
