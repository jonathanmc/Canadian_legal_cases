    three counts of invitation to sexual touching and two counts of sexual
    interference. The offences involved three young male complainants between the
    ages of ten and twelve and they occurred over a period of one to one-and-a-half
    years. Mr. Cerda groomed the young complainants and then engaged in fellatio
    with two of them; the third complainant resisted his attempts. Mr.&nbsp;Cerda
    was age 18 and 19 at the time of the offences. He was 23 at the time of trial.</p>

    did not give a full and frank account of his dealings with them. Read in the
    context of the whole of her reasons, we are satisfied that the trial judge was
    entitled to make the assessment she did and we would not interfere with her
    findings or her conclusion. Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</span></p>

    conclude that a sentence of two years less one day in the reformatory was appropriate.
    We also take no issue with her reduction of that sentence to eighteen months on
    account of time spent in pretrial custody and the lengthy period of strict
    house arrest bail.</span></p>

    trial judge properly recognized that when an adult, even a young adult,
    invites a young boy to engage in sexual touching and persuades a young boy to
    receive fellatio and to perform fellatio on him; where the offences involved
    three victims over a period of at least a year to a year-and-a-half, it should,
    absent exceptional circumstances, attract incarceration in jail. She then went
    on to find that there were exceptional circumstances in this case, namely: (1)
    the personal circumstances of Mr. Cerda; (2) the strict house arrest terms he
    had complied with; and (3) his willingness to take counselling.</span></p>

    date, Mr. Cerda has failed to take any responsibility for his crimes; nor has
    he shown any indication that he appreciates the gravity of the harm he has
    inflicted on these innocent young children. In that context, Mr. Cerdas
    willingness to take counselling (for what one might ask) does not, of itself,
    constitute an exceptional circumstance. As for Mr. Cerdas age and his
    compliance with the strict house arrest bail terms, while we agree that these
    were factors the trial judge could take into account in concluding that a
    reformatory term was appropriate, in our view, more was required to find
    exceptional circumstances, such as would justify the imposition of a
    conditional sentence for these offences.</span></p>

    as our starting point the eighteen month custodial sentence that the trial
    judge otherwise felt would be just and reducing it by four months for the time
    Mr. Cerda has served under the conditional sentence, we would allow the appeal
    and vary the sentence to fourteen months imprisonment. The sentence of fourteen
    months will commence on the day Mr. Cerda surrenders. He is to surrender on
