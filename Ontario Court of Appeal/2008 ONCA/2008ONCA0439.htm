line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant challenges the verdict of the jury following a nine-day trial presided
    over by Pitt J., which dismissed the appellant’s claim in a slip and fall
    case.  The appellant slipped and fell as she was crossing the respondents’
    plaza parking lot.  She alleged that the respondents were responsible for
    the injuries she sustained as a result of the fall because they did not take
    reasonable care to keep their parking lot reasonably safe for pedestrians.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred by failing to discharge the jury
    following certain potentially prejudicial comments that counsel for the respondents
    made in his closing address and the appellant’s objections to these comments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    objections concerned comments by counsel that impugned the credibility of  the
    appellant’s three independent witnesses on issues that the appellant says
    were irrelevant and unfairly prejudiced the jury against her case. The comments
    suggested that two of the witnesses had a motive not to meet with the respondents’ counsel
    before the trial and that all three would have been expected to report any
    snowy conditions, had they existed, at the time of the accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    counsel’s objection to the closing, the trial judge dismissed the appellant’s
    motion for an order discharging the jury.  He decided instead to deal with
    the potential prejudice by a correcting instruction to the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge made no error in his decision to retain the jury.
    In <i>Hamstra v. British Columbia Rugby Union</i> [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1092, the
    Supreme Court stated: “The decision whether to discharge the jury should
    be a matter within the discretion of the trial judge…The jury should only
    be discharged if the trial judge considers that the prejudice cannot be cured…It
    has long been established that, absent an error of law, an appellate court
    should not interfere with the exercise by a trial judge of his or her discretion
    in the conduct of a trial. This applies with equal force to a decision to
    retain or discharge the jury. It cannot be overstated that the trial judge
    is in the best position to determine how to exercise this discretion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    following the remarks in issue, the trial judge instructed the jury in clear
    terms that the witnesses had no obligation to speak with defence counsel.  In
    our view, the trial judge appropriately dealt with the objection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    also told the jury there was no legal obligation on the witnesses to report
    the conditions.  He did add that the absence of any reports left the defendants
    in a difficult position regarding their defence. While in our view, the latter
    part of this instruction was unnecessary and could have distracted the jury
    from its central task, the jury’s verdict would inevitably have been the
    same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant's evidence regarding the amount of snow on the day of the accident
    was substantially challenged at trial as was the evidence of her witnesses.  Indeed,
    the meteorological reports filed at trial directly contradicted that evidence.  In
    addition, there was ample evidence to support the respondents' position that
    they took all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the parking area.  On
    the basis of all the evidence, the jury verdict would have been the same
    irrespective of the trial judge’s challenged reference. We would therefore
    dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents fixed in the amount of $10,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. </p>
