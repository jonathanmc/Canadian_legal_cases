    Oakville’s primary ground of appeal relates to the evidence of Mr. Zygmunt

    respondents.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville submits that the trial judge did not perform his gatekeeper function
    at the qualification stage and failed to delineate the area or areas of expertise
    upon which Mr.&nbsp;Gorski could properly give opinion evidence.  In light
    of that error,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville submits that the trial judge wrongly permitted Mr. Gorski to give
    crucial opinions on contentious issues about which he had no special skill,
    knowledge or training and upon which the trial judge relied in finding
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville liable. According to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville, absent Mr. Gorski’s impermissible opinion evidence, there was no
    case to meet. Hence, it submits that the action should be dismissed in its
    entirety, or alternatively, that a new trial should be ordered. </p>

    Oakville’s secondary ground of appeal centres on the issue of contributory
    negligence.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville submits that in finding Mr. Johnson blameless, the trial judge misconstrued
    or ignored pertinent evidence which showed that Mr. Johnson was riding his
    bicycle too quickly in the circumstances and was not keeping a proper lookout.
    Without conceding liability for the accident,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville submits that if it is to be held liable, liability should be apportioned
    on a 75:25 ratio with Mr. Johnson bearing the larger share. </p>

    appeal. I would, however, allow the appeal on the secondary ground and substitute
    a finding that Mr.&nbsp;Johnson was negligent in the operation of the bicycle
    and that his negligence contributed to the accident. I would apportion liability

      the accident and found as a fact that from a point 60 metres south of the
      south end of the bridge, where the road commenced its steepest decline
      of 18 percent, to the bridge itself, the road surface was marked by “unevenness
      or roughness”. Constable Michalski explained that the unevenness was due

      as “wash boarding”. Regardless of the precise term used, the trial judge’s

    down the hill on a tandem bicycle. When he first observed them, they were

      Marshall’s first thought when he saw the couple was that they were “going

      ahead of the bicycle than in the distance” and he was “alternately pedaling
      and coasting”. The bicycle appeared to be “upright and stable” and “there
      didn’t seem to be any lack of control at that point.”</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>Nonetheless,

    Marshall then saw the bicycle continue across the bridge, skidding in a straight

    now “out of control”. He estimated the speed of the bicycle as it crossed
    the bridge to be more than 40 <span lang=EN-US>kilometres</span> per hour.
    The trial judge accepted that figure and it accords with the estimate of

    hit a “fairly abrupt rise” in the pavement and it
    “rose into the air just a few inches.” Thereafter, he believed that the bicycle
    remained airborne until it eventually struck the embankment sideways at a
    height of approximately 3 feet (0.9 metres) up the wall.</p>

    3 feet in the air when it struck the embankment. The trial judge concluded
    that Mr. Marshall must have been mistaken on that aspect of his evidence

    could only have been made by the bicycle skidding along the road into the

lang=EN-US>At a point approximately 60 metres south of the south end of the bridge

      encountered a “speed wobble”. Constable Michalski said that the speed wobble
      was caused by the unevenness or roughness of the road surface. He almost
      lost control of his bicycle. The speed wobble continued almost to the point
      where the bicycle was brought to stop [just before the south end of the
      bridge]. On other runs down the hill, Constable Michalski determined that
      the highest speed at which he could travel without encountering the speed

    cause for concern. Having reached a speed of approximately 45 kilometres
    per hour, they encountered wash boarding on the road at approximately 60
    metres south of the south end of the bridge. This is the general area where
    the Johnsons were first observed by Frederick Marshall. This is the same
    area where Constable Michalski encountered the speed wobble. It is to be
    noted that … Sergeant Mac[I]ntosh did not observe Constable Michalski almost
    lose control of his bicycle. He had to be told about it after the fact. It
    is therefore not surprising to me that Frederick Marshall does not describe
    the tandem bicycle as being in a speed wobble or out of control. Frederick
    Marshall does say that Robert Johnson was looking down in the direction of
    the road a few feet in front of the front wheel. This would be consistent
    with someone attempting to deal with a speed wobble.</span></p>

      turn just to the north of the bridge. His attention was focused on regaining
      control of the bicycle. There was no reason for him to be concerned about
      the sharp right hand turn because there had been no warning given to him
      in advance of the bridge. When he looked up, he saw the checkerboard sign
      with the right pointing arrow. This is when he first became aware that
      he would be required to make a sharp right hand turn just to the north
      of the bridge. It must be remembered that just south of the bridge, a cyclist
      would be required to make a slight line adjustment because of the alignment

    Oakville posted better warning signs and taken care to ensure, as far as
    possible, that the road grades were not excessive and that there were no
    undulations in the steepest part of the road that could potentially cause
    a loss of control due to “speed wobble”. In the circumstances, given the
    location of the undulations on the steepest part of the slope and the fact
    that they could not be seen or anticipated, they constituted a trap for the
    unwary. In my view, they were a substantial contributing factor to Mr. Johnson’s
    loss of control of the bicycle and the ensuing accident. </span></p>
