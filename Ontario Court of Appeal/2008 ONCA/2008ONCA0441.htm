    relevant facts of this case are straightforward.  In April 2000, B &amp;
    B Enterprises (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London) Ltd. entered into a credit arrangement with TD Canada Trust.  The
    agreement provided for a $232,000 revolving line of credit.  The loan was
    payable on demand by TD.  Brian Beretta and Matthew Bralovich, the two principals
    of B &amp; B, unconditionally guaranteed the line of credit advanced by TD
    to B &amp; B.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Beretta resigned as a director of B &amp; B in January 2005.  He did not
    have any further involvement in the day-to-day operation of the company,
    but he remained a shareholder.  Beretta and Bralovich discussed removing
    Beretta as a personal guarantor on B &amp; B’s line of credit, but no steps
    were taken to do so.  Beretta remained on the guarantee.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    about March 2005, TD became concerned about the financial stability of B &amp; B’s
    business and, more specifically, the status of its credit arrangement with
    B &amp; B.  TD pressed Mr. Bralovich to reduce the debt.  In June 2005, TD
    formally reduced the line of credit to $200,000. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>B &amp; B
    continued to have financial difficulties, and TD remained concerned about
    the status of the loan.  By letter dated July 22, 2005, TD advised B
    &amp; B that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>      As
        of August 17, 2005, the revolving line of credit would be “converted” to
    a non-revolving demand loan;</li>
    <li>      The
    interest rate would remain the same; and</li>
    <li>      The
        loan would be amortized over forty-eight months.  B &amp; B would be
        required to make monthly payments of $4,200 plus interest beginning in
    September 2005.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the same letter, TD advised B &amp; B that if it was not satisfied with the
    restructuring, it could repay the loan in its entirety within thirty days.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>B &amp; B
    accepted the restructuring terms proposed in the July 22, 2005 letter.  At
    that time, Mr. Beretta, who was no longer involved in the operation of B &amp; B,
    was not aware of the bank’s position, the proposed terms for restructuring
    the loan, or B &amp; B’s acceptance of those terms.  Mr. Beretta became aware
    that the loan had been restructured in the fall of 2005.  Over the next year,
    Mr. Beretta had various discussions with the bank in which he indicated he
    might be prepared to pay off B &amp; B’s indebtedness and take an assignment
    of TD’s security.  These discussions did not result in any change in the
    loan arrangement or the guarantees. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>B &amp; B
    made the payments required under the restructuring until December 2006.  Mr.
    Bralovich also made a substantial payment against the loan.  These payments
    significantly reduced B &amp;
    B’s indebtedness to TD.  B &amp; B failed to make the January 2007 payment.  TD
    demanded payment of the outstanding amount ($70,645.52 plus interest and
    legal fees) within thirty days.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Repayment
    was not made, and in March 2007, TD sued B &amp; B on the debt and Mr. Beretta
    on the guarantee.  Mr. Bralovich, the other guarantor, had declared bankruptcy
    in 2006.  B &amp; B did not defend the action.  Mr. Beretta filed a statement
    of defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    June 2007, TD moved for default judgment against B &amp; B and summary judgment
    against Mr. Beretta.  The motion judge, Corbett J., granted default judgment
    against B &amp; B.  That order has not been appealed.  Corbett J. also granted
    summary judgment against Mr. Beretta, accepting TD’s contention that there
    was no genuine issue for trial in respect of Mr. Beretta’s liability under
    the guarantee.  Mr. Beretta appealed that order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Beretta was not represented on the summary judgment motion.  He was ably
    represented by counsel on this appeal.  Not surprisingly, the arguments made
    in this court are somewhat different than those made by Mr. Beretta on the
    motion.  I will address only the arguments made in this court.</p>
  <h2>A.  The Failure to Give Mr. Beretta Notice of the Restructuring of the
    Loan in July 2005</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Mr. Beretta submits that TD unilaterally, and without notice to Mr. Beretta,
    varied the terms of the credit agreement with B &amp; B in July 2005 when
    it restructured the credit arrangement and changed it from a revolving line
    of credit to a term loan.  Counsel submits that whether Mr. Beretta is regarded
    as a principal debtor or a guarantor, the variation of material terms of
    the loan without notice to him relieved him of any liability under the guarantee.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    submits that if Mr. Beretta was a principal debtor, he was entitled to notice
    of the amendments to the credit agreement, and that since TD did not provide
    such notice, he is no longer liable under that agreement.  In the alternative,
    counsel submits that if Mr. Beretta was a guarantor only, he was entitled
    in equity to notice of any material variation in the credit agreement between
    TD and B &amp; B, unless in his guarantee he expressly gave up the right
    to notice.  In a careful review of the terms of the guarantee, counsel points
    out that while it gives TD broad authorization to unilaterally alter the
    credit arrangements with B &amp; B without affecting the guarantee, it does
    not speak to the issue of notice.  Counsel contends that even if TD could
    unilaterally alter the terms of the loan without affecting the validity of
    the guarantee, it could not do so without notice to Mr. Beretta absent an
    express agreement that no notice was required.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot accept the basic premise of these submissions.  I do not think that
    TD’s restructuring of the loan in July 2005 altered the terms of the credit
    arrangement between itself and B &amp; B.  Rather, I think the restructuring
    was an enforcement measure that was clearly contemplated by the terms of
    the credit agreement.  I acknowledge that some of the language used by the
    TD officials in July 2005 (“restructuring”, “conversion”) could suggest new
    terms.  My analysis, however, turns on the language used in the credit agreement
    and the guarantee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the appellant’s arguments depend on the contention that the bank materially
    altered the terms of the credit agreement with B &amp; B, it is appropriate
    to begin with an examination of those terms.  The credit agreement provided
    for an operating line of credit in the amount of $232,000.  The credit facility
    could be terminated at any time by TD.  Paragraph 8 of the credit agreement
    set out the various conditions giving rise to a default by B
    &amp; B.  These included “an adverse change … in the Customer’s [B &amp; B]
    financial condition …” and TD’s reasonable belief that “any of the security
    granted by the Customer is in jeopardy”.   B
    &amp; B’s inventory was part of the security for the loan.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    9 of the agreement speaks to the remedies or enforcement mechanisms available
    to TD upon default.  These include:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>If a default
      occurs, Canada Trust may demand repayment of all or any part of the indebtedness,
      either as soon as it occurs or at any other time Canada Trust chooses</u> (it
      is not required to give any notice to the customer or grant any grace period
      or cure time).  <u>If
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    Trust demands repayment of any part of the indebtedness, it becomes due and
    payable immediately.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    2.1 of the credit agreement is also relevant.  It reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact that
    this Agreement provides for events of default, periodic required repayment
    and rights of acceleration in no way changes the demand nature of these Credit
    Facilities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    steps taken by TD in July 2005 were in response to a default by B &amp; B
    under the terms of the agreement and amounted to a demand for the repayment
    of the credit facility by B &amp; B.  TD gave B &amp; B a choice – it could
    repay the debt over time on the schedule set out by TD or it could repay
    the entire debt within thirty days.  TD’s decisions not to advance further
    funds and to make the demand in the form that it did were clearly envisioned
    by the terms of the credit agreement.  Resort to the remedial provisions
    available under the agreement cannot amount to a material change of the terms
    of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    can Mr. Beretta complain that he was unaware of the terms of the agreement.  He
    acknowledged the following in para. 2 of his guarantee.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Guarantor
    [Beretta] acknowledges that the obligations of the Customer which make up
    the Guaranteed Indebtedness are described in, and governed by, the provisions
    of the Credit Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    Mr. Beretta knew that TD could, if it chose to do so, proceed exactly as
    it did upon B &amp; B’s default.  He cannot now say that in doing so TD altered
    the terms of the credit arrangement and was required to give him notice of
    that alteration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    Mr. Beretta, acting personally before Corbett J., understandably did not
    make the specific argument I am now addressing, Corbett J. did refer to the
    nature of the credit agreement in the course of addressing an issue that
    arose on the motion.  His reading of that agreement is consistent with mine.  He
    observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, in reading
    s. 9 of the Loan Agreement [the remedy provision], it is clear that Canada
    Trust may demand repayment of all or any part of the indebtedness as soon
    as it occurs, or at any time later, and that <u>the demand for refinancing
    was not a demand to change the terms of the loan agreement, but rather a
    demand that the indebtedness be paid down.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I am satisfied the appellant’s submission fails because TD’s actions in July
    2005 cannot be characterized as altering the material terms of the loan,
    it is unnecessary for me to address the arguments that the failure to give
    Mr. Beretta, either as principal debtor or guarantor, notice of the alterations
    in the terms of the agreement rendered the guarantee unenforceable against
    him.  I would, however, make one observation.  On a plain reading of the
    documents, Mr. Beretta was a guarantor of the loan and not a principal debtor.</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Did
    TD Ignore Its Duty to Protect Its Security Under the Credit Agreement?</h2>

    credit facility was secured against its inventory.  Mr. Beretta argued that
    in the months prior to B &amp; B’s default in January 2007, he repeatedly
    expressed concerns to TD about the operation of B &amp; B’s business.  Counsel
    submits that there was evidence before the motion judge that TD had acted
    negligently in failing to take steps to preserve the value of the inventory,
    thereby increasing Mr. Beretta’s indebtedness under the guarantee.  Counsel
    submits that this evidence raised a triable issue.  </p>

    similar argument was made before the motion judge.  He rejected the submission
    for two reasons.  First, he pointed to s. 5 of the guarantee.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This Guarantee
    is unconditional.  The Guarantor’s obligations are independent of the Customer’s
    obligations and Canada Trust may demand payment from the Guarantor even if
    Canada Trust does not do any of the following things.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Protect
    any security interest; [or]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Proceed
    against any security.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TD
    did not move against the security interest that it had in the inventory.  I
    agree with Corbett J. that, “section 5 of the guarantee agreement is a complete
    answer to this argument.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Corbett
    J. also rejected the argument on the basis that TD was never in a position
    to control the inventory before it made its demand.  TD did not appoint a
    receiver, and the B &amp; B management remained in control of the company
    until the demand was made.  As Corbett J. observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Duties to manage
    or supervise the Company and its assets simply do not arise for the bank
    in this circumstance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, I agree with the analysis of Corbett J.  This ground of appeal cannot
    succeed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  Under the terms of the guarantee, TD is entitled
    to costs on a substantial indemnity basis.  Counsel for TD proposes costs
    in the amount of $4,681.25, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  I would
    grant costs in that amount.</p>
