    Trust was created to provide the purchasers of units with an investment opportunity
    to realize both capital appreciation and distributions through direct investment
    in commodities-related income fund issuers and indirect exposure to commodities
    that make up the Rogers International Commodity Index (“RICI”).  The indirect
    exposure to commodities that make up the RICI was obtained by purchasing
    common shares of Canadian public companies and entering into a forward agreement
    with a bank that the Trust would sell the common share portfolio for a price
    that was indirectly linked to the RICI.  Once the Trust was fully invested
    it owned: (a) a portfolio of income fund securities; (b) the common share
    portfolio and the Trust’s rights under the associated forward agreement;
    and (c) cash. </p>

    a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    based investment firm.  The respondents began purchasing units of the Trust
    on the TSE in January 2006 and continued to make market purchases of units
    of the Trust until August 2006.  By that time the respondents held over 1.7
    million units, over ten percent of the total outstanding units.</p>

    August 1 and 17, 2006, which was the redemption period provided for in the
    Declaration of Trust, almost 5 million units, including all of the units
    held by the respondents, were tendered for redemption.  These units represented
    27.57 percent of the outstanding units.  As will be explained later, a key
    date is the Valuation Date, which in 2006 was August 31.  On that date, the
    redemption of the units was complete and the respondents and the other redeeming
    unit holders no longer had any voting rights or rights to distributions.</p>

    of its understanding of the Declaration of Trust, the appellant did not begin
    to dispose of the necessary securities to be able to redeem the units until
    after August 31.  By September 22, 2006, the date by which the unit holders
    were to be paid for their redeemed units, the appellant had sold at least
    27.57 percent of most of the various securities that were held in the portfolio
    as of the Valuation Date.  However, the appellant did not dispose of 27.57
    percent of each of the securities.  For some of the securities, the appellant
    disposed of a small number of shares to establish a price and then used that
    price to determine the value of a <i>pro rata</i> share.  In the result,
    the appellant realized $9.815 per unit which was paid out to the former holders
    who had redeemed their units.<a href="#_ftn1"

    that the appellant used the wrong method and that they were entitled to approximately
    fifty cents more per unit.  Accordingly, they brought an application for
    a declaration.</p>

    5.1 gives unit holders the right to surrender their units for redemption
    on the tenth business day before the last business day in August.  As indicated,
    in the year in question on this appeal that day was August 17.  Clause 5.1
    provides that these units “will be redeemed on the Valuation Date”, which
    was

    the application judge, the issue of interpretation dividing the parties in
    relation to Clause 5.3 was whether the term “as at such Valuation Date” modified
    the phrase “Net Realized Proceeds per Unit”.  The application judge held
    that it did and the appellant no longer argues that he erred in doing so.  Rather,
    it now argues that the term “as at such Valuation Date” properly interpreted
    means “on or after” the Valuation Date.  It does not seem that this argument
    was made to the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “Net Realized Proceeds per Unit” is defined in the interpretation part
    of the Declaration of Trust.  The definition provides two different ways
    of arriving at a value as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>“Net Realized
      Proceeds per Unit”</b> means the amount obtained by dividing either:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(i)       the aggregate proceeds received by the Trust on the disposition
    of the <i>pro rata</i> share of the Portfolio Securities represented by the
    Units surrendered for redemption, less brokerage fees, commissions and all
    other transaction costs relating to such disposition and less the <i>pro
    rata</i> share of the liabilities of the Trust; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(ii)      if for any reason the Manager determines that it is not practicable
    for the Trust to effect such disposition, then the <i>pro rata</i> share
    of the Net Asset Value represented by the Units surrendered for redemption,
    less the brokerage fees, commissions and all other transaction costs that
    would have resulted from such disposition,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>by the number
    of Units surrendered for redemption. For certainty of interpretation, the
    disposition of a <i>pro rata</i> share of the Portfolio Securities will entail
    the pre-settlement of a <i>pro rata</i> portion of the Forward Agreement;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    simple terms, the difference between the two methods of calculation is that
    under method (i) the redeeming unit holders receive their share of the actual
    proceeds of the disposition of sufficient of the Trust’s portfolio to meet
    the requirements of the redemption, whereas under method (ii) they receive
    the notional “Net Asset Value” of their share less notional costs of disposition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Net
    Asset Value is also a defined term in Article 3.  Clause 3.5 provides that
    the Net Asset Value of the Trust “on a particular date, shall be equal to
    the aggregate value of the Trust Property on such date less the aggregate
    value of the Trust’s liabilities on such date, expressed in Canadian dollars”.  Article
    3 goes on to set out various valuation rules including rules that apply on
    the Valuation Date.  In short, the Net Asset Value is not actually determined
    on a particular date but rather is the weighted average trading price of
    a security during the three consecutive trading days ending on the Valuation
    Date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Operating
    on the assumption that it was using method (i), the appellant sold the necessary
    percentage of the securities after the Valuation Date and redeemed the units
    at $9.815 per unit.  The respondents took the position that since the appellant
    did not sell the units in accordance with method (i) before the Valuation
    Date, they were entitled to the amount calculated in accordance with method
    (ii).</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concedes that where method (ii) of calculating Net Realized Proceeds
    per Unit is used, the date for making that determination is the Valuation
    Date of August 31.  However, it argues that if it actually chooses to sell
    the securities, August 31 is not the date for making the determination under
    method (i); rather, it is merely a start date and it is the proceeds of sale
    of securities on or after August 31 that are used to calculate the Net Realized
    Proceeds per Unit.  I do not accept this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the phrase “determined as at such Valuation Date”, which the appellant
    now concedes modifies the term “Net Realized Proceeds per Unit”, applies
    to both methods of calculating the Net Realized Proceeds per Unit.  I cannot
    read
    “determined as at” the Valuation Date as applying to one method but not the
    other.  To do so is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the phrase.  It
    is also inconsistent with other parts of Clause 5.3, such as the payment
    requirements which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Trustee
    shall, on or before the fifteenth Business Day <i>following the Valuation
    Date on which a Unitholder’s units are redeemed</i>, make, or arrange for
    the Transfer Agent to make, payment of the redemption price per Unit in respect
    of the Units redeemed <i>together with any unpaid distribution in respect
    of such Units which became payable on or before such Valuation Date</i> less
    any amount required to be withheld therefrom under applicable law. Payment
    shall be made by wire transfer to CDS with instructions concerning delivery
    to the CDS Participants or by some other method as the Trustee deems appropriate.
    Any payment so made shall, unless a cheque is not honoured on presentation,
    discharge the Trust and the Trustee from all liability to the Unitholder
    in respect of the amount thereof plus any amount required by law to be withheld,
    and the Units so redeemed shall be cancelled and not reissued. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    5.3, which is the clause that speaks specifically about redemption, refers
    to “redeemed” in the past tense, and also refers to unpaid distributions
    that “became payable on or before such Valuation Date”.  This suggests that
    the Valuation Date is the date for determining the redemption price.  The
    two definitions of “Net Realized Proceeds per Unit” in the interpretation
    section of the Declaration of Trust provide two ways for making that calculation,
    but Article 5.3 directs that the determination of redemption price must be
    made “as at such Valuation Date” – not some later date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further
    support for this interpretation can be found in the economics associated
    with distributions. The interpretation the appellant urges would enable potential
    manipulation of the sale process to deprive the seller of full value of the
    security.  If the manager were to become aware of a pending distribution
    on certain securities scheduled to take place between the Valuation Date
    and the 15th Business Day following the Valuation Date, the manager could
    wait until after the distribution to sell the securities subject to the distribution.
    The seller would receive a sale price reduced to reflect the amount of the
    distribution and, under the terms of the agreement, would not be entitled
    to participate in the distribution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty in this case is that because the appellant took a different view
    of the interpretation of “Net Realized Proceeds per Unit”, it did not commence
    disposition of the necessary securities to meet the redemption requirements
    until after the Valuation Date.  Thus, the appellant submits that there was
    no express determination by the appellant as manager that it was “not practicable”
    for the Trust to sell the securities within the meaning of method (ii).  The
    motion judge reasoned that since the appellant failed to take action to invoke
    method (i), by default method (ii) was the method for determining the redemption
    price.  </p>

    is a reasonable interpretation of the document.  Otherwise, the appellant
    would be in breach of the Declaration of Trust for neither having sold the
    requisite part of the portfolio when it should have to get the necessary
    cash to redeem the former unit holders in accordance with method (i), nor
    having made the requisite determination under method (ii).</p>

    appellant submits that this interpretation of Net Realized Proceeds per Unit
    is inconsistent with the duty of the court to not simply look at the plain
    meaning of the terms of the document but also take into account the context
    or circumstances in which the words are used: see <i>Dumbrell v. The Regional
    Group of Companies Inc.</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 616 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) at para. 52.  The appellant points to evidence concerning the evolution
    of the definition of Net Realized Proceeds per Unit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    June 2005, most funds managed by the appellant provided for redemption at
    the Net Asset Value per Unit, which was defined as the value of the assets
    on the redemption date less the value of the liabilities of the fund on that
    date divided by the number of units then outstanding.  Due to the potential
    for manipulation of the Net Asset Value per Unit by the redeeming unit holders
    to the detriment of those unit holders who did not redeem, the appellant
    changed the method of calculating the Net Asset Value per Unit for its listed
    investment funds by providing that the assets would be valued based upon
    the weighted average trading price over the three business days ending on
    the redemption date.  The purpose of this change was to prevent the non-redeeming
    unit holders of such funds from being penalized by trading resulting in an
    artificial increase in the Net Asset Value per Unit that would have to be
    paid to the redeeming unit holders.  Managers of other listed investment
    funds made similar changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence is that despite these changes, the listed investment funds managed
    by the appellant continued to experience significant redemptions.  These
    redemptions were detrimental to the non-redeeming unit holders of the funds
    because brokerage commissions are not taken into account in the calculation
    of Net Asset Value per Unit and, therefore, would be borne entirely by the
    non-redeeming unit holders.  Further, the Net Asset Value per Unit is based
    on the last trading price of the portfolio securities which does not always
    coincide, and is often higher, than the price that is obtained for the securities
    sold to meet the redemption.  Finally, large sell orders necessitated by
    redemptions would have a downward pressure on the price of securities held
    by the funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that changes were made to the Declaration of Trust to meet
    these problems and, so far as possible, shift the burden of redemption to
    the redeeming unit holders where it belongs.  The principal mechanism was
    to allow the appellant as manager to redeem units with the actual disposition
    proceeds less the actual costs of disposition, or in other words, in accordance
    with method (i) for determining the Net Realized Proceeds per Unit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this evidence of context or circumstances is of limited assistance
    in interpreting the relevant clauses.  In the Declaration of Trust, brokerage
    commissions are taken into account whichever method is used.  Under method
    (i) it is the actual commissions; under method (ii) a notional calculation
    is made.  As to the problem that the Net Asset Value is often higher than
    the price that is obtained for the securities sold, this is an avoidable
    problem.  It only arises if the manager does not sell the necessary portion
    of the portfolio before the Valuation Date in accordance with method (i).  If
    the manager sells the necessary percentage of the portfolio, which is known
    as of the last day for unit holders to redeem their units, the calculation
    will be made in accordance with method (i).  Consequently, the Net Asset
    Value contemplated by method (ii) would be irrelevant.  Method (i) was incorporated
    in the Declaration of Trust to give the appellant the option of redeeming
    units with the actual disposition proceeds.  However, if the appellant does
    not avail itself of this option, it should not be permitted to complain that
    the Net Asset Value calculation under method (ii) is imperfect.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the problem of downward pressure on the price of securities brought about
    by large sell orders is going to be a concern whether the dispositions take
    place in the fifteen days before August 31 or the fifteen days after August
    31.  The point of giving the manager the option to redeem the units by using
    the actual disposition proceeds realized as of the Valuation Date in accordance
    with method (i), is that it shifts the risk of declining value to the redeeming
    unit holders.  I do not read the clauses involved as requiring some notional
    calculation when using method (i) to require the appellant to redeem the
    units for some amount different from the amounts actually received as of
    the Valuation Date.  Rather, the redeeming unit holders are entitled to the
    aggregate proceeds actually received by the Trust “determined as at such
    Valuation Date”.  This interpretation is no less fair to the non-redeeming
    shareholders than the one advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a fallback and to afford the appellant discretion in managing the Trust,
    if for any reason it is impracticable to dispose of a particular security
    by the Valuation Date, the manager can resort to method (ii) in relation
    to that security.  In fact, the appellant did resort to method (ii) in 2006
    in relation to certain securities, even when it believed it was acting in
    accordance with method (i).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    observation provides further support for the conclusion that (ii) was the
    method for determining the redemption price.  With respect to a small portion
    of the amount redeemed, the appellant determined that it was not practicable
    for the Trust to dispose of these particular interests.  However, the agreement
    does not allow the manager to arrive at a redemption value using both (i)
    and (ii).  Since the appellant determined that it was not practicable for
    the Trust to dispose of all of the amount being redeemed, the appellant must
    have been proceeding under (ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    interpreted, I see no basis for the appellant’s submission that such an interpretation
    is factually inoperable and commercially unworkable.  The appellant submits
    that during the period between the receipt of redemption notices and the
    Valuation Date, the Trust could have been buying and selling securities and
    purchasing its own units in the market.  Thus, it submits that in order for
    the redemption provisions to be administrable, it was necessary for the appellant
    to determine what the holdings of the Trust were so as to be able to dispose
    of the applicable percentages of those holdings.  It must also be certain
    as of which date it would have to make the determination regarding which
    assets to sell.  It argues that commercial reality dictated that this determination
    could only be made on the Valuation Date and not before.  I do not accept
    this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s general discretion to determine all questions and matters of
    doubt could have been used between August 17 and 31 to satisfactorily dispose
    of the securities by the Valuation Date.  The appellant knew as of August
    17 what percentage of securities needed to be sold in order to redeem the
    unit holders.  It had ten business days to make the necessary dispositions.  By
    August 31 it also knew the amount of the various liabilities in order to
    complete the calculation.  As the motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is not shown
    on the material that sub-paragraph (i) is inoperable factually in the period
    prior to the Valuation Date.  If there is some administrative difficulty,
    the Declaration contains provisions that would likely allow determinations
    to be made in the pre-Valuation Date period that would allow the dispositions
    to be made satisfactorily during that period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the respondents point out, one of the mechanisms available to the appellant
    is the power under the Declaration of Trust to hold cash.  Under Article
    2.7 of the Declaration of Trust, “in order to provide liquidity for the redemption
    of Units, Trust Property may also be held in Cash Equivalents”.  In fact,
    even when the appellant thought it was entitled to invoke method (i) after
    Valuation Date, the evidence shows that the appellant sold securities in
    excess of 27.57 percent, generating cash in excess of the amount needed to
    pay the redeeming unit holders. The Declaration Trust, which was drafted
    by the appellant, gave it broad powers that would have permitted it to comply
    with method (i) by Valuation Date.</p>
