  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the decision of Cumming J., which involved the interpretation
    of a joint venture agreement entered into between Sigma Ajax Inc. (Sigma)
    and 1346181 Ontario Limited (134).  The motion judge was required to determine
    whether a Purchase Agreement, which was put forward by 1617651 Ontario Corp.
    (161) to acquire 134’s interest in the joint venture, complied with the transfer
    provisions of the joint venture agreement (JVA).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    7 of the JVA allowed a co-owner to sell part of its interest, but only with
    the consent of the co-owner.  Section 9 of the JVA provided that, without
    the consent of the other co-owner, one co-owner could sell “all (but not
    less than all) of its Co-Owners Interest”.  Section 7.5 of the JVA further
    required a proposed purchaser to agree to be bound by, and to perform, the
    provisions of the JVA; any purchaser was required to step into the shoes
    of the joint venture partner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that 161 “agreed to step into 134 shoes under the
    JVA”.  On the issue of whether the Purchase Agreement complied with the provision
    of the JVA requiring the sale of “all” of 134’s interest, the motion judge
    reasoned at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The wording of the JVA is somewhat ambiguous and
    this assertion by Sigma has some superficial force.  However, reading the
    JVA as an entirety and observing the reality that the residential property
    has been sold with only a flow of money being received by Sigma and 134 as
    the take-back blanket mortgage is discharged with the sales of the residential
    lots, it is apparent that the continuing “interest”
    of 134 in reality is simply its interest in the Elm Ajax Plaza JV.  134’'s
    entire interest therein is the subject of 161’s offer.  This interpretation
    of the JVA gives commercial efficacy to the JVA and, in particular, to the
    agreement seen in s. 9 that there can be a sale by one co-owner without the
    consent of the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge had made a number of orders to advance the disentanglement of
    the two families, each of whom owned a 50 per cent interest in 134.  On this
    motion, he reached a result that he described in the above paragraph as efficacious.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    role of the court in interpreting a commercial agreement is to search for
    an interpretation “which, from the whole of the contract, would appear to
    promote or advance the true intent of the parties at the time of entry into
    the contract.”  <i>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery
    Insurance Co., </i>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Parties
    must be held to the bargain they struck.  While the motion judge concluded
    that the agreement was “somewhat ambiguous”, he did not explain the nature
    of that ambiguity.  Moreover, such an ambiguity is not supported by a consideration
    of the whole of the agreement read in light of the parties’ intent when they
    entered into the agreement.  The JVA unambiguously provides that, absent
    consent, a sale by one of the co-owners must be for “all” of that co-owner’s
    interest in the joint venture.  A
    “Co-Owner’s Interest” includes “Property”, which is defined to include all
    “property, whether real or personal”.  Accordingly, it includes the vendor
    take-back mortgage.  We do not agree with the motion judge that this mortgage
    is “only a flow of money”; it represents a security interest in the land.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the undisputed definitions in the JVA and the evidence put forward on the
    motion lead inevitably to the conclusion that 134’s interest was not restricted
    to the “plaza” portion of the property that was the subject of the Purchase
    Agreement.  It also included the vendor take-back mortgage regarding the “residences” portion
    of the property as well as the ownership of shares in two trustee companies
    that held the two portions of the property.  In addition, the joint venture’s
    assets were subject to a secured obligation to repay $2.2 million of shareholder
    loans to 134 and to Sigma and the joint venture’s security interest in the
    vendor take-back mortgage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that, on its face, the Purchase Agreement’s offer to buy only the “Plaza
    JVA” did not constitute an offer to acquire “all”
    of 134’s interest.  Thus, it also did not satisfy the JVA requirement that
    a prospective purchaser step into the shoes of the selling partner.  Accordingly,
    the Purchase Agreement did not fit within section 9 of the JVA so as to trigger
    Sigma’s right of first refusal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from giving effect to the plain wording of the JVA, this interpretation reflects
    the commercial reality that the Purchase Agreement would have left Sigma,
    without its consent, not with one new co-owner replacing 134, but with two
    co-owners: 161 for the plaza project and 134 for the vendor take-back mortgage
    on the residences project.  This situation of having to deal with two partners,
    instead of one, was precisely the situation that the parties to the JVA sought
    to preclude by ss. 7 and 9 of the JVA, and why they agreed to only an “all
    or nothing” transfer of their interests in the joint venture.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed and the finding that the Purchase Agreement came within
    the terms of the JVA is set aside as is the costs order below.  Instead,
    a declaration will issue that the 161 Purchase Agreement does not comply
    with the JVA.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the result, it is unnecessary to consider the appellant’s application to
    introduce fresh evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is entitled to costs of the motion below as well as costs of the
    appeal, which are fixed in the combined amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and Goods and Services Tax.  </p>
