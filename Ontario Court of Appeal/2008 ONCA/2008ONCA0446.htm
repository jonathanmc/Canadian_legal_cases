  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ontario Racing Commission appeals from a finding of liability for the torts
    of misfeasance in public office, inducing breach of contract and intentional
    interference with economic relations.  The liability arose from a telephone
    call made by one of its officials to the Rideau-Carlton Raceway where the
    respondent had been employed.  The official advised that the respondent would
    not be approved as a starter for the 2003 season.  As a result of the telephone
    call, the respondent was not rehired by the raceway and suffered damages.  The
    trial judge found that the telephone call constituted an “intentional illegal
    act” sufficient to make out the torts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.  In respect of the tort
    of misfeasance in public office, while I am of the view that the official’s
    phone call did not constitute an “intentional illegal act”, I find that the
    appellant’s conduct, considered as a whole, satisfies the essential requirements
    of the tort.  The Commission effectively frustrated all efforts by the respondent
    to have the decision to refuse his approval reviewed, as was his statutory
    right.  This conduct, considered together with the official’s phone call,
    was done with reckless indifference as to its legality or its probable consequences
    to the respondent and was contrary to certain provisions of the <i>Racing
    Commission Act, 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 20 (the <i>Act</i>).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find that the trial judge erred in imposing liability for the torts of inducing
    breach of contract and interference with economic relations.  However, this
    finding does not ultimately interfere with the trial judge’s damage award,
    which, as I will explain, applies with equal force on the basis of the finding
    of liability for the tort of misfeasance in public office. </p>

    February 28, 2003, Bill Fines, the Ontario Racing Commission’s Supervisor
    of Standardbred Racing, received a report from a Commission investigator,
    citing a number of allegations of misconduct against the respondent.  The
    most significant allegation was that the respondent maintained a hidden ownership
    interest and covert training responsibility for a horse owned by his step-daughter.  The
    report included audio-taped interviews conducted with the respondent by a
    Commission investigator on February 24, 2003, in which the respondent denied
    the allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early March 2003, Mr. Fines telephoned Ron Barr, the general manager of the
    Rideau-Carleton Raceway.  By this time, the raceway was two weeks late in
    submitting its 2003 application of approval for officials for the upcoming
    season.  In this phone call, Mr. Fines told Mr. Barr that the respondent “would
    not be approved” as a starter for the upcoming season if his name was included
    on the application.  Mr. Barr was told that he was “required to get somebody
    else” for approval.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Barr perceived the instruction from Mr. Fines as a “directive” or “a mandate
    from the Racing Commission”.  He therefore excluded the respondent from the
    list of officials for approval when that list was submitted to the Commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Barr subsequently informed the respondent that the Commission had advised
    him that he would not be approved and that, as a result, he would not be
    able to re-hire him for the new season.  He informed the respondent by letter
    that he had the “intention to re-hire” him for the new season but that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>…as a result of a <i>directive</i> from the Ontario Racing Commission that
    instructed Rideau Carleton Raceway they would not approve Mr. O’Dwyer for
    the position, we were forced to seek the assistance of a new Starter. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    being advised of the Commission’s “directive”, the respondent telephoned
    Mr. Fines and explained that the horse in question was owned by his step-daughter.  He
    later faxed Mr. Fines the bill of sale for the horse, proof of ownership
    of the horse by his step-daughter and other documents supporting his position
    that he was not the owner.  The Commission did not provide the respondent
    with a response to his apparent efforts to challenge the Commission’s decision
    to refuse his approval.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commission’s lack of response to the respondent’s inquiries continued for
    months until the respondent hired a lawyer in December 2003, who made further
    inquiries of the Commission.  Although the correspondence from the respondent’s
    solicitor did, at times, confuse the licensing of the respondent with the
    approval of the respondent as a starter, the purpose of the complaint is
    nonetheless clear.  The respondent wanted Mr. Fines’ decision reversed.  He
    wanted to be approved as a starter for the Rideau-Carlton Raceway’s 2003
    season.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    correspondence with the respondent’s counsel, the Commission’s senior legal
    counsel maintained that no decision had been made respecting the respondent’s
    status as a starter.  Instead, Commission counsel communicated that the Commission
    was not, at that time, inclined to approve the respondent should the Rideau-Carlton
    Raceway propose him as a starter.<b>  </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s solicitor then sought to obtain the Commission’s reasons for
    refusing to consider the respondent’s request to be approved as a starter.  The
    Commission did not provide reasons, maintaining that no “decision” had been
    made as no raceway operator had requested that the respondent be approved
    as a starter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    this period of correspondence, the respondent was prohibited from returning
    to his employment at the raceway.  Finally, in April 2005, likely out of
    frustration from the dismissive position adopted by the Commission, the respondent
    issued his Superior Court action alleging liability for the torts of misfeasance
    in public office and intentional interference with economic relations.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a

    reviewing the audio-taped interviews conducted in relation to the February
    2003 investigation, the trial judge concluded that
    “there was no case against Tom O’Dwyer”, and that the evidence supporting
    the allegations of the hidden ownership of the horse was “woefully lacking”.  He
    further determined that, because no steps were ever taken against the respondent
    and others allegedly involved, the Commission members who received the investigation
    report must have reached the same conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the Commission’s submission that the action was subject
    to a limitation period under the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38.  In this respect, he determined that Mr. Fines’ telephone
    call to Mr. Barr constituted a “private act” affecting only the respondent.  The
    trial judge found additional support for this conclusion by reference to
    the misconduct of the Commission, noting that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>In the final analysis, it would be shameful to impose a limitation period
    against Tom O’Dwyer given the duplicitous conduct on the part of the Ontario
    Racing Commission.  He was essentially left to hang out and dry.</p>

line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    further determined that, even if Mr. Fines’ call could be characterized as
    a “public act”, the limitation period did not begin to run until the respondent’s
    solicitor received the letter from the Commission July 7, 2004, which stated
    that no decision respecting approval of the respondent had been made.  By
    January 1, 2004, a new two year limitation period was in effect pursuant
    to the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, and the respondent
    issued his claim within this time limit.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge went on to find that the respondent was not barred from suing
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Superior Court of Justice simply because remedies were available under the <i>Racing
    Commission Act, 2002</i>.   He reviewed s. 11(7) of the <i>Act, </i>which
    provides, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…a person who considers oneself aggrieved by a decision of a
    person to whom the Commission has delegated a power under subsection (3)…is
    entitled to a hearing by the Commission…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>He determined that this provision did not have application because no decision
    had been made by “a person to whom the Commission has delegated power under
    subsection (3)”.  He further determined that even if the respondent could
    compel a hearing pursuant to s.&nbsp;11(7), he was not foreclosed from pursuing
    a Superior Court action for damages since the Commission’s powers do not
    extend to the authority to order payment of damages.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing the tort of misfeasance in public office, the trial judge reviewed
    the essential elements of the tort as described in <i>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, </i>[2003]
    3 S.C.R. 263 at paras. 22-28, and concluded that all required elements had
    been satisfied on the facts of this case.  In reaching this conclusion, he
    noted the following at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>On the facts of this case I conclude that Bill Fines has … acted with knowledge
    that he had no power to do the act complained of and that the act was likely
    to injure Tom O'Dwyer. …[H]e committed an intentional illegal act by acting
    with reckless indifference or willful blindness of his lack of statutory
    authority to make the telephone call that he did and that he had actual knowledge
    that harm would result or he was recklessly indifferent or willfully blind
    to the harm which resulted. There was no statutory authority for his preemptive
    conduct. It effectively precluded Tom O'Dwyer from the right to a hearing.
    It was patently obvious that his telephone call would result in Tom O'Dwyer's
    loss of employment. Mr. Fines acted as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner
    in relation to Tom O'Dwyer. His conduct exhibited a stunning insensitivity
    to Tom O'Dwyer's rights.</p>

'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    telephone call was not an “illegal act”.  The governing legislation provides
    that a starter must be approved by the Commission and permits communications
    between the raceway and the regulator about regulatory matters.  The trial
    judge’s decision threatens the ability of the regulator to effectively govern
    the industry by labelling informal communications about pending regulatory
    applications as “unlawful”.  </p>

'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    finding that the call deprived the respondent of a right to a hearing was
    based on the licensing provisions of the <i>Act</i>, which are irrelevant
    to and independent of the administrative approval process in issue here.  Since

    been a starter at the Rideau-Carlton Raceway for the previous season.  Mr.
    Fines was also aware that the raceway was two weeks late in submitting its

    accordance with the Supreme Court decision in <i>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</i> at
    para. 22, the<i> </i>tort of misfeasance in public office can arise in one
    of two ways.  It may arise by conduct that is “specifically intended to injure
    a person or class of persons”, referred to as “Category A”.  Alternatively,
    it may arise where a public officer acts “with knowledge both that she or
    he has no power to do the act complained of and that the act is likely to
    injure the plaintiff”, referred to as “Category B”.  In either case, the
    essential elements that must be established include: (1) deliberate and unlawful
    conduct in the exercise of public functions, and (2) awareness that the conduct
    is unlawful and likely to injure the plaintiff: <i>Odhavji </i>at para. 23.  The
    distinguishing features between the two categories of the tort were described
    by Iacobucci J. in <i>Odhavji </i>at para. 23 in this way:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>What distinguishes one form of misfeasance in a public office from the
    other is the manner in which the plaintiff proves each ingredient of the
    tort. In Category B, the plaintiff must prove the two ingredients of the
    tort independently of one another. In Category A, the fact that the public
    officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the plaintiff is sufficient
    to satisfy each ingredient of the tort, owing to the fact that a public officer
    does not have the authority to exercise his or her powers for an improper
    purpose, such as deliberately harming a member of the public. In each instance,
    the tort involves deliberate disregard of official duty coupled with knowledge
    that the misconduct is likely to injure the plaintiff.</p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the nature of the misconduct, the focus of the inquiry is on whether
    the alleged misconduct is deliberate and unlawful.  As noted in <i>Odhavji</i> at
    para. 24, “[t]his may arise from a straightforward breach of the relevant
    statutory provisions or from acting in excess of the powers granted or for
    an improper purpose.”  Importantly, the defendant must have been aware that
    his conduct was unlawful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    state of mind required to establish liability depends on which category the
    tort falls into.  Category A involves “targeted malice”, whereas the requirement
    of intentional misconduct for Category B may be satisfied by “reckless indifference
    as to the legality of the act or its probable consequences.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    misconduct”. </p>

    to acknowledge the existence of such a decision and provide the respondent
    with his statutory entitlement to a hearing.  This position was maintained
    for months despite clear efforts by the respondent to have the decision of
    Mr. Fines challenged and reviewed by contacting Mr. Fines directly to explain

    in unhelpful and misleading correspondence in response to the respondent’s

    conduct of those officials involved in the respondent’s case, namely, Mr.

line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision in <i>Allen v. Flood</i> and the tort of intentional interference
    with economic relations was reviewed more recently in the House of Lords
    decision in <i>OBG Ltd. v. Allan,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Douglas v. Hello! Ltd., </i>and <i>Mainstream Properties Ltd. v. Young</i>,
    [2007] UKHL 21 [<i>OBG</i>].  In that case at para. 46, the rationale for
    the tort as described in <i>Quinn v. Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, 534-35 was
    set out as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[A] person’s liberty or right to deal with others is nugatory, unless they
    are at liberty to deal with him if they choose to do so.  Any interference
    with their liberty to deal with him affects him.  If such interference is
    justifiable in point of law, he has no redress.  Again, if such interference
    is wrongful, the only person who can sue in respect of it is, as a rule,
    the person immediately affected by it; another who suffers by it has usually
    no redress; the damage to him is too remote, and it would be obviously practically
    impossible and highly inconvenient to give legal redress to all who suffer
    from such wrongs.  But if the interference is wrongful and is intended to
    damage a third person, and he is damaged in fact – in other words, if he
    is wrongfully and intentionally struck at through others, if he is thereby
    damnified – the whole aspect of the case is changed: the wrong done to others
    reaches him, his rights are infringed although indirectly, and damage to
    him is not remote or unforeseen, but is the direct consequence of what has
    been done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    historical basis for the tort has therefore involved some form of wrongful
    interference with a third party which is intended to cause economic loss
    to the plaintiff.  This was confirmed in <i>OBG</i> through the statement
    of Lord Hoffman who provided at para. 47:
    “The essence of the tort therefore appears to be (a) a wrongful interference
    with the actions of a third party in which the claimant has an economic interest
    and (b) an intention thereby to cause loss to the claimant.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the “third party” is the raceway.  The difficulty however, is
    that no wrongful interference was procured against the actions of the raceway.  The
    phone call and the decision not to approve the respondent as a starter were,
    for the reasons already described, entirely legitimate in the circumstances.  <span lang=EN-US>I
    have instead concluded that the Commission acted with reckless indifference
    as to the legality of its authority to make a decision while depriving the
    respondent</span> of his statutory right to challenge the decision and <span lang=EN-US>that
    the Commission was </span>subjectively reckless or wilfully blind to the
    harm it would cause to the respondent.  Thus, the circumstances necessary
    to make out the tort of intentional interference with economic relations
    are not present in this case.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span lang=EN-US>4.  Application

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the trial judge found that the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i> did
    not apply because “the act undertaken by Bill Fines was private and affected
    only [the respondent].”  Whether the trial judge’s conclusion on this point
    was proper need not be decided in this case in light of his alternative determination
    respecting the application of the limitation period under the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the limitation period did not begin to run until the
    respondent’s solicitor received a letter from the Commission dated July 7,
    2004, which reiterated that no decision had been made by the Commission respecting
    the respondent.  As the claim was issued in April 2005, this fell within
    the two year limitation period established pursuant to the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have concluded that the tort of misfeasance in public office was established
    on the basis of the combined actions of Mr. Fines and the Commission’s refusal
    to provide the respondent with a hearing pursuant to s. 11(7).  Thus, the
    appellant’s July 7, 2004 letter is a continuation of the tort and the limitation
    period would not begin to run until that date at the earliest.  Therefore,
    the claim is not statute-barred.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the respondent suffered damages as a result of
    the actions of the Commission.  Although not explicitly addressed, it is
    apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that he concluded that the information
    provided by the respondent to Mr. Fines had adequately responded to the concerns
    raised.  There was, therefore, no basis for Mr. Fines’ continuing refusal
    to allow the respondent to act as a starter for the Rideau-Carlton Raceway.  If
    Fines’ decision had been subject to a hearing in accordance with the statute,
    a review of that decision, with the benefit of additional information, would
    have resulted in the respondent being absolved of any misconduct.  It is
    reasonable to conclude that the Rideau-Carlton Raceway would have rehired
    the respondent as a starter soon thereafter given that it had informed him
    that it had the “intention to re-hire” him before the decision to refuse
    his approval was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge assessed global damages at $69,148.  This sum represented primarily
    an estimate of the amount the respondent would have earned if he had worked
    as a starter for the raceway between 2003 and 2005.  The award was ultimately
    reduced to $50,000, that being the maximum allowed for claims brought pursuant
    to Rule 76 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have adopted a different route than the trial judge in reaching the conclusion
    that the appellant is liable in tort for abuse of public office.  I have
    also found that the trial judge erred in imposing liability for inducing
    breach of contract and intentional interference with economic relations.  However,
    the trial judge’s assessment of damages does not represent a cumulative assessment
    on the basis of each tort; rather, the analysis seems to turn purely on the
    assessment of the damage suffered as a result of the exclusion from employment
    and the humiliation and embarrassment occasioned by the Commission.  Thus,
    I see no reason to depart from the amount of damages assessed by the trial
    judge in this case. </p>

    between the nature and purpose of the tort of misfeasance in public office,
    which is directed towards the performance of public duties, as contrasted
    against intentional interference with economic relations, which appears to
    be directed largely towards private interests.  The distinction between these
    two torts has yet to be clearly defined within Canadian law.  Other jurisdictions
    have, however, suggested that misfeasance in public office is a distinct
    tort that should not be subsumed in some wider economic tort, such as intentional
    interference with economic relations:  See <i>Sanders v. Snell</i> [1998]
