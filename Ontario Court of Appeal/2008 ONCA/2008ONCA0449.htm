line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises a difficult issue in relation to the
    Crown’s right to seek a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of
    mental disorder (“NCRMD”).  The history of
    the case is not something of which the administration of justice can be proud.  The appellant has been in custody for almost
    ten years.  Throughout that ten-year
    period, he has been the subject of many psychiatric assessments and embroiled
    in a complex series of trials, mistrials, and appeals, none of which have
    brought this matter to a satisfactory resolution.  The appellant has, for the most part, refused
    legal assistance.  He has consistently
    refused to raise the NCRMD defence despite evidence that would support it. Due
    to a misunderstanding of the law, the trial Crown failed to ask for a verdict
    of NCRMD.  It is because the appellant’s
    appeal questions the conviction that the Crown can now ask us to impose a
    verdict of NCRMD.  As a result, we must
    consider the appropriateness of imposing a declaration of NCRMD against the
    appellant’s wishes and after he has served a significant portion of his maximum
    fourteen-year sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of attempted murder and
    assault with a weapon in 1999 and sentenced in 2000 to twenty-five years
    imprisonment.  In 2001, this court heard
    his appeal from conviction.  After
    ordering a psychiatric assessment, this court allowed the appeal on the ground
    that the appellant was not fit to stand trial, as well as on the ground that
    the appellant had been denied his right to challenge jurors for cause.  The appellant was found unfit to stand trial
    in 2002 by a trial judge, but in 2003, this court allowed an appeal from that
    finding on the ground that the issue of fitness had to be determined by a jury.
     Two attempts to retry the case then resulted
    in mistrials. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The retrial was finally completed in 2006.  The appellant refused to advance the NCRMD
    defence.  The Crown had in its possession
    evidence to support an NCRMD verdict but failed to advance the issue because of
    the trial Crown’s apparent misunderstanding of the applicable law.  The appellant was acquitted of attempted
    murder but convicted of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon, and
    sentenced to the maximum sentence of fourteen years for aggravated assault, and
    two years concurrent for assault with a weapon, with no credit given for
    pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals both conviction and sentence.  The Crown concedes that the appellant should
    have been given credit for the nearly eight years he spent in pre-trial custody
    and that his sentence should therefore be reduced to one of six years, leaving
    him four years to serve.  However, his
    conviction appeal opens the door for the Crown to seek to introduce as fresh
    evidence the psychiatric reports from experts who examined the appellant
    immediately after his first trial in 2000, and to ask us to find the appellant
    NCRMD.  The appellant insists that he be
    given a new trial, while <i>amicus curiae</i> submits that the appropriate order is to admit the Crown’s “fresh” evidence and
    set aside the convictions, but stay all other proceedings on these charges on the
    grounds of abuse of process.  With
    respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant, supported by <i>amicus</i>, argues that he should be given
    two-for-one credit for pre-trial custody, which would effectively mean that his
    entire fourteen year sentence has been served.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would grant the Crown’s
    request to introduce fresh evidence, set aside the appellant’s conviction, and substitute
    a verdict of NCRMD.  In my view, the
    appellant’s grounds for challenging his conviction lack merit.  I am unable to accept the thoughtful and
    helpful submission of <i>amicus</i> that we
    should permit the Crown to introduce its fresh evidence of NCRMD, yet stay
    further proceedings on the grounds that they would constitute an abuse of
    process.  There is no evidence of malice
    or intentional misconduct on the part of the Crown.  Any failings on the part of the Crown in this
    matter have been inadvertent and exacerbated by the difficulties involved in
    dealing with a seriously mentally ill defendant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only basis for interfering with the appellant’s
    conviction arises from the evidence that the appellant is NCRMD.  On the well-established principle that it can
    never be in a defendant’s interest to be wrongly convicted, I would hold that
    it is not an abuse of process for the Crown to seek to reverse a wrongful
    conviction by substituting a verdict of NCRMD.  Furthermore, given the significant public
    interest reasons in favour of permitting a NCRMD verdict to take its full
    effect in the present circumstances, this case is not among those clearest of
    cases that would justify imposing a stay.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged in September 1998 with
    attempted murder and assault with a weapon for using a specially weighted cane
    to severely beat Wayne Thomson, then the Mayor of Niagara Falls, and for threatening
    Dean Iorfida, the aide who helped the Mayor escape.  Mayor Thomson suffered serious physical and
    psychological injuries as a result of the attack. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had no prior criminal record.  The charges against him arose from conduct
    prompted by his delusional belief in a conspiracy surrounding his father’s
    death and the disposition of his father’s estate.  He was arrested shortly after the attack and
    gave a statement to the police explaining and justifying his vicious assault on
    the Mayor on the ground that a number of parties, including the Mayor, the
    appellant’s siblings, organized crime, and the courts, had conspired to murder
    his father and to subvert his father’s will.  For much of the time from his arrest to the
    present, the appellant has insisted on representing himself in the plethora of
    legal proceedings he has faced, and has either had an antagonistic relationship
    or entirely refused to communicate with counsel and <i>amicus</i> appointed to represent or assist him and the court, as he
    believes that lawyers are part of the conspiracy oppressing him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s father died in 1990 at the age of eighty-four
    from natural causes. He had previously divided real estate he owned among
    several of his children, including the appellant, but had not attempted to
    sever the land into lots or to comply with zoning laws.  Following the appellant’s father’s death, the
    probate court accordingly adjusted the disposition of the property to take the
    zoning laws into account.  The
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls municipal council – then presided over by
    Mayor Thomson – approved this adjustment.  All of the Pietrangelo children supported
    these proceedings, with the exception of the appellant.  The appellant’s brother Gino, executor of the
    estate, obtained a court order on September 1, 1998, giving him exclusive
    possession of the property and permitting him to effect a sale.  On the same day, the appellant visited Mayor
    Thomson at his offices and proceeded to attack him and his assistant.  The appellant was arrested shortly thereafter.</p>

  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i) Preliminary Inquiry</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the preliminary inquiry, the appellant’s
    psychological condition was evaluated by Dr. G.A. Chaimowitz, Clinical Director
    and Forensic Psychiatrist at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Hamilton
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Psychiatric Hospital, who
    provided a report to the court indicating that the appellant was afflicted with
    a major mental disorder, most likely delusional disorder or paranoid
    schizophrenia.  Dr. Chaimowitz expressed
    the opinion that the appellant would be unable to participate meaningfully in a
    criminal trial on account of his delusions, as he was “unaware of the real
    issues facing him and show[ed] no insight into his own particular situation
    with respect to the court room.”  Counsel
    was appointed to assist the appellant on the fitness hearing.  Dr. Chaimowitz testified that he believed that
    the appellant suffered from delusional disorder and non-bizarre fixed false
    beliefs; in other words, beliefs in facts that can occur in real life but that
    are false and impervious to reason.  He also
    testified that the appellant’s attack on the mayor was driven by his delusional
    beliefs and that those beliefs prevented him from understanding the purpose of
    the criminal proceedings against him, which he perceived as a device that would
    permit him to uncover and expose the “conspiracy.”  The Crown argued that the appellant was unfit,
    while the appellant submitted that he was fit.  The preliminary inquiry judge found that the
    appellant was fit and committed him for trial.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii) First Trial</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s first trial took place in September
    1999 before a Superior Court judge and jury.  The appellant insisted on representing
    himself, but did not cross-examine any of the Crown’s witnesses, call any
    defence witnesses, or make closing submissions. As this court later observed on
    appeal, “[t]he trial was a difficult one … and throughout the trial [the
    appellant] displayed substantial signs of significant mental illness”: <i>R. v. Pietrangelo</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C.
    (3d) 475 at para. 3.  The jury found the
    appellant guilty on both counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the verdict was received and the convictions were
    entered, but prior to sentencing, the trial judge ordered a psychiatric
    assessment.  In January 2000, Dr.
    Chaimowitz rendered an opinion confirming the diagnosis of delusional disorder
    and indicating that although the appellant appeared to understand the nature of
    the charges and the consequences of the trial proceedings, he remained
    delusional.  He had agreed to take
    antipsychotic medication.  However,
    disorders of this kind are slow to respond to treatment and medications had not
    alleviated the appellant’s delusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Chaimowitz also stated that the appellant’s
    delusional disorder had prevented him from knowing that his attack on the Mayor
    was morally wrong: the “righting” of his father’s will was the only important
    issue for him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Chaimowitz subsequently provided the Crown with a
    clarifying report confirming his opinion that the appellant was not criminally
    responsible for the offences at issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Mr. Pietrangelo appeared to be suffering from
    his Delusional Disorder at the time of the offence and was clearly not
    perceiving reality in the way that a non-psychotic person would. … [A]lthough
    Mr. Pietrangelo would have known what he was doing when he striking the victim,
    his overriding convictions as part of his delusions certainly did not allow him
    to appreciate the full scope and the consequences of his actions. … Mr.
    Pietrangelo felt persecuted by a conspiracy that involved infiltration of
    international organized crime. Striking the Mayor, in his mind, was not
    striking the Mayor as a non-delusional person would. Mr. Pietrangelo appeared
    to … believe that at the time the Mayor was part of that conspiracy and thus he
    did not appreciate the objective circumstances surrounding the situation. His
    raising of the cane and striking the victim followed naturally from his delusional
    views of his father’s will.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… Mr.
    Pietrangelo had a belief system that overrode any sense that he was morally
    wrong in whatever he did to “right” his father’s will. The   of
    legal wrongfulness is a little different.  He is now able to say that Assault and Attempted
    Murder [are] illegal, but has at times referred to “no higher law than honoring
    your father’s will”.  Thus, in my
    opinion, he was not aware of the moral wrongfulness and may have not have been
    aware of the legal wrongfulness [at] the time of the act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Thus, in my opinion, it may be
    interpreted that although he knew that he was striking someone he did not
    appreciate the nature and quality of his actions nor know that this was wrong.
    In his mind, the supporting and defending of his father’s will superseded any
    other laws. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel provided the psychiatric report to the
    trial judge, stating that he felt that he had an obligation to raise the NCRMD
    issue, but acknowledged that the court might not have the jurisdiction to
    consider it, as the jury had been discharged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By this point, appellant had counsel to represent him
    on the sentencing hearing and on the appeal that followed.  Defence counsel agreed that it was too late for
    the trial judge to re-open the verdict to consider the NCRMD issue because the
    jury had been discharged, but argued that the proper remedy was a mistrial.  The trial judge agreed that he was <i>functus officio</i> with regard to the
    verdict and without jurisdiction to deal with the NCRMD issue.  He declined, however, to grant defence
    counsel’s request to declare a mistrial, and suggested that the parties could
    raise this issue on appeal.  The trial
    judge also offered to grant an adjournment to permit both parties to call
    further psychiatric evidence to create a record for the Court of Appeal.  Defence counsel declined this offer, stating
    that it had disclaimed any reliance on a defence of NCRMD and that it would
    therefore be inappropriate to call evidence on this point. </p>

    ground of relief. Prior to oral argument, this court ordered a psychiatric
    assessment at the Crown’s request. </p>

    interfered with his ability to understand the purpose of the criminal
    proceedings.  According to Dr. Bradford,
    the appellant did not perceive their purpose to be to criminally prosecute him for
    attempted murder, but rather as affording him the opportunity to expose the
    conspiracy and corruption that prevented the execution of his father’s “true will”.</p>

    appellant was able to appreciate the physical nature and quality of his
    actions, and that his actions were legally wrong, his delusional disorder led
    him to believe that his attack on the Mayor was morally justified. Dr. Bradford
    concluded that this brought the appellant within the s.&nbsp;16(1) defence of
    NCRMD:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    Pietrangelo had a strong delusional belief that his behaviour in attacking the

    argument that he had been denied his statutory right to challenge jurors for
    cause.  The court also agreed with the Crown’s
    argument that the appellant was unfit to stand trial.  The court found that the trial judge had erred
    in proceeding with the trial in the face of the appellant’s abnormal behaviour,
    which indicated that he did not understand the nature and object of the
    proceedings.  The trial judge should have
    directed that the issue of the appellant’s fitness be tried and appointed
    counsel to represent the appellant pursuant to s. 672.24 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This court’s opinion stated, at para.16, that
    Dr. Bradford’s report made it “clear in unequivocal terms that the appellant is
    presently unfit to stand trial, unable to understand the nature and object of
    the proceedings and in need of treatment with anti-psychotic medication in
    order to be rendered fit.”  The

    Crown’s request to find the appellant unfit, but the court made a finding of
    unfitness and remitted the matter to the Ontario Review Board (“ORB”) for

    the time of the offence did not appreciate the nature and quality of his acts

    order “is of such intensity that it interferes with his ability to appreciate
    the wrongfulness of his behaviour that, to his delusional point of view, was
    justified.”  They also expressed the view
    that the appellant had no insight into his illness or need for treatment, and
    that he was “extremely unlikely” to take medication to ameliorate his major
    mental disorder, for which he was not at that time receiving treatment.  They stated that although the appellant’s

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    the opinions of Drs. Chaimowitz and Bradford to the effect that the appellant
    had a NCRMD defence.  He relied on the
    evidence from Dr. Chaimowitz as to the appellant’s risk of further violence.  The trial judge also noted that Dr. Chaimowitz
    had testified at the sentencing hearing that the appellant could act violently
    against anyone whom he perceived as standing in the way of righting his

    absolute.  The court identified two
    important objectives capable of grounding a s. 1 <i>Charter </i>limitation on the s. 7 right of the accused.  First, the court at p. 509 refers to “the
    principle of fundamental justice that the criminal justice system not convict a

    altered to permit the Crown to raise NCRMD in two situations.  First, when the accused puts his or her mental
    capacity for criminal intent into question, the Crown is entitled to lead
    evidence of insanity to provide the trier of fact with a complete picture.  Second, once the trier of fact has made a
    finding of guilt, but before a conviction is entered, the Crown may lead
    evidence to show that the appellant should be found NCRMD.  Postponing the introduction of the NCRMD issue
    until after there has been a finding of guilt preserves the s. 7 right of the
    accused to make fundamental decisions about the conduct of his or her defence against
    a criminal charge. However, once there has been a finding of guilt, the Supreme
    Court held that it is a reasonable limitation on the rights of the accused to
    permit the Crown to introduce the issue of NCRMD to satisfy the dual objectives
    of preventing the justice system from labelling the insane as criminals, and
    protecting the public from individuals who pose a risk to society and who
    require treatment. </p>

    the trial Crown deliberately refrained from raising the NCRMD issue for any

    failure to raise the NCRMD issue appears to have entirely arisen from a
    misreading or misunderstanding of the effect of <i>Swain</i>.</p>

    the principle that permits the court to admit fresh evidence in criminal cases,
    which was applied in <i>Warsing</i>, <i>supra </i>at paras. 50–56 – namely, that
    “failure to meet the due diligence requirement should not override
    accomplishing a just result”: <i>id.</i> at

    Doherty J.A. stated that “evidence which satisfies the Court of appeal that the

    available at trial.”  See also <i>R. v. B. (G.D.)</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. 289
    at para. 19 (S.C.C.).  The fresh evidence
    at issue in the present case falls into this category and, despite its availability
    at trial, its admission is justified to maintain the fundamental principle of
    the justice system that no individual who was not criminally responsible for
    his acts when he committed an offence should be saddled with a criminal
    conviction.</p>

    not required to give rise to a finding of abuse of process: see <i>R. v. Keyowski</i> (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 at 483 (S.C.C.). I therefore turn to the question of whether entering a

    community’s sense of fair play and decency”? <i>Amicus</i> submits that unfairness to the appellant arises from the
    fact that the Crown asks for a NCRMD verdict after ten years of legal
    proceedings and the appellant’s completion of a significant portion of his
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s request for an NCRMD finding at this stage must
    be placed in context.  The Crown did not
    have evidence of NCRMD until after the jury was discharged at the first trial
    in 1998.  As soon as it had that evidence,
    the Crown asked the trial judge to consider it, a request that was resisted by
    the appellant and rejected by the trial judge on the ground that the jury had
    been discharged.  The Crown appropriately
    proposed a finding of NCRMD as an alternative resolution to the appeal that
    this court heard in 2001.  However, as
    the court had to set aside the appellant’s conviction and order a new trial on
    the basis of the trial judge’s denial of his right to challenge jurors for
    cause and on the basis that he was unfit to stand trial, it could not deal with
    the NCRMD issue.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the time of that appeal and the commencement of
    the retrial in 2006, the issue of fitness to stand trial remained unresolved
    and, accordingly, there was no opportunity for the Crown to raise NCRMD.  Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <i>Swain</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Crown’s first opportunity to
    raise the issue of NCRMD following the 2001 appeal was at the 2006 trial after the
    jury returned its guilty verdict and before a conviction was entered.  This appeal has proceeded with appropriate
    dispatch, taking into consideration the problems posed by the appellant’s
    attitude towards legal representation and the participation of <i>amicus</i>.  Thus, while we must not lose sight of the fact
    that there has been an unfortunate delay in raising NCRMD, this is an appeal
    from a trial that took place two years ago at which the issue almost certainly
    could have been raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another important fact bearing upon the significance of
    the ten-year delay and the extent of the prejudice the delay may have caused to
    the appellant is that the appellant’s fitness was at issue for much of the time
    from his arrest in 1998 until his trial and conviction in 2006.  As a consequence, he was detained in
    psychiatric facilities for a significant portion of the period, much as he
    would have been detained had the Crown successfully raised NCRMD in a more
    timely fashion. </p>

    new trial and enter a stay.  The <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 686(1)(d), “clearly
    contemplates a court of appeal making a determination on the issue of NCRMD”,
    and “[i]t is only in cases where the facts are complex and the court concludes
    that further evidence is required that a new trial would be ordered”: <i>Warsing, supra</i> at paras. 64, 65.  In <i>R. v.
    M. (I.E.)</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 515 at para. 46, this court stated that
    when the issue is raised for the first time on appeal and the appeal succeeds, making
    an NCRMD finding – rather than ordering a new trial – is the “presumptive
    course”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that the interests of justice would be
    served by ordering a new trial.  There is
    no doubt on the record that, if not for the issue of NCRMD, the appellant would
    be guilty of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  Before us, the appellant expressed a strong
    wish to have a new trial, but I see no hope that if a new trial were ordered,
    the appellant would be willing or able to focus on the only outstanding legal
    issue – namely, the issue of NCRMD.  There
    is no evidence to challenge the psychiatric evidence that brings the appellant
    squarely within the NCRMD defence.  The
    appellant and <i>amicus</i> have been
    accorded full opportunity to cross-examine Drs. Chaimowitz and Bradford. The only
    psychiatric evidence before this court remains unshaken.  </p>

    nature of the evidence now before us and the manner in which the appellant has
    conducted himself throughout, I can see no realistic prospect that a different
    picture would emerge on the NCRMD issue if he were accorded a new trial. </p>

line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am therefore not persuaded that we should circumvent
    what appears to be an inevitable result by allowing the appeal, declining to
    make an NCRMD finding, but ordering a new trial.  The evidence establishes that the appellant is
    NCRMD and we should squarely face the issue of whether an NCRMD verdict at this
    stage would amount to an abuse of process. </p>

    one ground upon which we can and must set aside the convictions; namely, there
    is compelling evidence that shows that the appellant is NCRMD.  However unfortunate it may be that the justice
    system has taken ten years to arrive at this result, in the circumstances of
    this case, I do not think it would be appropriate for us, under the guise of the
    doctrine of abuse of process, to attempt to avoid the legal consequences that

    recognize that if a stay were entered, the interest of protection of the public
    could be addressed through the process of civil committal pursuant to the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;M.7.
     Dr. Bradford testified that the
    appellant was “most likely” certifiable under that legislation.  However, Dr. Bradford also testified that the
    civil committal procedure works best with individuals who suffer from acute
    psychiatric conditions that are relatively easy to treat and who require
    relatively short periods of institutionalization.  In Dr. Bradford’s view, the appellant does not
    fit in this category, as his condition is difficult to treat and he is likely
    to require a relatively longer period of institutionalization.  It was Dr. Bradford’s view that in the
    appellant’s case, an NCRMD disposition that would place the appellant under the
    ORB regime was more appropriate both for the appellant and for the public. </span></p>

    agree with Dr. Bradford’s assessment.  Given
    the nature of the appellant’s illness, his poor prospects for successful
    treatment, and the risk he poses to the public, he is likely to be held for a
    significant period of time regardless of whether he is civilly committed or
    designated NCRMD.  The ORB regime is designed
    to deal with dangerous individuals who have committed violent acts because of
    chronic and severe mental illness, and specifically addresses the need to
    balance the rights of the individual against the need to protect the public.  It is not at all clear that in the
    circumstances of this case, such a balance could be as appropriately achieved
    under the <i>Mental Heath Act</i>’s civil
    committal regime. </span></p>
