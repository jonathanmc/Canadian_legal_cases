line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is a lawyer who represented Mr. Rizzuto
    in his attempt to purchase the property of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rizzuto wanted the property for development. He
    approached the appellant together with her husband about the possibility of
    purchasing the property. Through his real estate agent, Mr. Durbano, he made a
    written offer to purchase the property, which Mr. Durbano delivered to the
    Footmans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After considering the offer, the Footmans contacted Mr.
    Durbano and told him they would be willing to sell, but for a higher price and
    as long as they could live on the property rent-free for three years after
    closing. Mr. Durbano typed up a sign-back with these terms, had it initialled
    by Mrs. Footman and delivered it to Mr. Rizzuto on Sept 1, 2000. The sign-back
    was irrevocable until September 6 at 5:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rizzuto was content with the new price but was
    concerned about the three-year occupancy period. He asked Mr. Durbano to
    contact the Footmans and see whether, instead of three years’ occupancy, they
    would accept six months or one year occupancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were at least two telephone conversations between
    Mr. Durbano and Mr.&nbsp;Footman but they disagreed about what was discussed
    and agreed. The trial judge found that there was a misunderstanding between
    them on the occupancy issue but that “the Footman’s position prevailed as there
    is no doubt that the Footman offer with a three-year occupancy clause remained
    outstanding and open for acceptance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Durbano reported to Mr. Rizzuto that the Footmans
    were prepared to accept a one-year occupancy. However, Mr. Rizzuto did not want
    to risk jeopardizing the deal by signing back the Footmans’ offer so instructed
    Mr. Durbano that he would accept their offer, but that Mr. Durbano should
    continue to explore a one-year occupancy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he was unable to arrange a meeting with Mrs.
    Footman, Mr. Durbano followed Mr. Rizzuto’s instructions by delivering to the
    Footman residence before 5:00&nbsp;p.m. on September 6, the Footman offer fully
    signed by Mr. Pyne in trust, but enclosed a covering letter which read as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dear Mr. and
    Mrs. Footman,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Enclosed please
    find accepted Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale
    for your property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>As discussed and agreed to yesterday, the
    period that you would be staying on the property would be for one (1) year
    after closing. Accordingly, please find Amendment to Agreement for your
    signature.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I will drop
    these documents in your mail-box today, as directed by Mr. Footman this morning
    at 9:40 a.m., as he informed me that Mrs. Footman is not available until
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I would like to
    take this opportunity to thank you for allowing me in your home and taking part
    in the sale of your property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An amending agreement signed by the respondent was
    enclosed in triplicate that removed the three-year occupancy, substituted one
    year, and imposed a physical restriction on the area to be used. No
    consideration was suggested for the amendment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant took the position that there was no
    agreement and refused to close the transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue before the trial judge was whether the respondent
    had clearly and unequivocally accepted the appellant’s sign-back offer. He
    found that he had. The trial judge concluded that based on the telephone
    conversations between Mr. Durbano and Mr.&nbsp;Footman that preceded the
    delivery of the signed agreement, the letter and the signed amending agreement,
    the Footmans should have understood that they had a deal with the three-year
    occupancy and that the one-year amendment was just an optional proposal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the trial judge, we do not agree that this
    conclusion was available based on the trial judge’s findings and the
    documentary record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken alone, the letter of September 6 could not be
    read as offering an option to the Footmans. It states that the Footmans had
    already agreed to the amendment and presented it for Mrs. Footman’s signature.
    Read fairly, it appears to enclose the signed agreement for the purpose of
    amending it with the signed amending agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The finding by the trial judge that the Footmans should
    have known that they had a deal for three years occupancy based on Mr. Footman’s
    conversations with Mr.&nbsp;Durbano is not consistent with Mr. Durbano’s
    understanding that they had agreed on one year, or with the trial judge’s
    finding that there was a misunderstanding between them on the issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also concluded that if there was any
    confusion, it was Mrs.&nbsp;Footman’s fault for not being available personally
    to receive the accepted offer and an explanation about the intent of the
    amending agreement. This conclusion is wrong in law. The acceptance of the
    offer was made by delivery in writing to the address. There was no obligation
    for Mrs. Footman to be personally available or to receive any explanations.
    Furthermore, this finding on its own refutes the conclusion that the respondent’s
    acceptance of the Footman counter-offer was clear and unequivocal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this case is governed by the Supreme Court
    decision in <i>Harvey v. Perry</i> [1953] 1
    S.C.R. 233, part of the headnote of which says: “The whole of the
    correspondence, interviews and conduct of the parties showed that they had not
    agreed upon the terms of a contract and that the respondent, up to the
    conclusion of the negotiations, was still trying to obtain terms more
    satisfactory to himself.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of our conclusion on the main issue, we do not
    need to address the two other issues raised by the appellant on the appeal,
    relating to the expert evidence at trial and the trial judge’s decision not to
    allow an amendment to the statement of claim mid-trial because of non-compensable
    prejudice to the defendant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed with costs of the appeal fixed at
    $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. Costs of the trial to the
    appellant fixed in accordance with the award made by the trial judge to the
    respondent at $60,000 for fees on the partial indemnity scale, plus
    disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
