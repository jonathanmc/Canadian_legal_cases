  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A cottage owner hired a 13-year-old local boy to
    work as a “boat boy”.  In the course of
    his chores, the boy accidentally caused a fire.  The cottage owner’s insurer paid $285,000 on the resulting claim.  The central question raised by this appeal is
    whether the cottage owner, by way of a subrogated claim brought by the insurer,
    can recover from the boy either in tort or in contract.  The trial judge, Stach J., held that the cottage
    owner cannot and dismissed the claim.  For the reasons that follow, I agree. </p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Bryce Douglas, hired the
    respondent, Mitchell Kinger, as a “boat boy” to perform menial chores at the
    appellant’s cottage during the summer of 2000.  The appellant assigned the respondent tasks to
    be performed using the appellant’s equipment.  The assigned tasks included lawn mowing, raking, removing weeds,
    clearing brush, sweeping walks, cleaning boats, and carrying groceries.  The respondent worked on a part-time basis
    for $8.00 per hour, calculated on the basis of time sheets that he submitted.  While school was in session, he was expected
    to work on Saturdays.  During summer
    vacation, he was expected to work three days a week, for six hours a day.  The respondent also did yard work for his
    family.  In addition, he worked for a
    fast food restaurant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the appellant did not supervise the
    respondent closely, he did set rules.  These
    rules included a prohibition on travelling to the cottage, which was on an
    island, in a small boat or in bad weather.  Another rule specifically prohibited the respondent from using power
    equipment unless an adult was present on the island.  The respondent broke this rule on June 17,
    2000, when he attempted to refuel the appellant’s gas-powered lawn mower while
    alone on the island.  Because he was unsure
    whether the gas can, which was stored in the boathouse, contained enough fuel
    for this purpose, he held a lighted match to the mouth of the can to peer in
    and check the gasoline level.  The flame
    ignited the vapours.  The resulting fire
    burned the appellant’s boathouse and its contents.  The insurance claim was resolved and this lawsuit
    ensued. </p>
  <h2>THE TRIAL DECISION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the respondent did not know that gas
    vapours were flammable, the trial judge found him “negligent” because he did
    know that “bringing an open flame in close proximity to a source of gasoline is
    a danger.”  Thus, the trial judge found
    that the fire was foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In characterizing the nature of the relationship
    between the parties, the trial judge relied on the leading authority<span
style='color:black;'> <span
lang=EN>of </span></span><i>671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries
    Canada Inc., </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R.
    983.  He concluded that the
    respondent was the appellant’s employee, rather than an independent contractor,
    because he was <span lang=EN style='color:black;
'>“singularly unable to find … any factual support for the
    proposition that Mitchell Kinger was an independent contractor”.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge referred to <span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>two cases
    where employees were held liable to employers for negligence:<i> Pinto v. BMO
    Nesbitt Burns Inc.</i> (2005), 40 C.C.E.L. (3d) 293 (Ont. S.C.J.) </span><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>and </span><i><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>Dominion Manufacturers Ltd. v.
    O'Gorman</span></i><span lang=EN style='color:black;'> (1989), 24 C.C.E.L. 218 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Ont. Dist. Ct.).  However, the trial judge </span>distinguished
    those cases from the present situation on the basis that they involved highly skilled <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>employees
    receiving substantial professional income.  He</span> determined that the respondent was an unskilled employee, and
    that unskilled employees are treated differently for necessary and well-founded
    reasons.  Referring to <i><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>Kleinsasser v. Alexander</span></i><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'> (</span><span
lang=EN>1994), 122 Sask. R. 52 (</span><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>Q.B.),
    the trial judge concluded that </span>the terms of the respondent’s employment
    as an unskilled employee did not contemplate liability and, in any event,
    liability was not reasonable in the circumstances.  <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>The trial judge concluded at para. 19 that
    there is “no presumption under Ontario law that an unskilled employee will be
    liable to his employer for negligently caused loss in the workplace.”  He reasoned, at paras. 20-22, that each case
    requires consideration of the individual circumstances and the character of the
    parties’ relationship: </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>The
    circumstances of the hiring need in each case to be considered along with the
    unique character of the employer and the employee.  If, in the case of unskilled employees, there
    is to be an expectation that the employee will be liable for negligently caused
    losses in the workplace, that expectation ought to be set out in the employment
    contract in writing or capable of being unambiguously implied from the
    circumstances.<a name="PNUM_21"></a></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Where an
    unskilled employee is confronted with the expectation that he or she will be
    liable for workplace negligence losses to their employer, that employee ought
    to have the ability to negotiate a higher income to offset the purchase of
    insurance where necessary or to take other appropriate precaution.<a
name="PNUM_22"></a></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>The case
    before me is that of a school boy unskilled, earning - by adult standards - a
    low rate of pay for the performance of mundane chores.  It is not the kind of circumstance, in my
    opinion, that should found liability in substantial amounts for his
    disobedience to the instruction of his employer intended for the child's own
    safety.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the trial judge dismissed the
    appellant’s action on the basis of policy considerations relating to unskilled
    employees that negate the imposition of a duty of care.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s claim is framed both in tort and
    in contract.  I will begin by dealing
    with the appellant’s claim in tort, followed by the appellant’s claim in
    contract.</p>
  <h2>Claim in Tort</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The foundational authority for the law governing
    tort liability is <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>,
    [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.).  Its “neighbour”
    concept, that one owes a duty of care to those whom one may foreseeably injure,
    was considered in <i>Anns v. Merton London
    Borough Council</i>, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.).  In that case, the House of Lords provided an analytical framework for establishing
    a duty of care.  This framework involves a
    two-stage analysis involving proximity and policy considerations.  The Supreme Court of Canada adopted a nuanced <i>Anns</i> test in <i>Kamloops (City of) v. Nielsen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 10-11, which posed two questions: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       is
    there a sufficiently close relationship between the parties to justify the
    imposition of a duty (proximity) and, if so,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)       are
    there any residual policy considerations which ought to negative or limit the
    scope of the duty, the class of persons to whom it is owed or the damages to
    which breach may give rise?</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The plaintiff bears the burden of
    establishing a <i>prima facie</i> duty of
    care; however, if the plaintiff does so, the defendant has the evidentiary
    burden to show countervailing policy considerations: see <i>Childs</i> <i>v. Desormeaux, </i>[2006]
    1 S.C.R. 643 at para. 13.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the later case of <i>Odhavji Estate v.
    Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, was initially seen to adjust the two-stage test, the Supreme Court observed at para. 12 of <i>Childs </i>that <i>Odhavji </i>simply
    clarified that “proximity will not always be satisfied by reasonable
    foreseeability”.  The court explained at
    para. 12 of <i>Childs</i> that “at stage
    one, foreseeability and factors going to the relationship between the parties must
    be considered with a view to determining whether a <i>prima facie</i> duty of
    care arises.”  Stage two of the test inquires
    whether any duty is negated by broader policy considerations beyond the
    relationship between the parties.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two components of the stage one test were
    discussed in <i>Syl Apps Secure Treatment
    Centre v. B.D.</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83.  In
    explaining the purpose for the requirement of sufficient proximity at para. 26,
    Abella J. referred to Allen M. Linden and Bruce Feldthusen’s text, <i>Canadian
    Tort Law</i>, 8th ed. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham: Butterworths,
    2006).  At p. 304 of that text, the
    authors explain that a court must inquire “whether, despite the reasonable
    foresight of harm, it is unjust or unfair to hold the defendant subject to a
    duty because of the absence of any relationship of proximity between the
    plaintiff and the defendant.”  Abella J.
    concluded at para. 30 that “[d]epending on the circumstances of the case, the
    factors to be considered in the proximity analysis include the parties’
    expectations, representations and reliance.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Referring to <i>Cooper
    v. Hobart</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, Abella J. explained at para. 32 what policy
    considerations are relevant at the first and at the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> analysis:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[P]olicy is relevant at both the “proximity” stage
    and the “residual policy concerns” stage<i> </i>of the <i>Anns </i>test.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    difference is that under proximity, the relevant questions of policy relate to
    factors arising from the particular relationship between the plaintiff and the
    defendant.&nbsp; In contrast, residual policy considerations are concerned not
    so much with “the relationship between the parties, but with the effect of
    recognizing a duty of care on other legal obligations, the legal system and
    society more generally” (<i>Cooper</i>, at para. 37).&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To summarize, the first stage of the analysis asks
    whether a duty of care has been established by considering both the
    foreseeability of the harm and the relationship between the parties that would
    make the imposition of a duty unjust or unfair, including any factors arising
    from the relationship such as the parties’ expectations, representations and
    reliance.  Where foreseeability and sufficient
    proximity are established in the first stage of the test, the second stage
    requires a consideration of residual policy factors, including the impact of
    the proposed duty of care on other legal obligations, the legal system, and on
    society generally.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before embarking on the two-stage analysis, the
    Supreme Court instructed in <i>Cooper </i>that
    a court must first determine whether the parties’ relationship falls into a
    category already recognized as giving rise to a duty of care.  If it does, a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care is established and it becomes unnecessary
    to undertake the <i>Anns</i> analysis.  If the case falls outside an established
    category, <i>Anns</i> must be applied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, I begin with the preliminary
    question of whether the relationship between the appellant and the respondent
    in this case falls into a category already recognized as giving rise to a duty
    of care.</p>
  <h3 style='text-align:justify;'>1.         As a preliminary matter, does the
    parties’ relationship fall within a recognized category?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the relationship
    between the parties in this case falls within one of three categories that have
    already been recognized as giving rise to a duty of care:  independent contractors, indemnification in
    situations of employer vicarious liability, and skilled employees.  I find that the relationship in this case
    does not fall into any of these suggested categories.  I will consider each category in turn. </p>
  <h2>            <i>(a)       Was
    the respondent an independent contractor?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in concluding that the respondent was an employee rather than an independent
    contractor.  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is well recognized that the relationship
    between an independent contractor and his or her employer is generally one of
    sufficient proximity to give rise to the imposition of a duty of care.  This duty of care is justified by the nature
    of the relationship: the independent contractor, who is carrying on a business
    on his or her own account, controls the work.  Since the work is under the independent
    contractor’s control, he or she creates the situation of risk and should be
    held responsible for any resulting harm.  As a result, independent contractors are expected to insure or otherwise
    protect against their own negligence.  In
    practice, the independent contractor's liability is often addressed in the
    contract entered into between the parties.<a

    between an employment relationship and an independent contractor relationship
    is <i>Sagaz</i>.  The appellant argues that the trial judge’s findings
    in applying <i>Sagaz</i> were conclusory.  In my view, a fair reading of the entirety of
    the trial judge’s reasons make it clear that his decision was amply supported
    by his factual findings regarding the degree of control the appellant exercised
    over the respondent’s work and the respondent’s corresponding lack of control. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s control is illustrated by the
    following factors: the appellant assigned the respondent’s chores; the
    appellant provided all tools and supplies for the respondent’s work; the
    respondent was not authorized to and did not hire helpers to assist him; the
    respondent undertook no financial risk and he had no opportunity to profit from
    his efforts.  Although the respondent
    also performed yard jobs for others, primarily family members, he was not in
    the business of providing landscaping or caretaker services.  He was a young student who took part-time
    employment to earn spending money.  Looking
    at the relationship as a whole, the respondent was not engaged as a “contractor”
    running an “independent” business on his own account; rather, he was engaged in
    performing the appellant’s work.  Even if
    the appellant did not supervise each chore closely, he had the right to control
    the scope of the respondent’s work and the respondent’s performance.  In this sense, the respondent agreed to a
    contract <i>of</i> service rather than a
    contract <i>for</i> services.  Accordingly, I agree with the trial judge’s finding
    that the respondent was not an independent contractor, but an employee.</p>
  <h2><i>(b)       Was the relationship in this case analogous
    to employee liability in vicarious liability situations?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant analogizes the relationship in
    this case to a situation of vicarious liability.  Vicarious liability, which is essentially a
    form of strict liability, holds an employer liable to a third party for the
    negligent act of the employee.  While the
    concept of vicarious liability is not determinative of whether the employee
    should be liable to indemnify the employer for that liability, negligent
    employees have been held liable on the basis of a common law implied right of
    indemnity: see <i>Creasy v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sudbury
    (

    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Municipality) </i>(1999), 133 O.A.C. 54
    at para. 45.  Whether that right to
    indemnification should apply in all employment contexts apparently has not been
    addressed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the combined application of
    vicarious liability and implied indemnification is not without its difficulties.  First, even assuming that employers generally
    have an implied right of indemnity against employees in vicarious liability
    situations, different policy considerations may well apply where the employer
    is seeking to recover directly from the employee in the absence of a third
    party claim.  Second, in my view, it is
    not settled law that an employee is required to indemnify an employer for its
    vicarious liability in all circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding the first point, different policy
    considerations may apply where an employer has already compensated a third
    party for employee negligence, as opposed to a situation where the employer is
    seeking to recover from the employee in the absence of a third party claim.  Vicarious liability is a legal construct that
    provides a remedy for an injured third party against the employer who created
    the risk and benefited from it, and who can usually best afford to pay
    compensation for the harm that resulted.  This construct was developed in part because it serves the social
    utility of deterring against future harm by encouraging employers to shoulder
    the safety risks posed by their employees and to absorb the cost of employee
    negligence as a cost of doing business.  As
    LaForest J. observed in <i>London Drugs Ltd.
    v. Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd.</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299 at p. 336,
    vicarious liability is best viewed as a response to broader policy concerns
    “linked to compensation, deterrence and loss internalization.”  Thus, the reasons for imposing vicarious
    liability involve the relationship between a business and an injured third
    party; they do not address the relationship between the business and its
    negligent employee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This leads to the second point.  While employers held vicariously liable have succeeded
    in obtaining indemnification from their employees, this right to
    indemnification has been called into question, as I will explain more fully
    later in these reasons.<a href="#_ftn2"

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I do not accept that any
    category arising from vicarious liability and implied indemnification clearly encompasses
    the employee liability situation raised in this case. </p>
  <h2><i>(c)       Was the respondent a skilled employee?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the appellant argues that the
    respondent was a skilled employee in the sense that he held himself out to be
    capable of performing the tasks he was assigned and that, because of that
    skill, he should be required to indemnify his employer for his negligence.  However, apart from the question of whether
    the respondent in this case was a skilled employee, in my view, the cases
    relied upon by the appellant do not appear to turn solely on the employee’s skill
    set.  Rather, an analysis of those
    decisions suggests that liability depended not as much on whether the employee
    was skilled or unskilled, but rather on whether the employee’s negligence
    amounted to more than carelessness or inattention, both of which come within
    the scope of ordinary negligence, and whether, as required by the analysis, it
    was just and fair to impose a duty of care based on the circumstances of their
    relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The genesis of the distinction between skilled
    and unskilled employees began with <i>Harmer
    v. Cornelius</i> (1858), 5 C.B. (N.S.) 236 (C.P.), which addressed the duty of
    an employee who held himself out to his employer as a skilled scene
    painter.  It quickly became apparent that
    the employee had misrepresented his skill.  The employer was held to be entitled to dismiss the employee for
    incompetence because an employee provides “an implied warranty that he is of
    skill reasonably competent to the task”.  In making a clear distinction between skilled and unskilled employees, Willes
    J. observed in <i>Harmer</i> at p. 246, that
    “[i]t may be that, if there is no general and no particular representation of
    ability and skill, the workman undertakes no responsibility.”  Although there is an obvious difference
    between dismissing an employee for incompetence, such as in <i>Harmer</i>, and the present situation of
    holding an employee liable for negligence, the comments in <i>Harmer </i>are nonetheless important for their distinction between
    skilled and unskilled employees.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the usefulness of this distinction was queried by the House of Lords in <i>Lister v. Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co. Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1957] A.C. 555.  In holding the employee liable to indemnify
    the employer, Viscount Simonds observed at p. 573 that he saw no “valid reason
    for saying that a distinction is to be made between possessing skill and
    exercising it.”  The word “skill”, Viscount
    Simonds observed, “embraces care” and “even in so-called unskilled operations
    an exercise of care is necessary to the proper performance of duty.”  In other words, <i>Lister</i> appears to abrogate any distinction between skilled and
    unskilled employees as a stand-alone criterion for determining liability.  I agree with this aspect of <i>Lister,</i> although, as I will discuss
    later, not with other aspects of that decision.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless, the distinction between skilled and
    unskilled employees was revisited in more recent cases.  One example of such a case is <i>D.H. Overmyer Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Wallace
    Transfer Ltd. </i>(1975), 65 D.L.R. (3d) 717 (B.C.C.A.), which importantly was
    based on contract rather than tort.  In
    that case, the court focused on, and disagreed about, the employee’s exercise
    of skill.  The employee, a general
    manager, had negligently failed to give the notice required to terminate a
    warehouse tenancy.  The majority decided
    in five paragraphs that the employee, who performed managerial duties, failed
    to exercise reasonable care and “skill” and was contractually liable to his
    employer for his negligence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, in a compelling and often-quoted dissent,
    Seaton J.A. determined at p. 722 that employee liability “is restricted to
    those who fail in the skilled work for which they were hired” and, because the
    employee in question was a young and inexperienced employee with no previous
    managerial experience who was virtually unskilled, he should not be liable for
    his negligence.  Thus, Seaton J.A. has
    been read to reinstate a distinction between unskilled and skilled employees.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Seaton J.A.’s reasoning has been adopted in a
    number of cases.  While those cases
    appear to focus on whether the employee was skilled or unskilled, in my view,
    they were essentially decided not on the basis of this categorization, but on
    the degree of employee negligence, or absence of “care”, reflected in the
    particular facts, including the reasonable expectations of the parties in the
    context of the particular employment situation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Dominion
    Manufacturers</i>, referenced by the trial judge in this case, the court held a
    skilled registered industrial accountant liable to his employer, albeit on the
    basis of an implied contractual term that the employee would indemnify the
    employer for his negligence.  However,
    this decision too must be considered in the context of its facts.  Not only did the accountant in that case fail
    to remit sixty employees’ deductions to the government, he also failed to pay outstanding
    public utility bills and municipal taxes.  These were found to be intentional failures to perform the basic
    functions of his employment.  Accordingly,
    to quote the trial judge at p. 222, the employee’s negligence was a “more
    serious omission” that re-occurred over a prolonged period of time.  In my view, the significant aspect of this
    decision is that the employee’s conduct amounted to much more than ordinary
    negligence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    170 (Alta. Q.B.), Fraser J. applied the <i>Overmyer </i>dissent and concluded that a superintendent who represented himself as
    possessing a certain level of “skill”, was liable for breach of an implied contractual
    obligation to use reasonable skill in supervising other employees.  <i>Petrone</i> is relied upon as authority for the proposition that a skilled employee is
    contractually liable.  However, the facts
    of <i>Petrone</i> suggest another basis for liability.
     Mr. Petrone’s breach amounted to much
    more than ordinary negligence; not only did he fail to ensure that the
    labourers under his supervision used the correct form in laying an entire
    section of sidewalk, when the error came to his attention, Petrone did nothing to
    correct it and continued to deny his error.  From a negligence perspective, the conduct involved was tantamount to
    wilful misconduct.</p>

    was also referenced by the trial judge in this case.<i> </i> In <i>Pinto</i>, the conduct of the employee,
    a “skilled” investment advisor, also amounted to more than ordinary negligence.  Indeed, the trial judge found at para. 63 “</span>a

    intelligent and experienced investment advisor, followed by a pattern of
    dishonesty to cover it up that included the provision of fabricated evidence to

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since I
    conclude that employee liability to an employer for ordinary negligence does not
    fit into and is not analogous to any of the existing categories, it is

    implications inform both the first and second stages of the <i>Anns</i> test, it is helpful to situate the

    the duty of care in the employment context in both situations of direct and
    third party liability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In dealing with the direct liability of an
    employee to an employer in <i>Cole v.
    Lockhart </i>(1998), 205 N.B.R. (2d) 48 at para. 14 (Q.B.), McLellan J. observed
    the limitations on employee liability noting that “[t]he courts have recognized
    for many years that an error of an employee will not necessarily permit an
    action for negligence against the employee by the employer.”  In that case, a part-time student employee
    employed on an elk ranch failed to remove all the binder twine from the feed
    and an elk choked on some of the twine.  In
    dismissing the employer’s claim, the trial judge concluded at paras. 22-23 that
    the employer “voluntarily subjected himself to the risks that inevitably
    accompanied” the work and the student’s “very slight error” did not entitle the
    employer to damages for the business risk.  Along similar lines, the court in <i>Dominion Manufacturers </i>observed that
    public policy dictated against litigation between employer and employee and
    noted at p. 222 that, apart from negligence in the vicarious liability
    situation, “[i]n practice, [c]ourts have been reluctant to order the employee
    liable in tort”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    it is seen as settled law by some that an employee who causes damage to a third
    party in the course of his or her employment must be liable to that third
    party, and as an extension of that principle, liable to the employer for the
    same conduct if the employer is held vicariously liable.  Yet there are important differences between holding
    a tortfeasor liable to a third party stranger and holding an employee liable to
    an employer.  The nature of an employment
    relationship raises different policy considerations than other circumstances
    involving negligent conduct.  The
    renowned tort scholar John G. Fleming suggests, in <i>The Law of Torts, </i>9th ed. (Sydney: LBC Information Services, 1998),
    that an employee should be held personally liable for negligence only in
    limited circumstances and, further, that policy reasons support the view that
    courts should generally be reluctant to allow third parties to pursue
    negligence actions even directly against employees.  He observes at p. 411 that those policy
    reasons relate to resource allocation and suggests an abolishment of the
    ability of insurers of third-party claimants to subrogate against employees.  He notes that this result has been achieved
    in other jurisdictions either by practice or by legislation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The master’s vicarious liability does not displace
    the servant’s personal liability to the tort victim.  But this conclusion is neither self-evident
    nor beyond all objection.  For one thing,
    ordinarily it is positively desirable that the master absorb the cost as a
    matter of sound resource allocation rather than that he be considered merely as
    guaranteeing the servant’s primary responsibility to pay for the damage.  For another, to hold the servant liable will
    either tend to overtax his financial resources (especially under modern
    conditions when these have become increasingly unequal to his capacity for
    causing great loss) or require double insurance, covering both him and his
    employer against the same risk.  For
    these reasons, there is now a growing momentum in many countries for
    “channelling” liability to the employer alone; the employee being freed
    altogether from claims by third parties and liable at most to his employer for
    a limited contribution when this is justified on disciplinary grounds.  This mostly corresponds also with <i>practices </i>elsewhere; employees are
    joined as defendants usually only pro forma or to enlarge the scope of
    discovery.  Moreover, in
    <st1:country-region

    subrogation against employees under

    policy reasons were not addressed by the majority in <i>London Drugs </i>when exculpating negligent employees from liability
    for their third party damage.  Instead,
    the majority concluded in that case that the employees were entitled to the
    benefit of a contractual limitation of liability clause contained in the
    contract between the employer and the third party.  However, the majority also commented on the
    claim framed in tort, saying at pp. 407-408 that there is no general rule in
    Canada that an employee performing the “very essence” of the employer’s
    contractual obligations does not owe a duty of care to the employer’s
    customers.  In making this observation,
    the majority accepted the unchallenged finding of foreseeability made by the
    trial court and did not undertake a separate proximity analysis of the type

    the minority decision of LaForest J. undertook a complete proximity analysis
    that included an instructive review of the policy considerations that arise
    from an employment relationship.  This
    analysis required an examination of the House of Lords decision in <i>Lister</i>, discussed earlier in these
    reasons.  The facts in <i>Lister</i> involved a truck driver employee
    who injured a third person through his negligence, for which the truck driver’s
    employer was held vicariously liable.  The employer’s insurer subrogated its claim and sued the employee.  <i>Lister</i> concluded that all employees are liable to their employers for even the
    simplest act of ordinary negligence.  This conclusion was received with strong criticism.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    the reaction against <i>Lister </i>was so
    strong that the British government intervened.  It struck an Inter-Departmental Committee to address <i>Lister’s </i>ramifications for industrial
    relations.  Those ramifications are
    discussed by P.S. Atiyah in <i>Vicarious
    Liability in the Law of Torts </i>(London: Butterworths, 1967) at p. 426.  While Atiyah discusses the issue in regard to
    vicarious liability, his comments apply with even greater force to the issue of
    direct employee liability:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is obvious that the whole foundation of vicarious
    liability as it operates today would be seriously affected if employers made a
    regular practice of suing their servants for indemnities when they had been
    rendered vicariously liable.  As was said
    by a Committee set up to enquire into the implications of the <i>Lister </i>case:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>There can … be no doubt that if there were any
    real possibility of employees regularly being called upon to pay out of their
    own pockets damages resulting from acts of carelessness or inattention
    occurring in the course of their employment, a situation would be created for
    which some remedy would have to be provided.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Committee resolved the controversy without the need for a legislative response
    by recommending insurers enter into “gentleman’s agreements” that they would
    not enforce their rights of subrogation against employees, except in
    cases of collusion or wilful misconduct.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    on the level of the employee’s skill, but on the degree of the employee’s
    negligence.  The agreements, which have
    largely endured, are also apparently honoured by Canadian insurers, since there
    have been few cases of employer claims against employees for negligence.</p>

    and observed at p. 333, that “in general employees are not realistically
    in a position” to contract with their employer, or their employer’s customer,
    regarding their potential tort liability for foreseeable property damage.  Furthermore, he noted at p. 341 that
    indemnification of an employer by an employee in the vicarious liability
    context is contrary to the very “policy foundation of vicarious liability”
    (employer liability) and further at p. 356 that “there is no logical necessity
    that the employer’s liability in tort depend on the personal liability of the
    servant.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, in his view, employees generally
    should not be liable in tort to indemnify an employer for damages payable to a
    third party injured by their negligence, except where the employee is “grossly
    negligent”.  In arriving at this
    conclusion, LaForest J. referenced the approach established in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    , which
    limits the circumstances in which an employee can be held liable for torts to
    circumstances involving either intentional or grossly negligent conduct.  He also referred to the policy reasons in
    support of this approach, which are set out by B.S. Markesinis in <i>A Comparative Introduction to the German Law
    of Torts, </i>2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990) at pp. 574-75:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus, damage done by an employee without intention
    or gross negligence while engaged on a dangerous job is one of the employer’s
    business risks and must be borne by him alone.  To allot damage done by the employee to the
    risks of the business, in the absence of gross negligence, is justified by the
    fact that it is the division of labour within the business which exposes the
    employee to the risks specific to his work.  Division of labour and organizational
    structure are matters for the employer whose ownership and power of management
    enable him to determine how the work of the business is to be organized.  The employee, on the other hand, given his
    subordinate position, has little or no influence on these factors which are
    relevant to the damage caused.  Since the
    employer is better able to deploy technical and organizational measures to
    reduce the special risks of the business and to take out any necessary
    insurance, it is right to treat damage as a risk of the business to be borne by
    him alone unless it is due to the intentional or grossly negligent conduct of
    the employee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, La Forest J. would restrict the
    circumstances in which an employee is liable in tort to situations of
    intentional wrongdoing or gross negligence.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  Bearing in mind these discussions about policy
    issues surrounding employee liability, I turn to the necessary <i>Anns</i> analysis.</p>
  <h2><i>(a)       Stage one – reasonable foreseeability and
    sufficient proximity</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this
    case, the component of reasonable foreseeability under the first stage of the <i>Anns</i> test is readily established based on
    the trial judge’s unchallenged finding that the respondent knew about the
    dangers of an open flame near gasoline.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn
    to discuss the second component of sufficient proximity.  I do so mindful of McLachlin C.J.’s
    description at para. 25 of <i>Childs</i> that
    proximity is “two-sided” and requires not only foreseeability of the
    plaintiff’s loss, but also an explanation of “why it is just and fair to impose
    the cost of that loss on the particular defendant before the court”.  I am also mindful of the guidance provided in <i>Syl Apps</i> at para. 30 that “the
    factors to be considered in the proximity analysis include the parties’
    expectations, representations and reliance”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>Accordingly, the question of sufficient
    proximity asks whether the relationship between the parties was of such a nature
    that it would be just and fair to impose the employer’s loss on the employee
    based on the parties’ expectations, representations and reliance.  As I have already discussed, this analysis does
    not focus only on whether the respondent was skilled or unskilled, but instead
    looks at the overall parameters of the relationship. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, it
    is preferable to consider the parties’ relationship by focussing on the
    expectations they had of each other and to situate the negligence under
    consideration within the parameters of those expectations.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An examination
    of the employment relationship demonstrates that employee negligence was
    foreseeable and that the employee’s liability for ordinary negligence was not.  This is apparent from the expectations that can
    be readily inferred from any common sense consideration of the employment
    relationship.  Both an employer and an
    employee would normally expect the other to exercise reasonable care: the
    employer would expect the employee to perform his tasks with reasonable care,
    and the employee would expect the employer to take reasonable care for his or
    her safety.  In addition, both would know
    that accidents happen, whether as a result of defective equipment provided by
    the employer, as a result of the employee’s carelessness in the use of that equipment,
    or for some other reason. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fact
    that employee negligence was contemplated in this case is supported by the
    terms the appellant specified in the respondent's employment.  When the appellant hired the respondent
    as a “boat boy”, he knew that the respondent’s negligence could cause harm and,
    accordingly, imposed rules to protect his safety.  As in most other employment relationships, the
    appellant was also aware that it was unlikely the respondent would have the
    financial resources to compensate for any loss, such as the $285,000 loss that
    actually occurred.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  An expectation that the respondent would be
    able to compensate for loss, through insurance or otherwise, was not
    articulated at the time of his employment and, in any event, would be
    unreasonable given the respondent’s young age and his wage of $8.00 an
    hour.  The appellant also knew that he
    had insurance to guard against many losses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this
    view of the parties’ expectations, representations and reliance, it would be neither
    just nor fair to impose the loss on the respondent.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  While this is enough to conclude that
    the appellant has failed to establish a duty of care, in my view, the policy
    considerations discussed above pertaining to employment relationships as well
    as to other societal issues also negate liability, as I will discuss further under
    the second stage of the <i>Anns </i>analysis.<i> </i> </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To summarize, in the circumstances of this case,
    the component of reasonable foreseeability under the first stage of the <i>Anns </i>test is satisfied.  However, having regard to the nature of the
    parties’ relationship, the component of sufficient proximity is not.  Accordingly,
    I conclude that a duty of care should not be imposed for the respondent's
    ordinary negligence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>I turn to the second stage of the <i>Anns </i>test, which in my opinion also
    negates the imposition a duty of care on an employee who commits an act of
    ordinary negligence.</p>
  <h3><span> </span>(b)      Stage
    two – residual policy factors</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I begin
    this discussion bearing in mind that the considerations at this second stage of
    the analysis are concerned not with the particular relationship, “but
    with the effect of recognizing a duty of care on other legal obligations, the
    legal system and society more generally” (<i>Cooper </i>at para. 37).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A return
    to the <i>Lister </i>principle of employee
    liability without regard to the individual circumstances of each case would
    create the potential for significant disruption to employer/employee relations.  Obviously, certain types of employment are
    disproportionately fraught with risk.  For
    example, in these days of increasingly complex technology, employees are
    required to handle ever more sophisticated machinery.  Minor employee error can result in major equipment
    breakdown and, consequently significant damages.  In those circumstances, employment relations
    would be greatly challenged if an employee was to be held financially liable to
    the employer for the financial consequences of a momentary lapse of attention.  As LaForest J. observed at p. 340 of <i>London Drugs</i>, “an employee’s capacity to
    cause loss does not bear any relation to his salary.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, there is a power imbalance inherent in most employment relationships.  An employee is usually not in a position to
    bargain at the outset of the employment relationship regarding the terms of his
    or her potential liability for an act of negligence.  In contrast, an employer concerned about
    employee negligence is in a position to dictate terms of employment and can
    contract for the employee’s liability.  As LaForest J. points out at p. 34 of <i>London Drugs</i>, employers are
    at liberty to establish “contractual schemes of contribution from negligent
    employees” and such contractual terms would be relevant to a tort claim.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, while employees are implicitly, if not explicitly, expected to
    exercise reasonable care in their employment, there are other means to
    encourage that care without burdening the employee with an impossible financial
    judgment.  While the appellant argued
    that a finding of liability against the respondent will promote responsibility
    in all workers, I am not persuaded that is so.  Discipline and dismissal are often cited as more useful tools to promote
    deterrence without the need to impose financial responsibility.  Thus, a policy that supports good industrial
    relations weighs against the imposition of a duty of care.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, risk
    and resource allocation are important policy considerations.  These considerations, which are particularly
    relevant to employment situations, support the conclusion that the employer
    should be the party charged with protecting his or her own interests.  This is because the employer is generally in
    a better position than the employee to internalize the cost of ordinary employee
    negligence, whether as a cost of doing business or by acquiring appropriate
    insurance.  Generally speaking, employers
    do so.  This was the view taken in <i>Morris v. Ford Motor Co. Ltd., </i>[1973] 1
    Q.B. 792 (C.A.), where Lord Denning emphasized that the employer should bear
    the liability for employee negligence because the employer enjoys the benefit
    of the work and should, in turn, bear the burden.  He supports this view by pointing to the fact
    that the employee’s wages are fixed on the basis that the employer will bear
    the expense of employee negligence, usually through insurance.  If the employer chooses not to obtain
    insurance, he or she should still absorb the cost of avoiding harm as a matter
    of sound resource allocation.  If it was
    otherwise, and the employee is expected to bear the risk, his or her wages
    should be increased to cover that risk.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In concluding that liability must depend on the
    individual contractual circumstances of the employment, Seaton J.A. in <i>Overmyer </i>observed at pp. 723-24 that an
    employer accepts the risk of employee fallibility and takes that fallibility
    into account in the costs of doing business, supervising the employee, and
    insuring the enterprise.  Regarding any
    presumption of employee liability, he stated at pp. 724-25:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If an employee, by lack of care, causes loss to his
    employer, I do not think that it should be presumed that the employee will be
    liable, and I do not think that we should look at decisions on other employment
    contracts for the answer. We should look at the hiring to see what was said and
    at the circumstances to see what might properly be implied. <u>It follows that
    this employment and this error must be looked at to see what terms were in the
    contract and whether they were breached</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, it would make no economic sense to
    require both the employer and the employee to obtain and maintain insurance
    coverage.  An approach that promotes
    double insurance – even assuming such insurance would be available to every
    employee – has no social utility: see <i>London
    Drugs</i> at p. 387.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as I have already noted, a determination that, in the ordinary course,
    employees are not liable to indemnify employers for ordinary negligence,
    accords with practice or legislation in many other jurisdictions that have already
    abolished the right of insurers to subrogate against employees under general
    liability policies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in addition to my conclusion at the first stage of the <i>Anns</i> test that the parties’ relationship lacks the necessary
    proximity, I would also conclude that the residual policy considerations at the
    second stage of the <i>Anns</i> analysis
    weigh against the imposition of a duty of care.  In coming to this conclusion, I observe that
    the result could be different if the loss is occasioned by negligence outside
    the parties’ reasonable expectations, such as one caused by an intentional tort
    or wilful misconduct on the respondent’s part.  <i>London Drugs </i>also references
    “gross negligence”, a concept I would leave for discussion in another case
    where it is raised by the particular facts.  Finally, the result may be different in other situations, such as if the
    negligence involved a vehicular accident, where different considerations may
    apply between insurers and, as well, if the defendant had been from a
    profession where, as the <i>Lister </i>Committee
    said, “it is accepted prudence” to purchase insurance (<i>Gardiner</i> at 655).</p>
  <h2>Claim in contract</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the primary thrust of the appellant’s action was based on negligence, the respondent
    points out that the contract of employment cannot be enforced against the
    respondent because it did not satisfy the common law requirement that the
    contract as a whole be “for the benefit” of the minor: see Geoffrey England et
    al., <i>Employment Law in Canada</i>, 4th
    ed., looseleaf (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Markham:
    Butterworths, 2005) at 4.7.  Liability in
    contract was not pressed by the appellant on appeal.  In any event, in my view, the employment
    contract in this case cannot be said “as a whole” to be a contract for the
    respondent’s benefit.  Accordingly, I
    would reject the appellant’s claim against the respondent in contract. </p>
  <h2>DISPOSITION</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the
    appeal.  The agreed-upon costs of

    the respondent. </p>
