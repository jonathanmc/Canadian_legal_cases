    appellant appeals from the judgment of Langdon J. dated August 2, 2006 ordering
    that the respondent mother have custody of the five children of the marriage.
    In addition, the trial judge ordered that payment of the equalization payment
    by the respondent to the appellant be delayed until July 1, 2010. In a costs
    ruling dated November 15, 2006, the trial judge ordered that the appellant pay
    to the respondent costs of the trial on a substantial indemnity basis in the
    amount of $203,032.50. The appellant appeals from each of these aspects of the
    trial judge’s orders.</p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><b><span

    the trial judge’s order, the children had been living with their father in the
    matrimonial home under a temporary order made on December 14, 2004 that the
    father be the primary caregiver for the children. The appellant claims that, in
    effectively reversing the temporary order, the trial judge made the following
    errors:</p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>he failed to
    consider the stability the children experienced while in their father’s care
    and the fact that the children were doing well;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>he failed to
    consider the impact of changing the custodial regime and severely limiting the
    contact between the children and their father;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>he focused unduly on the reasons for the <i>status quo</i> rather than the <i>status quo</i> itself;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>he failed to
    consider the stated wishes of the children;</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>he failed to give
    due consideration to the reasons of the assessor; and</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>he gave undue
    weight to his finding that the appellant is a “schemer”. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>In essence, the
    appellant contends that because of the foregoing errors the trial judge failed
    to properly consider the best interests of the children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do
    not accept the appellant’s submissions. While it may be that the trial judge’s
    characterization of the father as a schemer was somewhat overstated and
    unnecessary, read as a whole, in our view, the trial judge’s reasons reflect a
    focus on the children’s best interests and the conclusion that those interests
    would best be served by placing them in their mother’s custody for several
    reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    under the father’s proposal the children would be in the care of a nanny for
    twelve hours per day on weekdays whereas that would not be the case under the
    mother’s proposal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge was satisfied that the father had tried to undermine the mother’s
    role in the children’s lives during the period the temporary order was in place
    and he was not satisfied that the mother would engage in similar conduct in the
    future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    although he was conscious of the difficulties the mother had experienced in the
    period immediately prior to, and for a period following, the separation, the
    trial judge was satisfied the mother had demonstrated superlative qualities as
    a mother previously and that her difficulties had been largely resolved.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, having
    regard to the counselling and treatment the oldest child had received during
    the temporary order the trial judge believed that the child’s issues with the mother
    were capable of resolution. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    the trial judge was satisfied that certain key aspects of the assessor’s report
    had been undermined by the evidence at trial. In particular, medical evidence
    at trial demonstrated that the mother did not have a mood disorder.  Moreover, the trial judge was satisfied that
    the mother’s rage at the father was matched by the father’s rage at the mother
    and that the mother’s anger had abated. Finally, the trial judge was satisfied
    that the wishes of the younger children had been influenced by the older
    children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent
    an error in law or a material error in appreciation of the facts, the decision
    of a trial judge in matters of custody and access is entitled to great
    deference on appeal. On this issue, the trial judge gave detailed reasons
    following a nineteen-day trial. In our view, his essential findings were
    available on the evidence as was his conclusion that the children’s best
    interests would be served by placing them in the care of their mother.
    Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><b><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b>The appeal from the order delaying payment of
    the equalization payment</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We see
    no merit in this ground of appeal.  The
    payment was set off against the costs order. In these circumstances, the timing
    of the payment is essentially irrelevant.</p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><b><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b>The appeal from the costs order</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As with
    a custody order, a trial judge’s decision on costs attracts significant
    deference. In this case, it is apparent that the trial judge was well aware of
    all of the factors impacting on the costs award. In our view, the appellant has
    not identified any error that would justify interfering with the trial judge’s
    decision.</p>

    appeal is therefore dismissed. Costs to the respondent including the costs
    relating to the two earlier motions fixed at $14,500.00 inclusive of GST and
    disbursements.  The costs order will be
    secured against the appellant’s interest in the matrimonial home.</p>
