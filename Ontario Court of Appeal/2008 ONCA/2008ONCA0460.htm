style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent Temple Kol Ami (TKA) owned two abutting parcels of land in the
    City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan (please see Diagram 1).  On October 27, 2003, it entered into an
    agreement of purchase and sale to sell the southerly parcel to BAF Management
    Ltd. (BAF).  By way of that agreement and its later amendments, TKA was to
    reserve an easement over the southerly parcel. This easement was to run north/south
    and its purpose was to give the northerly parcel access to
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Summeridge Drive – the road which extends along the south limit of the southerly
    parcel.  The northerly parcel required road access to Summeridge Drive because
    its only other road access – to Dufferin Street – was right in-right out
    only.  This reserved easement is referenced as the “Part 7 Easement”.  </p>

    July 2004, unknown to TKA, BAF agreed to sell the southerly parcel to the
    appellant, Elm Thornhill Woods Inc. (Elm).  TKA knew nothing of BAF’s agreements
    with Elm until just before its own sale to BAF was scheduled to close in
    March 2006.</p>

    is no issue that at the time of its sale to BAF, TKA intended to build a
    synagogue on the northerly parcel. That intention is referenced in many documents
    including the agreement of purchase and sale between TKA and BAF, site plan
    applications to the City, planning decisions and zoning by-laws issued by
    the City, as well as a letter of intent between TKA and Elm Developments
    Corp. (a company related to Elm) in relation to the proposed construction
    of a synagogue.</p>

    noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

    the agreement of purchase and sale had been entered into between TKA and
    BAF, and after the consent application to the Committee of Adjustment for
    approval of the sale was made, it was discovered that TKA did not own a small
    portion of land located between the southern boundary of the southerly parcel
    and the northern boundary of Summeridge Road.  This small portion of land
    is referenced as “Block 392”.  Unless TKA was able to obtain an easement
    over Block 392 – in addition to its existing Part 7 Easement – cars would
    be unable to travel from the southerly parcel onto

    the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan required a new application for approval to be submitted in respect
    of this parcel.  To avoid an anticipated delay waiting for the City’s approval,
    TKA and BAF agreed to close the sale transaction and thereafter jointly pursue
    the City’s approval for the transfer and required easement over Block 392.  BAF
    directed TKA to endorse the transfer it was to receive on the sale directly
    to its own purchaser, Elm, thereby by-passing a registration to BAF. Elm
    executed an undertaking to TKA promising to obtain the Committee of Adjustment’s
    permission for and then registration of the Block 392 access easement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    the undersigned hereby undertakes to execute a transfer of easement over
    Part of Block 392, Plan 65M-3757 being Part 13, 65R-28438 as soon as Temple
    Kol Ami obtains the consent of the Committee of Adjustment of the City of
    Vaughan to this transfer of easement and will further execute any further
    applications necessary for submission to the City of Vaughan for consenting
    to this transfer of easement and also appoints Temple Kol Ami as our agent
    for obtaining the consent of the Committee of Adjustments to this transfer
    of easement. All costs relating to the Committee of Adjustments’ application
    are to be at the sole cost and expense of the

    March 24, 2006, title to both Block 392 and the southerly parcel (with the
    Part 7 Easement reserved on title) were electronically transferred to Elm.  Thereafter
    Elm proceeded with its plans for the site and developed the lands into freehold
    condominium townhouses which included the construction of the access easement.  All
    of Elm’s buyers agreed to the existence of the access easement and took title
    subject to it and without any form of condition in their agreements of purchase
    and sale with Elm.</p>

    to execute a transfer of easement over Block 392 or to in any way assist
    TKA in its efforts to obtain the necessary consent of the City of Vaughan.  Elm
    now claims that the undertaking was given to TKA and BAF pursuant to its
    agreement with BAF for the purchase of the property and on the understanding
    and agreement that it was for the sole purpose and condition of accessing,
    using, and enjoying a synagogue to be built on the adjacent TKA lands.</p>

      is important to recall that both the northerly and southerly parcels were
      originally owned by TKA.  When TKA sold the southerly parcel it did so
      in such a way that it retained for itself an easement over the southerly
      parcel (which became known as the Part 7 Easement).  This easement was
      never conveyed away to BAF, Elm, or anyone else.  TKA retained the right
      to itself in perpetuity.  Elm’s deed to the southerly parcel shows the
      easement reserved as follows: “ … reserving to the transferor [TKA] an
      easement in perpetuity over part of lot 12, Concession 2, City of
    <st1:place

      could not “grant” those property rights back to TKA. </span></p>

      my view, however, <i>Dumbrell </i>is distinguishable.  <i>Dumbrell</i> was
      a case about the interpretation of an employment contract.  Mr. Dumbrell
      was a real estate expert who was employed by Regional to investigate and
      bring profitable large-scale development projects to Regional.  During
      his short tenure with Regional<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

      effort and much of his time into a commercial property known as the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Queen Street property.  He had amassed considerable information about the
    property – some of which was of a confidential nature.  Gordon, the principle
    of Regional, used Dumbrell’s information in discussions he had with certain
    developers, and this ultimately resulted in the sale of the property in January
    2000.  Gordon held a 25% interest in the syndicate which held the property.  When
    Gordon’s syndicate interest was sold in May 2002, Gordon profited by a little
    over one million dollars.  Dumbrell claimed to be entitled to an interest
    in that profit realized more than two years after his contract with Regional
    had ended. Regional took the position that Dumbrell’s potential remuneration
    was limited to projects that were completed and closed at the time his employment
    contract was terminated.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[T]he question of whether Dumbrell was entitled to commission on the

      addressing this question this court thoroughly  reviewed the law in relation
      to contractual interpretation beginning with <i>Consolidated–Bathurst Export
      Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
      888, as later refined and explained in <i>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Novopharm
      Ltd.</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, and drew a number of conclusions.  Doherty
      J.A. observed at paras. 51-53:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[51]     <i>Eli Lilly, supra</i>, instructs that the words of the
      contract drawn between the parties must be the focal point of the interpretative
      exercise.  The inquiry must be into the meaning of the words and not the
      subjective intentions of the parties.  In this sense my approach is textualist.
      However, the meaning of the written agreement must be distinguished from
      the dictionary and syntactical meaning of the words used in the agreement.
      Lord Hoffman observed in <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at p. 115 All E.R.:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey
      to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words.  The
      meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning
      of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant
      background would reasonably have been understood to mean.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]     No doubt, the dictionary and grammatical meaning of the words
      (sometimes called the “plain meaning”) used by the parties will be important
      and often decisive in determining the meaning of the document.  However,
      the former cannot be equated with the latter. The meaning of a document
      is derived not just from the words used, but from the context or the circumstances
      in which the words were used.  Professor John Swan puts it well in <i>Canadian
      Contract Law </i>(Markham, Ont.: </span></p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>There are a number of inherent features of language that need to be
      noted.  Few, if any, words can be understood apart from their context and
      no contractual language can be understood without some knowledge of its
      context and the purpose of the contract.  Words, taken individually, have
      an inherent vagueness that will often require courts to determine their
      meaning by looking at their context and the expectations that the parties
      may have had.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[53]     The text of the written agreement must be read as a whole
      and in the context of the circumstances as they existed when the agreement
      was created.  The circumstances include facts that were known or reasonably
      capable of being known by the parties when they entered into the written
      agreement.</span></p>

      essence the appellant argues that the <i>Dumbrell </i>approach requires
      that the context and circumstances existing at the time of the undertaking
      was given included the understanding on the part of all parties that TKA
      would in the future build a synagogue on the northerly parcel.  It was
      in this context that Elm gave the undertaking it did, and accordingly the
      undertaking must be interpreted as being conditional on TKA using the property
      for a synagogue and for no other purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, this argument cannot succeed.  The contract in <i>Dumbrell </i>did
      not specifically contemplate the situation which arose in that case and
      the court was required to interpret the contract by looking to the language
      used by the parties as well as the context and circumstances which existed
      at the time.  While the contract provided that Dumbrell was to be paid
      a percentage of “profits” the court was required to consider the meaning
      of that term in light of the language used in the entire document as well
      as the nature of the business in which the parties were engaged and the
      terms of the agreement.  The court concluded there was nothing in the language
      of the document that limited Dumbrell’s potential remuneration to projects
      completed and closed as of the date of termination of his employment contract.  Importantly
      at para. 65 the court stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Reasonable people in the position of Dumbrell and Gordon would have
      appreciated that Regional’s involvement in the kind of complex large scale
      commercial projects that it was anticipated Dumbrell would bring to it
      may well not be completed within the relatively short time span contemplated
      by the employment contract.</span></p>

      contrast, the undertaking given by Elm to BAF and TKA is a very brief and
      simple document (as set out in full in para. 12 above).  There is no question
      that in the spring of 2006 when the transactions were taking place, the
      parties believed that TKA would – at some future date – build a synagogue
      on the northerly parcel.  However, by summer of that same year TKA had
      changed its mind and instead determined to use the property for residential
      development. The question for this court, as I see it, is whether the undertaking
      given by the appellant can be interpreted as having been given on the condition
      that only a synagogue would be built on the northerly parcel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      my view the answer to that question must clearly be
    “no”.  There is nothing in the language used in that document which could  be
    considered to convey a meaning that the undertaking was in anyway conditional.  There
    is no language of restriction.  It was no secret at the time the undertaking
    was given that TKA’s intention to build a synagogue was just that: an intention
    only.  No contract had been signed, no ground broken.  BAF and Elm were sophisticated
    commercial business persons represented by skilled and experienced solicitors.</span></p>

      is also nothing in the agreement of purchase and sale between BAF and Elm

      of the synagogue lands.  This clause shall not merge on the closing of

      sold its interest in the property to TKA until only a few days before its
      sale to BAF was to be completed.  During the course of the sale from BAF
      to Elm, there were no direct dealings between Elm and TKA.</span></p>

      sale that could be construed as an agreement, undertaking, or condition
      on the part of TKA to build  a synagogue, to the exclusion of all else,
      on the subject property.  At most the clauses acknowledge the future intention
      of TKA to build a synagogue on the site but there is nothing in the language
      that <i>requires</i> it to do so.  Further, there is nothing in the record
      that demonstrates that TKA bound itself to construct a synagogue on the
      lands to the exclusion of all else.  Therefore, neither the agreement of
      purchase and sale nor the undertaking contained any language which could
      on any reasonable interpretation be read as a condition which <i>required </i>TKA<i> </i>to

      to do something and binding oneself to do that very something. Elm is a
      sophisticated corporate developer who was represented by competent, experienced
      counsel throughout; if it considered TKA to be legally bound to construct
      a synagogue, it ought to have required this condition to be reduced to
      writing and included in the documentation. Failure to do so suggests that
      there is not and never was any such condition.</span></p>

      for the context and circumstances at the time, there is substantial parol
      evidence to indicate there never was an intention to include a condition
      in the undertaking or agreement.  It will be recalled that Elm did not
      negotiate with TKA, but with BAF.  TKA was not aware, until a few days
      before the closing of its sale to BAF, that BAF had agreed to sell its
      interest to Elm.  In the circumstances, the extent to which TKA could have
      led Elm to believe it was binding itself to build a synagogue is unclear.</span></p>

      BAF, who did have direct negotiations with TKA, was never under the impression

      solicitor Bernard Feintuch states that Elm never requested orally or in
      writing that the easement be conditional on the northerly property being
      developed as a synagogue.  Further, he states that it was he who prepared
      the agreement of purchase and sale between BAF and Elm.  He explains that

lang=EN-US>The use of a right-of-way must be within the terms of the grant or
      of accustomed use (in the case of a right acquired by implied grant, implied
      reservation or prescription), and it must be reasonable.  <i>As a general
      rule, the use of a right-of-way depends on the nature of the servient land
      and the purposes for which the right-of-way is intended to be used.</i>  If
      the grant of a right-of-way is not limited to any particular purpose, or
      if a way has been used for several purposes, a general right-of-way may
      be inferred.  However, this will not be the case where the evidence shows
      intended use for particular purposes only.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

      easement is the purpose for which the grant was initially made.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

lang=EN-US>            Can the initial grant be read to contemplate the possibility
      of a change in the nature of the use of the easement, or are the rights
      frozen at the time of the grant?  Naturally, the grantee is not entitled
      to increase the burden on the servient lands beyond rights initially conveyed,
      but it may have been contemplated or taken as implied that the easement’s
      use would change over time.  If so, an apparent increase in the burden
      can be a valid use of the initial right.  For example, in <i>Laurie v.
      Winch </i>[[1953] 1 S.C.R. 49]<i>,<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></i>farmland
      (the dominant tenement) was subdivided into residential lots.  The easement,
      which was granted as a perpetual right of way over a slender lot near the
      farm, was split into a larger number of easements, one of these being attached
      to each new lot.  The Supreme Court of Canada treated this diffusion as
      valid.  There was nothing to suggest that it was contemplated that the
      lands would always be used for agricultural purposes, or that changes in
      the use of the dominant lands would affect the continued existence of the
      easement. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>

    by using additional express language to that effect– assuming TKA was in
    agreement to such further restrictions. That such express synagogue-specific

      second issue to be addressed is whether the land’s change of use will affect
      the burden on the servient tenement; essentially, whether the contemplated
      residential townhouses put a greater burden on the servient tenement than
      a contemplated synagogue.  I say “contemplated” because there is no actual
      usage with which to compare the usage that will result from the change.  As
      there never was a synagogue, any comparison in usage must be entirely speculative.  At
      the same time it must be noted that the synagogue use contemplated was
      more than simply a synagogue – the plans included the construction of a
      social hall and a school as well.  Elm has failed to produce any evidence
      to demonstrate that the burden on the servient tenement will be substantially
