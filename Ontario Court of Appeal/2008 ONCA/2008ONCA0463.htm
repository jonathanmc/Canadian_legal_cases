    is an appeal from the judgment of Somers J. wherein he awarded the respondent
    damages in the sum of $1,065,571.40 together with prejudgment interest from
    December 31, 2001 to the date of judgment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>      </span>The
    appellants are in the business of complex film financing and the respondent
    is a small Canadian movie studio.  In April 2001, the appellants and the
    respondent agreed to complete certain transactions involving two movies called “Say
    Nothing” and “Phase 4”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>     </span>When
    the federal government changed its incentive scheme, the appellants ran into
    difficulty with their financing.  They did not pay the respondent and took
    the position that the contract was conditional only and that the conditions
    had not been fulfilled.  The respondent disagreed and sued for the full amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>     </span>The
    trial judge found for the respondent on the basis that there simply was no
    such condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>    </span>The
    appellants appeal his decision to this court arguing that the trial judge
    did not give sufficient reasons and did not hear oral argument before releasing
    his decision.  The appellants also move to submit fresh evidence showing
    that the trial judge was unable to follow much of the trial evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>      </span>At
    the heart of this contractual dispute is a program of tax incentives instituted
    by the Canadian federal government to those engaged in the film industry
    in Canada and those who invest in that business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>      </span>The
    corporate appellants are in the business of organizing, promoting, and managing
    very complicated film financing arrangements or syndications.  In the spring
    of 2001, the respondent became aware that some of the federal government’s
    tax incentives could apply to its work and it consulted with the appellants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>      </span>The
    film financing arrangement proposed by the appellants was as follows.  Funds
    for the syndicates were raised from private investors, who bought units from
    the appellants in a “Master Limited Partnership” (MLP).  The chief attraction
    from an investor’s point of view was that almost the entire cost of the investment
    could be written off against current income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>      </span>The
    MLP would own units in a number of “Production Limited Partnerships” (PLPs).  Each
    PLP was assigned to a specific film and would be responsible for incurring
    all of the film’s expenses that fell into the category of “Non-Canadian Labour
    Expenditure” (NCLE).  NCLE, in general terms, encompasses all expenses that
    do not relate to hiring Canadian labour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the syndication to function, the appellants needed to have films willing
    to participate.  Participating studios were paid a fee which was calculated
    as an agreed upon percentage of the total NCLE incurred on the movie. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 9, 2001, the appellants and the respondent signed an agreement in the
    form of a letter.  This agreement contemplated film financing transactions
    for two movies wherein the respondent would receive a fee of 6% of the NCLE
    on each movie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the fall of 2001 the federal government announced changes to the tax incentive
    scheme and as a consequence the appellants had difficulty selling partnership
    units to investors. They could not raise enough money to close all the transactions
    they had hoped to on the basis of the 6% fee.  They contacted the respondent
    and proposed reducing the fee to 3.5%.  The respondent refused and commenced
    these proceedings for the full 6% it contracted to receive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants took the position that it was a condition of their
    agreement with the respondent that if the appellants were unable to raise
    sufficient money from the sale of partnership units to cover the 6% fee owing
    to the respondent, the respondent would bear that loss.  The respondent argued
    there was no such condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the contract did not contain this condition and granted
    judgment in favour of the respondent.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants in their factum raise three grounds of appeal.  Those three grounds
    are:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span>1.         The
    insufficiency of the trial judge’s reasons for judgment;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span>            </span>2.         The failure by the trial judge to
    hear oral argument before releasing his reasons for judgment; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span>3.         The
    inability of the trial judge to follow much of the evidence led at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ third ground of appeal is based on fresh evidence which is the
    subject of a motion before this court.  In oral argument, counsel for the
    appellants conceded that this third
    “ground” is not really a separate, stand alone ground of appeal but rather
    is a factor that provides context for the other two grounds.</p>
  <h3><span>      </span>1.   Sufficiency of Reasons</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    trial judge is required to give reasons for his or her decision.  As this
    court noted in <i>Lawson v. Lawson</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 321 at para.
    9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>            </span>It is the duty of a judge
    to give reasons for decision; it is an inherent aspect of the discharge of
    a judge’s responsibilities.…  The appellant is entitled to reasons that are
    sufficient to enable him to know why issues were decided against him.  The
    reasons need to be adequate also so that he can bring a meaningful appeal
    and this court is able to properly review the Order.  The reasons do not
    need to be perfect.  Nor do they necessarily need to be lengthy.  But, they
    must be sufficient to enable the parties, the general public and this court,
    sitting in review, to know whether the applicable legal principles and evidence
    were properly considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellants complain that the trial judge’s reasons do not
    contain the necessary findings of fact, nor do they address the issues and
    defences raised by the appellants.  Specifically, the appellants argue that
    the trial judge did not address the following two arguments they made at
    trial:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span>            </span>1.         The April 9, 2001 letter agreement
    was not a binding contract for the payment of money but was merely an agreement
    to complete certain other transactions.  Further, the 6% fee would only be
    payable if and when the transactions closed and the obligation to complete
    the transactions was conditional and dependent on: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span>            (i)        The
    sale of sufficient units of the MLP to the public; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(ii)       The respondent completing certain preliminary steps, including
    setting up corporations, handling those corporations’ finances in a particular
    way, and providing related information to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In the alternative, even
    if the contract did impose an unconditional obligation to pay the 6% fee,
    the respondent knew that the appellants did not intend to undertake such
    an obligation, and the law will not permit one party to enforce a contractual
    term that it knows the other party had not agreed to.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>2.         In the further alternative, the respondent failed to mitigate
    its losses when it rejected the appellants’ offer to pay a reduced commission
    of 3.5% with the respondent reserving all its right to sue for the balance
    of 2.5%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge adequately dealt with these issues in his reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span><b>(i)        <i>The
        letter agreement was a binding contract for the payment of money and
        was not conditional on the sale of sufficient partnership units</i> </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge clearly held that the letter agreement was a
    binding contract for the payment of money and that it was not conditional
    on the sale of sufficient partnership units.  His explanation for these holdings
    is found in the following paragraphs of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[8]       … Clearly the April 9, 2001 agreement
    was intended by Sentinel Hill to be an operative document setting out the
    rules and guidelines within which it and its contracting parties should operate
    pending production of a formal written contract.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[11]     … What the contract called for was that
    Sentinel Hill and Leader Media Productions Ltd. agreed “to complete the proposed
    transactions (the “Transactions”) in respect of all theatrical motion picture
    and/or television productions principal photography for which will occur
    primarily in Canada during 2001 … materially on the basis described in the
    advance Income Tax Ruling (the “Ruling”) dated December 13, 2000.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[13]     If one works one’s way through the intricate
    obstacle course erected by the tax department, one can see that there are
    several “agreements” required in order to meet the various requirements of
    the department raised at certain stages.  They are, however, in my view,
    peripheral to the main agreement which was to “complete the proposed transactions”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[15]     … The money that the master limited partnership
    paid for the production limited partnership units would be used for a number
    of purposes, including payment of the co-ordination fee. It is likely that
    most of the production people on their side of this process understood that
    the money that was to pay their co-ordination fee would come from these payments.  Certainly
    that was Mr. Liconti’s evidence.  It was the position of the defendant that
    the payment of their fee was contingent upon there being a successful sale
    at the other end, and that if there was no such successful sale, the loss
    would be borne by them.  I see nothing in the agreement which makes this
    a condition to the producers.  Certainly they understood that the payment
    was to be forthcoming out of the proceeds of the sale, but I see nothing
    that suggests that they were in agreement that they were to bear any losses
    that might be incurred if the sales were unsuccessful.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     In my view, it was not a condition of
    the agreement between the plaintiff and any of the defendants that the plaintiff
    would be required to bear any losses caused by a reversal in the market.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from these paragraphs that the trial judge considered the appellants’
    arguments and rejected them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also,
    in my view, the trial judge adequately addressed the appellants’ alternative
    argument that the law will not permit one party to enforce a contractual
    term that it knows the other party had not agreed to.  In this respect, the
    appellants argued that the respondent knew and understood that the money
    to pay the 6% fee was to come from the proceeds of the sale of partnership
    units.  They place much emphasis on the following piece of testimony from
    Mr. Carlo Liconti, the principal witness for the respondent:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>So
    you understood that the payment of the six percent fee was dependent upon
    investors purchasing these partnership units, correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That is correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants say this is clear evidence that the respondent knew and understood
    that the appellants’ obligation to pay the 6% fee was conditional on the
    sale of sufficient partnership units.  The trial judge did not agree.  Rather,
    he concluded that while the respondent understood the money to pay the fee
    would come from the sale of partnership units, there was nothing in the agreement
    to the effect that the respondent would bear the loss if sales were unsuccessful.  This
    was a finding the trial judge was entitled to make on the record and is a
    complete answer to this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span><b>(ii)      <i>The
        letter agreement was not conditional on the respondent completing certain
        preliminary steps</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants also argued that their obligation to pay the 6% fee was conditional
    on the respondent completing certain critical preliminary steps, including
    setting up corporations, handling the corporations’ finances in a particular

    evidence at trial was that all of the documents which the appellants required
    to close were in the appellants’ hands by about December 10, 2001.  Although
    the appellants argue that the respondent had failed to provide the necessary “cheque
    stock”, their own witness admitted this was not required for closing.  Further,
    in terms of completing certain preliminary steps, the respondent was simply
    following what was done when it had successfully closed an earlier production
    with the appellants called “The Red Door”.  The trial judge found that proper
    documentation had been exchanged at that closing.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge did not make a specific finding that the necessary documentation

    my view, the principle of mitigation is not triggered in this case.  On these
    facts, the respondent did not have an opportunity to reduce the appellants’ liability.  Regardless
    of whether the respondent accepted the appellants’ offer and sued for the
    balance, or simply sued for the entire 6%, the amount payable to the respondent
    remained the same.  I accept the respondent’s following submission made in
    its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>            </span>The appellants argued
    at trial that, because the respondent refused to accept less than it was
    entitled to under the Contract, the respondent forfeited its entitlement

    of mitigation. The controlling authority is <i>Red Deer College v. Michaels</i>,<a

    the close of evidence it was agreed among counsel and the trial judge that
    the parties would file written argument and thereafter would attend before
    the trial judge for oral argument.  The following exchange took place in
    the final minutes of the trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            Well, what do you want to
    do about argument?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         Well, subject to what you
    say, Your Honour, what we propose is this that, picking up on your suggestion
    that we file with you written submissions, and if we could do that fairly
    quickly, and we would have between us an agreement as to the page length
    as well so that you don’t end up with an epic from both of us.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            All right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         And that what we had hoped
    was, if this is okay with you, is to find a half day somewhere, even if it’s
    in the early fall, where we can argue.  Here is our thought, but I leave
    it to you, that we would get our written submissions in by a week Monday.  It’s
    a long weekend.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MS. ROSENTHAL:   Tuesday</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         So it would be the Tuesday
    then, that’s July the 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            All right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         My friend would have a week
    to respond which would be July the 11<sup>th</sup>.  We would be able to
    get our reply in a week later, July the 18<sup>th</sup> and each of us would
    provide you with a maximum of 30 pages of written submissions and our reply
    would be eight pages, to a maximum of eight.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            All right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         But does that make sense?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            Oh, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         And that we would have that
    completed then by July the 18<sup>th</sup> and if we could then find – we
    just thought it would be useful to have a half day somewhere in case you
    had some questions or – I don’t know when you’re sitting, but we wouldn’t
    want you to do it at a time you’re not sitting.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            I’ll have to think about
    it.  Are you both going away in July or either of you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         I won’t be away after July
    18?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            You will or won’t.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         Will not.  So I’m available
    in July.  I’m away the week of August the 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            I’m going to be away all
    August.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. PALIARE:         Okay.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 14, 2006, the trial judge’s secretary telephoned counsel and set the
    date of October 10, 2006 for oral argument. On October 6, 2006, four days
    before oral argument was scheduled, counsel were informed by the court office
    that the trial judge was ill in hospital and would be unable to hear oral
    argument as scheduled.  It was agreed the matter would have to be adjourned
    to spring.  On October 20, 2006, the trial judge issued his reasons for judgment
    without the parties having presented oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argue that the failure to give counsel an opportunity to make
    argument is a denial of natural justice and entitles them to a new trial.  The
    appellants rely on this court’s decision in <i>Felker v. Felker</i>, [1946]
    O.W.N. 368.  The Ontario Weekly Notes summarized the court’s decision in <i>Felker</i> as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the conclusion of the argument, the Court delivered
    judgment orally, allowing the appeal and directing a new trial, on the sole
    ground that the trial judge had pronounced judgment before according to counsel
    the right to present argument, and that the defendant had thus been deprived
    of her substantive right to have her case fully presented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present case, the appellants had the opportunity to make written submissions
    but argue those were subject to a page limit and submitted on the understanding
    that there would be an opportunity for oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    on the facts of this case, I am not convinced that the absence of oral argument
    has resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    cases relied on by the appellant all involve factual situations where the
    right to present argument – in either oral or written format – was denied
    entirely.  However, this is not a situation where the appellants were denied
    entirely their right to present argument. In this case, the appellants were
    afforded the opportunity to file thirty pages of written argument.  Also,
    the affidavit material filed on the mistrial application following receipt
    of the reasons for judgment does not disclose anything the appellants would
    have done differently or in addition had they been afforded the opportunity
    for oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, while it might have been preferable had the trial judge followed
    the original plan, on the particular facts of this case his failure to do
    so has not resulted in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The
    interchange between the trial judge and counsel indicates that in this case
    the purpose of oral argument was to address any questions of the trial judge.  It
    was not primarily to give the parties an opportunity to make submissions
    as they had already been given that opportunity through their written submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    this court recently noted in <i>FL Receivables Trust 2002-A (Administrator
    of) v. Cobrand Foods Ltd.</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 561 at paras. 17 and 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[17]     Not every error by a trial judge entitles
    an aggrieved party to a new trial.  Section 134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i> stipulates that this court should order a new trial only where
    “some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”. This stringent
    standard reflects the underlying policy that new trials ordinarily are contrary
    to the public interest.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[22]     Second, and critically important, Robert
    Laba [the appellant] has not shown that if he had been given an opportunity

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    given the opportunity to present additional oral argument, I am not satisfied
    the result would have been different.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>3.   Trial Judge’s Inability to Follow the Evidence (Fresh Evidence Application)</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants have moved in this court to admit fresh affidavit evidence showing
    that the trial judge was unable to follow the evidence because he fell asleep
    repeatedly during the trial.  The fresh evidence consists of five affidavits
    authored by appellants’ trial counsel and others.  These affidavits suggest
    the trial judge fell asleep frequently but for only very brief periods of
    time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    oral argument counsel for the appellants said that the subject matter of
    the fresh evidence application did not constitute a separate independent
    ground of appeal.  Rather, he said it should be considered contextually in
    relation to the other two substantive grounds raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent says that the fresh evidence does not meet the <i>R. v. Palmer </i>test.  It
    says this evidence was available at the time of trial and that the appellants
    decided, as a matter of tactics, not to raise it at trial and preferred instead
    to “wait and see how things played out”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    the respondent’s argument, I would admit the fresh evidence because it relates
    to the validity of the trial process.  As the majority of this court said
    in <i>R. v. Rajaeefard</i> (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 323 at 325: “Where the new
    evidence sought to be admitted is relevant to the validity of the trial process
    itself, rather than directed at a finding made at trial, it is admissible.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Widdifield </i>(1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161 at 169, this court explained
      that the criteria ordinarily applied to determine the admissibility of
      fresh evidence do not apply when the evidence challenges the validity of
      the trial process:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <i>Palmer</i> criteria, do not, however, apply
    to all situations where fresh evidence is offered on appeal. Those criteria
    reflect the balancing of competing considerations relevant to the interests
    of justice when fresh evidence is offered to attack a determination made
    at trial. The same criteria cannot necessarily be applied where, as here,
    the fresh evidence is offered for a different purpose.  The material sought
    to be admitted here is not directed at a finding made at trial, but instead
    challenges the very validity of the trial process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    even where the fresh evidence is admissible, on the particular facts of this
    case, in my view, it does not assist the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants deliberately did not raise with the trial judge their
    concern that he might have been sleeping.  Instead they made a deliberate
    tactical decision to in effect – as respondent’s counsel put it – “hedge
    their bets”.  Instead of confronting the trial judge, after discussions among
    appellants’ counsel (including a senior litigator at the firm who remained
    at the office and was not directly involved in the trial <i>per se</i>),
    they made a deliberate decision not to raise the issue.  As Mr. Bradley Sherman
    put it in his affidavit, they decided to “wait and see how things played
    out”.  Presumably, if the trial result was in their favour they would do
    nothing; if not, they would have this additional evidence to use as a basis
    for appeal arguing that they were denied the right to a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    after the reasons for judgment were released, the appellants did not base
    their motion for a mistrial on the drowsiness of the trial judge nor did
    they even raise the issue.  The mistrial motion was based solely on the fact
    that the appellants had been denied the opportunity to make oral argument
    in addition to written argument.  Only in this court, for the first time,
    is the issue raised that the trial judge was inattentive to the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    appears to be little case law on point.  In fact, the parties have only drawn
    the court’s attention to two similar cases.  The first is a case decided
    by the Australian Queensland Court of Appeal.  The second is a recent decision
    from the Alberta Court of Appeal which was only released several weeks after
    this appeal was argued.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the Queensland Court of Appeal case, <i>Stathooles v. Mount Isa Mines Limited</i>,
    [1997] 2 Qd. R. 106  the allegations were that the trial judge had dozed
    off or slept during part of the evidence.  In making its decision, the court
    stressed the fact that the alleged drowsiness was not raised with the trial
    judge at any time during the trial, and dismissed the appeal.   Macrossan

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A broad discretion does exist for an appellate

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The exercise of the discretion to order a new trial
    on the basis that a miscarriage of justice has occurred may require a wide
    view to be taken of the circumstances but it is necessary to remember that
    our adversarial system requires parties to proceedings to accept responsibility
    for their own actions deliberately and consciously taken. Decisions taken
    by parties with a full awareness of relevant matters can strongly influence
    the way in which the discretion in cases of an alleged miscarriage of justice
    will be exercised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Macrossan
    C.J. then went on to quote from a joint judgment of the High Court of Australia
    in the case of <i>Vakauta v. Kelly</i> (1989), 167 C.L.R. 568 at 572:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] party who has legal representation is not entitled
    to stand by until the contents of the final judgment are known and then,
    if those contents prove unpalatable, attack the judgment on the ground that,
    by reason of those earlier comments, there has been a failure to observe
    the requirement of the appearance of impartial judgment. By standing by,
    such a party has waived the right subsequently to object.  The reason why
    that is so is obvious.  In such a case, if clear objection had been taken
    to the comments at the time when they were made or the judge had then been
    asked to refrain from further hearing the matter, the judge may have been
    able to correct the wrong impression of bias which had been given or alternatively
    may have refrained from further hearing.  It would be unfair and wrong if
    failure to object until the contents of the final judgment were known were
    to give the party in default  the advantage of an effective choice between
    acceptance and rejection of the judgment and to subject the other party to
    a situation in which it was likely that the judgment would be allowed to
    stand only if it proved to be unfavourable to him or her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s argument in <i>Stathooles</i> was that the determination of the
    case turned on the credibility of witnesses and that the judge had been especially
    inattentive during the cross-examination of Stathooles, yet made a finding
    adverse to him.  It was argued that the conclusion reached may have been
    different had there been no failure on the part of the trial judge to observe
    and listen to that witness throughout his testimony.  In reaching a conclusion
    Macrossan C.J. noted at pp. 112-113:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The lack of reaction here by counsel fully aware
    of the situation is of importance from a different point of view.  It cannot
    be accepted that there is an entitlement to do nothing at the time, hold
    the point in reserve until the decision is given and then, since it has proved
    to be adverse to the appellants, seek to set it aside.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the present case, if what is alleged to have
    occurred is sufficient to constitute a significant defect in the proceedings,
    it should have been drawn to the attention of the trial judge at the time
    it occurred.  To experienced counsel there should have been no difficulty
    other than perhaps some slight embarrassment in being required to draw the
    judge’s attention to the concern that was felt that he may be missing an
    important feature of the evidence.  Experienced professional advocates may
    be called on to display conduct which will need to be more robust than that
    in their day to day practice in the courts.  There should have been no fear
    that what needed to be done could not have been handled with the customary
    courtesy that should, and usually does, prevail between judge and counsel
    in the hearing of cases.</p>

    second case, <i>R. v. Chan</i>, [2007] A.J. No. 1522, was only released by
    the Alberta Court of Appeal after this appeal was heard.  In this case, during
    the sentencing hearing, court staff noticed that the trial judge appeared
    to be sleeping during the appellant’s testimony.  The judge was awakened
    and adjourned the proceedings.  The appellant then applied for a mistrial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    argument on the mistrial, the trial judge advised that he had fallen asleep
    because of a medical condition.  The appellant then filed an affidavit alleging
    that the trial judge’s posture while sleeping was the same as it had been
    during critical points of the trial.  The trial judge refused to grant a
    mistrial, stating that lawyers are obligated to raise inattentiveness in
    a judge when they notice it.  He directed another judge to deal with sentencing.  The
    appellant appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>  </span>Although
    the Court of Appeal ultimately allowed the appeal on other grounds, it rejected
    the appellant’s inattentiveness argument for the same reasons discussed above.  Speaking
    for the court, Ritter J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19]     We conclude that Nicholas has failed to
    demonstrate that he suffered prejudice at the trial stage of these proceedings.
    The trial judge fell asleep during the testimony at the sentencing stage
    of the trial, several months after all evidence relating to Nicholas' guilt
    had been adduced. An accused person must, at a minimum, show a real danger
    of prejudice before judicial inattentiveness, that is sleeping, will call
    for the results of his trial to be set aside. [for authority, see <i>Cesan
    v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i> (CTH), [2007] NSWCCA 273 at paras.
    190ff] In this case, Nicholas' affidavit accomplishes, at most, speculation
    that the trial judge's similar posture during the trial must mean he was
    asleep.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20]     Nicholas' affidavit does not identify
    exactly when he noticed this posture, so it is impossible to determine whether
    any crucial issues were being dealt with at the time. Moreover, it is incumbent
    upon counsel to immediately draw a trial judge's inattentiveness to his attention,
    so as to permit replacement testimony or other corrective procedures during
    the course of the trial. It is not enough, nor is it appropriate, to note
    the inattentive episode and then hold it on reserve in the event the result
    at trial was less than what is hoped for. We do not suggest that is what
    occurred here, but the effect is the same, whether the withholding of the
    concern was advertent or inadvertent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the same reasoning must apply here.  While appellants’ trial counsel
    was not experienced (this was her first trial), the record discloses that
    she did consult with senior litigation counsel in her firm about the judge’s
    inattention.  Together they made the decision to do nothing about it at the
    time but to, as respondent’s counsel put it, “roll the dice”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    was obliged to bring the trial judge’s inattention home to him at the time.  Not
    having done so, and having decided to wait and see what happened, they cannot
    now raise that inattention for the first time as a ground of appeal on either
    a substantive or contextual basis.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>

    the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    to the respondent are fixed in the sum of $35,000.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
