    Braiden had worked for La-Z-Boy Canada Limited for almost 23 years when La-Z-Boy
    ended the employment relationship.  Termination was effected pursuant to
    a sixty-day notice provision in an agreement between La-Z-Boy and Gordon
    Braiden Sales Inc. (“Sales Inc.”), a corporation owned by Mr. Braiden.  Mr.
    Braiden and Sales Inc. are collectively referred to as the Respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Braiden successfully sued La-Z-Boy for wrongful dismissal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a four-day trial, Sills J. found that, given the extent of La-Z-Boy’s control
    over the Respondents’ functions and activities, an employer and employee
    relationship existed between La-Z-Boy and Mr. Braiden.  He also held that
    the sixty-day notice provision was null and void.  In light of Mr. Braiden’s
    age (53) and years of service to La-Z-Boy, the trial judge held that a reasonable
    notice period was twenty months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>La-Z-Boy
    appeals.  It argues that there was no employer-employee relationship between
    it and the Respondents.  Rather, it says, at the time of termination its
    relationship was only with Sales Inc. and Sales Inc. worked for it as an
    independent contractor, not as an employee.  Further, La-Z-Boy contends that
    it was entitled to end the contractual relationship it had with Sales Inc.
    on sixty days’ notice.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    letter dated August 7, 1987, from La-Z-Boy, Mr. Braiden was advised that
    effective August 29, 1987, his training period and employment were at an
    end.  The letter went on to state that effective August 30, 1987, he would
    become a commissioned sales representative for La-Z-Boy (“sales agent”).  As
    a result, La-Z-Boy ceased paying him a salary and commission.  Instead, his
    compensation was based on commissions alone.  All other aspects of his employment,
    including those set out in the immediately preceding paragraph, remained
    the same as when he had been a sales agent trainee.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1995, La-Z-Boy decided that it would enter into annual written agreements
    with its sales agents.  It prepared an “Independent Sales &amp; Marketing
    Consultant’s Agreement”
    which it required all its sales agents to sign (the “Agreement”).     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first such Agreement that Mr. Braiden signed was dated January 1, 1996.  The
    Agreement contained a significant and new notice provision: either party
    could terminate the Agreement, without cause, on sixty days notice in writing
    to the other.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Braiden testified that he felt he had to sign the Agreement in order to keep
    his job.  Iain Douglas testified on behalf of Mr. Braiden.  Mr. Douglas joined
    La-Z-Boy in 1983 as Canadian sales manager and remained with it until June
    2001.  Mr. Braiden reported to Mr. Douglas for the duration of Mr. Douglas’ employment
    with La-Z-Boy.  Mr. Douglas confirmed that Mr. Braiden had to sign the Agreement
    or lose his job.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement made no changes to Mr. Braiden’s job responsibilities, the way
    in which he did his job, or his compensation.  The evidence showed that the
    Agreement was a response to audits of La-Z-Boy conducted in respect of Employer
    Health Tax (EHT) and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB).  The
    audits led government agencies to conclude that the sales agents were La-Z-Boy
    employees and La-Z-Boy was required to make EHT and WSIB contributions accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement stated that the “Independent Sales &amp;
    Marketing Consultant” was not an agent or employee of La-Z-Boy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Braiden executed similar agreements annually from 1996 to 2003.  However,
    in 1997, La-Z-Boy required Mr. Braiden to incorporate a company and to pay
    his own EHT and WSIB premiums.  As a result, Mr. Braiden established Sales
    Inc. and the 1998 annual Agreement was between La-Z-Boy and Sales Inc.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    Mr. Braiden understood that failure to comply with these requirements would
    result in the loss of his job. As before, there was no change in his working
    relationship, the way in which he performed his job, or the manner in which
    he was compensated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, La-Z-Boy urged Mr. Braiden to share office facilities and staff with
    two other sales agents in the area and he did so.  Consequently, he stopped
    working from his home and began paying his share of the associated expenses.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    annual Agreements contained detailed provisions governing Mr. Braiden’s functions
    and responsibilities.  As many of these requirements are included in the
    findings of the trial judge which are set out below, I will not repeat them
    here.  Suffice to say that under the terms of the Agreements, La-Z-Boy paid
    Mr. Braiden at a commission rate established by it, on sales as defined by
    it.  Mr. Braiden was obliged to personally engage, on a full time basis,
    in such sales promotional activities as La-Z-Boy, in its sole discretion,
    deemed advisable.  In addition, Mr. Braiden agreed to service a territory
    established by La-Z-boy and to sell exclusively La-Z-Boy furniture.  He was
    precluded from selling any competing or non-competing product lines, without
    La-Z-Boy’s consent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2003, La-Z-Boy, relying on the notice provision in the Agreement, terminated
    Mr. Braiden’s contract on sixty days’ notice.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recognized that there were two issues that required resolution
    when deciding whether the Respondents were entitled to reasonable notice.  First,
    what was the nature of the relationship that existed between the parties
    at the time of termination?  Second, what was the consequence of Sales Inc.,
    rather than Mr. Braiden, entering into the annual Agreements after 1997?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    deciding the first issue, the trial judge began by noting that application
    of the label of “independent contractor” in the Agreement was not determinative
    of the nature of the relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    para. 35 of the reasons, the trial judge made detailed findings about the
    nature of the relationship, findings which warrant being set out in full
    despite their length.  </p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[35] What does the evidence before the court indicate
    about the relationship?</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Braiden was in fact an employee from the date
    he joined the defendant on August 4, 1981 until the completion of the training
    period as sales representative on August 29, 1987.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) By letter dated August 7, 1987 (Exhibit One,
    Tab 5), he was told that his employment by the defendant would end effective
    August 29, 1987.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) That same letter advised Braiden that he would
    become a “commissioned sales agent” on August 30, 1987 and his remuneration
    thereafter was set out.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) During the years 1987 through 1997, the terms
    of Gordon Braiden’s relationship with the defendant remained the same as
    established by the defendant.  Thereafter, “Annual Independent Sales and
    Marketing Consultants’
    Agreements’ set out the terms of a relationship between the corporate plaintiff
    and the defendant, which remained the same, except for registration by Braiden’s
    corporation under EHT and WSIB, GST registration February 27, 1998 by the
    corporate plaintiff (Exhibit One, tab 13), and execution of annual agreements
    by the plaintiff corporation from 1998 to 2003.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) Commission payments from and including 1998
    were made to the plaintiff corporation by the defendant.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6) The annual “independent sales and marketing
    consultants” agreements after 1997 were entered into by the plaintiff corporation
    but paragraphs 3(i) and (j) provided for compensation to the plaintiff corporation
    only when the “principal” of the independent sales and marketing consultant
    was actively involved in the performance of the duties of the consultant.  Nowhere
    in any of the annual agreements is the “principal” of the independent sales
    and marketing agent identified or otherwise defined but obviously, in this
    case it can only refer to Gordon Braiden.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(7) The defendant was solely responsible for fixing
    compensation of the plaintiff corporation.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(8) The defendant was solely responsible for sales
    and promotional activities and required the co-operation of the agent in
    that regard.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(9) The Plaintiff corporation as a [S]ales and
    Marketing Consultant agreed to accept compensation as fixed by the defendant
    and to pay all expenses incurred in the performance of its duties and obligations
    under the agreements.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(10) The defendant required the agent to service
    its territory by calling regularly on established accounts, establishing
    new accounts and using its best efforts on behalf of the defendant and its
    products.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(11) The said agent was restrained from selling
    or promoting competing lines of merchandise and even non-competing lines
    of merchandise, absent the consent of the defendant, and as included in a
    schedule to the agreement.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(12) The said agent was to be responsible to the
    defendant’s sales department to maintain and improve sales volume of the
    defendant’s products within the territory assigned and failure to adequately
    service accounts may result in a withholding or adjusting of compensation
    in the discretion of the defendant.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(13) The agent is to accept and follow the information

    satisfactory to the defendant and to maintain its place of business within
    the territory unless otherwise agreed to by the defendant in writing.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(15) The agent is to attend, at its own expense,
    trade shows, furniture markets and other events where, in the opinion of
    the defendant, attendance is appropriate, and to attend the defendant’s display
    space at such events on a daily basis to service the defendant’s customers.  Presumably,
    all attendances, including calls on customers, were to be by the “principal” Gordon
    Braiden.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(16) The agent is to attend at the defendant’s

    agreement specifically describes the relationship with the defendant as independent
    sales and marketing consultant, and not an agent of the defendant.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(20) The defendant was able to modify and change
    the terms of the agreement in its own discretion at any time on 60 days notice

    and insurance benefit plans subject to the consent of defendant’s insurer
    and at its own expense.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(22) No prior discussions between the parties had
    occurred with respect to the provisions of the agreement and certainly the
    60-day notice of termination was a new provision from inception of the annual
    agreement.</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(23) The defendant controlled the work to be done

    contractors lie at the other end.  He suggested that a third category of
    relationship has emerged, between those two points, in which reasonable notice
    of termination must also be given.   He referred to <i>Marbry Distributors
    Ltd.  v. Avrecan International Inc. </i> (1999), 171 D.L.R. (4th) 436 (B.C.C.A.)
    for this proposition, noting that in <i>Marbry</i>, the British Columbia

    relation to the second issue, the trial judge recognized that from 1998 to
    the time of termination the Agreements were between Sales Inc. and La-Z-Boy
    and, in that sense, there was no direct relationship between Mr. Braiden
    and La-Z-Boy.  Nonetheless, he refused to attach significance to what he
    viewed as the
    “technical structure” of the arrangement.  As he explained, all of the Agreements
    recognized the ongoing participation of Mr. Braiden as a necessary “principal” of
    Sales Inc., La-Z-Boy relied on Mr. Braiden’s presence as Sales Inc.’s principal,
    and the Agreements were entirely dependent on Mr. Braiden’s personal involvement.  He
    found that Sales Inc. was used, at La-Z-Boy’s insistence, simply as a vehicle
    to transfer financial obligations from La-Z-Boy to Mr. Braiden and “to attempt
    to create in the plaintiff the status of independent contractor for purposes
    of termination of the contract and avoidance of reasonable notice thereof
    and claims for wrongful dismissal”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that it did not matter whether the plaintiff was Mr.
    Braiden or Sales Inc. when determining the length of the reasonable notice
    period.  Mr. Braiden was “vulnerable” as an employee, in the sense that word
    was used in <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R.
    701.  Further, it was clear from the reference to “principal” in each of
    the annual Agreements that it was Mr. Braiden whom La-Z-Boy considered to
    be the “prime mover” of the corporate plaintiff.  Accordingly, </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[43]  … Given the extent
    of control held and exercised by the defendant regarding the functions and
    activities of the plaintiffs, the annual agreements, although said to be
    agreements with an independent sales and marketing consultant, represented
    an employment relationship between the defendant and Gordon Braiden, either
    directly or through the plaintiff corporation.  As stated earlier, it does
    not matter whether the plaintiff is the individual, Gordon Braiden, or his
    corporation, in determining the notice period.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    Globe and Mail </i>(1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.J.) for determining
    the length of the notice period.  Based on the length of service, Mr. Braiden’s
    age, and the difficulty he could expect to encounter in finding comparable
    employment, the trial judge found that a reasonable notice period was twenty
    months.  </p>

    relationship existed between it and Mr. Braiden.  It submits that its employment
    relationship with Mr. Braiden was terminated in 1987 when he became a sales
    agent for La-Z-Boy.  After 1997, La-Z-Boy says, its only relationship was
    with Sales Inc. and Sales Inc. was an independent contractor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>La-Z-Boy’s
    submission that its relationship was with Sales Inc. alone can be answered
    shortly.  Where an individual is providing services pursuant to an agreement,
    the fact that the individual is paid through his or her corporation is not
    determinative of whether an employment relationship exists with the individual.  See <i>Kordish
    v. Innotech Multimedia Corp.</i> (1998), 46 C.C.E.L. (2d) 318 (Ont. Ct. J.

    <st1:country-region

    ).  On the record, there is no other conclusion available but that La-Z-Boy
    used the Agreements to secure the personal services of Mr. Braiden, as sales
    agent, even though the Agreements in the later years of the relationship
    were with Mr. Braiden’s corporation.      </p>

      set out what it considered to be a persuasive approach to the issue:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her
    own equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the financial

    refused, [1986] S.C.C.A. No. 73, 64 N.R. 318n, the trial judge identified
    the following principles to distinguish independent contractors from employees
    when considering the status of a commissioned agent:</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the agent was limited exclusively to the service of the principal;</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the agent is subject to the control of the principal, not only as
    to the product sold, but also as to when, where and how it is sold;</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the agent has an investment or interest in what are characterized
    as the “tools” relating to his service;</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the agent has undertaken any risk in the business sense or, alternatively,
    has any expectation of profit associated with the delivery of his service
    as distinct from a fixed commission;</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i>Whether
    or not the activity of the agent is part of the business organization of
    the principal for which he works.  <i>In other words, whose business is it?   </i>[Emphasis
    added.]<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    many ways, the question posed at the end of the fifth principle – whose business
    is it? – lies at the heart of the matter.  Was the individual carrying on
    business for him or herself or was the individual carrying on the business
    of the organization from which he or she was receiving compensation?  In
    my view, given the findings of the trial judge, the answer to that question
    can only be that Mr. Braiden was carrying on the business of La-Z-Boy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    of the five principles in <i>Belton</i> point unequivocally to an employment
    relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1.         As required by
    the terms of the Agreements, Mr. Braiden worked full-time and exclusively
    for La-Z-Boy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2.         Mr. Braiden was
    subject to La-Z-Boy’s control not only as to the products sold but also as
    to the territory in which they were to be sold and the promotional methods
    he was to use.  Mr. Braiden’s sales obligations were completely determined
    by La-Z-Boy – where he was to sell, the promotional methods he was to use,
    what he was to sell and how much he was to sell it for.  La-Z-Boy regularly
    monitored Mr. Braiden’s sales performance and measured it against the performance
    of other of La-Z-Boy’s sales agents. Sales goals, performance directions
    and reviews were all determined and conducted exclusively by La-Z-Boy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>4.         Mr. Braiden’s
    financial compensation consisted solely of his commissions from La-Z-Boy.  La-Z-Boy
    established the commission levels, the price of the products that Mr. Braiden
    sold and the territories and accounts which Mr. Braiden was to service.  Mr.
    Braiden was restrained from selling or promoting competing and non-competing
    product lines.  He was financially dependent on La-Z-Boy and had no expectation
    that he might earn a profit as distinct from the fixed commissions he received
    from La-Z-Boy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>5.         The group of
    sales agents of which Mr. Braiden was a member was the central method by
    which La-Z-Boy distributed and sold its products.  Accordingly, the sales
    force of which Mr. Braiden was a member was a crucial element of La-Z-Boy’s
    business organization.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not clear to me that the third principle is applicable to this case as
    there are no “tools” associated with Mr. Braiden’s work as a sales agent.  If “tools”
    includes anything necessary to perform one’s contractual responsibilities,
    it would encompass Mr. Braiden’s car and office, both of which he furnished
    and maintained at his own expense.  On that view of “tools”, the third principle
    is more indicative of an independent contractor than of an employment relationship.  However,
    this is but one factor and, in the circumstances of this case, it is far
    less significant than the others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I see no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s determination
    that the continued relationship between the appellant and Mr. Braiden was
    that of employer and employee.  This determination was based on careful,
    thorough findings of fact which are fully supported on the record, and was
    responsive to the issues raised by the parties.  Although the reasons do
    not identify the factors set out above, the findings reflect a consideration
    of the appropriate factors.  </p>

    pursuant to s. 57 of the ESA, Mr. Braiden would have been entitled to a minimum
    notice period of eight weeks.  As the Notice Provision requires that sixty
    days’ notice be given and sixty days exceeds eight weeks, I accept La-Z-Boy’s
    submission that the Notice Provision met the minimum notice period prescribed
    by the ESA.  Accordingly, the trial judge erred in holding that the Notice
    Provision was void because it provided for less notice than the statutory
    minimum prescribed by the ESA.  </p>

    Respondents argue that the trial judge may have been considering severance,

    of the statutory minimums prescribed by the ESA.  This argument is based
    on the fact that, pursuant to s. 64(1) of the ESA, Mr. Braiden was entitled
    to severance as well as to notice.  Section 64(1) stipulates that an employer “who
    severs an employment relationship with an employee shall pay severance pay
    to the employee” in certain circumstances.  One such circumstance is where
    the employer’s payroll is $2.5 million or more (s. 64(1)(b)).<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    that La-Z-Boy’s annual payroll is $2.5 million or more, the Respondents argue
    that once the trial judge determined that an employment relationship existed
    between La-Z-Boy and Mr. Braiden, he would have recognized that pursuant
    to s. 64(1)(b), La-Z-Boy was obliged to provide Mr. Braiden with severance
    pay, as well as notice.  They submit that as the Agreement was silent in
    respect of severance, it was open to the trial judge to have concluded that
    the Agreement was intended to provide Mr. Braiden with no severance.  Thus,
    they argue, although the Notice Provision met the statutory minimum, if an
    employment contract must provide no less than the statutory minimum in respect
    of both notice and severance, it was open to the trial judge to have found
    that the Agreement was void as it provided less than the minimum severance
    requirement prescribed by the ESA.  </p>

    it is not necessary to decide this appeal on the basis of whether silence
    in the Agreement on the matter of severance amounts to a failure to meet
    the prescribed minimum standards in the ESA.  This is a novel and important
    point of law.  Its determination is best left to a case in which the matter

    with <i>Francis v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce </i>(1994), 21 O.R.
    (3d) 75 at 84, this court has repeatedly held that a new notice provision
    in a contract is “a tremendously significant modification of the implied
    term of reasonable notice”, one that requires consideration flowing from
    the employer to support it.  Accordingly, it is clear that consideration
    was required to support the Agreement which contained, for the first time,
    the Notice Provision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    requirement of consideration to support a change to the terms of an agreement
    is especially important in the employment context where, generally, there
    is inequality of bargaining power between employees and employers.  Some
    employees may enjoy a measure of bargaining power when negotiating the terms
    of prospective employment but once they have been hired and are dependent
    on the remuneration of the job, they become more vulnerable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognition
    of this vulnerability is now so firmly embedded in the jurisprudence that
    it need hardly be recited.  In <i>Ceccol v. Ontario Gymnastic Federation </i>(2001),
    55 O.R. (3d) 614 at paras. 47 - 48 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), MacPherson J.A. summarized the jurisprudence in the following terms:</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In an important line of cases in recent years,
    the Supreme Court of Canada has discussed, often with genuine eloquence,
    the role work plays in a person’s life, the imbalance in many employer-employee
    relationships and the desirability of interpreting legislation and the common
    law to provide a measure of protection to vulnerable employees [citations
    omitted].</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These factors have clearly influenced the interpretation
    of employment contracts.  In <i>Wallace</i>, Iacobucci J. said, at pp. 740-41:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The contract of employment has many characteristics
    that set it apart from the ordinary commercial contract.  Some of the views
    on this subject that have already been approved of in previous decisions
    of this Court (see e.g. <i>Machtinger, supra</i>) bear repeating.  As K.
    Swinton noted in “Contract Law and the Employment Relationship: The Proper
    Forum for Reform”, in B.J. Reiter and J. Swan, eds., <i>Studies in Contract
    Law </i>(1980), 357, at p. 363:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>… the terms of the employment contract rarely
    result from an exercise of free bargaining power in the way that the paradigm
    commercial exchange between two traders does.  Individual employees on the
    whole lack both the bargaining power and the information necessary to achieve
    more favourable contract provisions than those offered by the employer, particularly
    with regard to tenure. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    promise to do something that a party to a contract is already bound to do
    is not consideration.  This was explained in <i>K.M.A. Caterers Limited v.  Howie</i>,
    [1969] 1 O.R. 131 at 134 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):                      </p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A promise to do what the promissor is bound to
    do under an existing contract cannot be consideration, for if a person gets
    nothing in return for his promise but that to which he is already legally
    entitled, the so-called consideration is not genuine and is not sufficient
    to support a contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Mr. Braiden became a sales agent for La-Z-Boy in 1987, there was no provision
    dealing with notice in the agreement between the parties, thus leaving common
    law reasonable notice as an implied term.  In 1996, after almost a decade
    of loyal service to La-Z-Boy as a sales agent, Mr. Braiden signed the Agreement.  The
    only substantive change to the parties’
    rights that came about as a consequence of entering into the Agreement related
    to the insertion of the termination provisions.  The Agreement contained,
    for the first time, the Notice Provision stipulating that Mr. Braiden’s employment
    could be terminated on sixty days’
    notice.  Sixty days was less than that which Mr. Braiden would have been
    entitled to at common law.  No clauses detrimental to La-Z-Boy’s interests
    were inserted into the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the Agreement, Mr. Braiden was obliged to continue to provide the same services
    as he had under the prior agreement and La-Z-Boy was obliged to give Mr.
    Braiden only that to which he was legally entitled under that prior agreement.  Thus,
    on the face of the Agreement, there is no indication that Mr. Braiden received
    any consideration for giving up his right to reasonable notice at common
    law.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    there is nothing in the record to show that any fresh consideration flowed
    to Mr. Braiden in exchange for his giving up that right.  Indeed, the evidence
    is to the contrary.  From 1987 through to 2003, the regular rate of commission
    that La-Z-Boy paid Mr. Braiden remained fixed at 5%.  During that period:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(a)  the commission he received on the sale of leather products was decreased
    to 4%;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(b)  in 1998 he was required to incur the expenses of incorporating Sales
    Inc., and in 1999 to assume the ongoing costs of rent for office space and
    payment of his share of the salaries of two support staff; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(c)  as a result of unilateral changes made by La-Z-Boy to Mr. Braiden’s
    territory during the period, he experienced a substantial reduction in earnings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>La-Z-Boy
    counters by arguing that forbearance from firing constitutes good consideration.  In
    support of this argument, it points to Mr. Braiden’s testimony that he entered
    into the Agreement because he understood that he might otherwise lose his
    employment with La-Z-Boy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that this court’s decision in <i>Hobbs v. TDI Canada Ltd. </i>(2004),
    246 D.L.R. (4th) 43 (

    Ct.), is a full answer to this submission.  In
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hobbs</i>, the appellant accepted a commissioned sales position with TDI.  During
    the second week of his employment with TDI, he was required to sign a Solicitor’s
    Agreement that changed his payment structure.  The trial judge opined that
    the Solicitor’s Agreement formed part of the original employment agreement.  However,
    if the Solicitor’s Agreement were a new agreement, he was of the view that
    consideration for it flowed in the form of “the continuation of employment”,
    since it was clear that Mr. Hobbs’ refusal to sign the Solicitor’s Agreement
    would have resulted in the termination of his employment.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Juriansz J.A., writing on behalf of the court, held that the trial
    judge erred.  He held that the Solicitor’s Agreement was an amendment of
    the original employment contract and that Mr. Hobbs received no consideration
    for it.  In reaching this conclusion, Juriansz J. A. reviewed a number of
    decisions of this court, all of which are to the same effect: a change in
    the notice period is a significant modification of the employment agreement,
    additional consideration is required to support such a modification and continued
    employment does not constitute something of value flowing to the employee.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    <i>Hobbs</i>, Juriansz J.A. explains:</p> <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The governing legal authority in the circumstances
    of this case is <i>Francis v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce </i>(1994),
    21 O.R. (3d) (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Francis makes it clear the law does not permit employers to present employees
    with changed terms of employment, threaten to fire them if they do not agree
    to them, and then rely on the continued employment relations as the consideration
    for the new terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    situation that Mr. Braiden faced is similar to that of Mr. Hobbs but even
    more compelling.  In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Hobbs</i>, the appellant had only worked for two weeks before being presented
    with the agreement.  Mr. Braiden had given fifteen years of loyal service
    to La-Z-Boy when he was told by his immediate supervisor that he was to sign
    the Agreement or lose his job.  Both
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Hobbs</i><i> </i>and <i>Francis </i>make it clear that continued employment,
    in such a situation, is not consideration for the new terms of the employment
    relationship.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that if an employer provides consideration beyond mere continued employment,
    the employee may be bound by the modified terms of the agreement.  <i>Techform </i>is
    a case in which additional consideration flowed.  In <i>Techform</i>, the
    court found that the employer had implicitly promised the employee that it
    would forbear from exercising its right to terminate the employee for a reasonable
    period, thus enhancing the employee’s security of employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no such finding in the present case.  Indeed, there is no evidence on
    which such a finding could be made.  La-Z-Boy chose to lead no evidence.  The
    testimony of Messrs. Braiden and Douglas, which the trial judge accepted,
    was that he was given a choice:  sign or lose your job.  There is no evidence
    that he received anything that might be considered to amount to “enhanced
    security of employment”.  All that Mr. Braiden received for signing the Agreement
    was continued employment and, as previously stated, mere continuance of employment
    is not consideration.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
    in these comments is intended to suggest that it would not have been possible
    for La-Z-Boy to have entered into a fresh agreement with Mr. Braiden with
    a notice provision of the sort in question.  However, at a minimum, in order
    to discharge the burden of establishing such a new agreement, La-Z-Boy would
    have to point to evidence that it clearly communicated the changes in the
    agreement that governed its relationship with Mr. Braiden, Mr. Braiden appreciated
    that he was giving up legal rights and consideration flowed for his forfeiture
    of those rights.       </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Are tax benefits consideration?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>La-Z-Boy
    also argued that Mr. Braiden received consideration for the Agreement as
    a result of the Agreement being between La-Z-Boy and Sales Inc.  It submitted
    that Mr. Braiden received financial benefits -- such as income splitting
    with his wife - because Mr. Braiden’s compensation flowed through his company,
    instead of directly to him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this argument for two reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Mr.
    Braiden actually received such a benefit.  In the absence of such evidence,
    given that there are costs associated with incorporating and maintaining
    a company, it is not appropriate to simply assume that whatever tax benefits
    Mr. Braiden may have enjoyed exceeded the expenses of incorporating and maintaining
    Sales Inc.  It will be recalled in this regard that Mr. Braiden only incorporated
    at the direction of La-Z-Boy.  Had incorporation been at Mr. Braiden’s insistence,
    it may have been open to infer a financial or other benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    even if it can be assumed that Mr. Braiden received a benefit, the benefit
    arose as a result of favourable tax treatment and was a collateral or incidental
    result of the Agreement.  It was not consideration that flowed from La-Z-Boy
    to Mr. Braiden.  Rather, it was a benefit that flowed from the tax authority
    as a result of the relevant taxing statute.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
