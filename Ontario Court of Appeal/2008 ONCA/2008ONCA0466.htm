    June 28, 2007, R. Gordon J. of the Superior Court of Justice granted a stay
    of proceedings after concluding that the respondent’s right to trial within
    a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> had been infringed.</p>

    Crown appeals, principally on the basis that the trial judge erred in his
    assessment of the prejudice factor that forms an important part of the constellation
    of factors that must be considered in a s. 11(b) application.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was charged with sexual assault, uttering a death threat, and
    unlawful confinement.  It is alleged that the respondent lured the complainant
    into his vehicle.  He threatened to kill her, forced her to perform fellatio,
    and then raped her.  The respondent and the complainant had previously been
    in a relationship and it is alleged that the respondent was unhappy that
    he and the complainant were no longer together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was arrested on May 10, 2005.  After several matters, including
    bail, disclosure, and a judicial pre-trial, were dealt with, a trial in the
    Ontario Court of Justice was scheduled for February 20, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    days before the scheduled trial date, the Crown received a report from the
    Centre for Forensic Sciences (“CFS”) that indicated that semen found inside
    the complainant when she went to a hospital the day after the alleged assault
    was not the respondent’s semen.  The Crown and the defence agreed that the
    defence should receive the benefit of a preliminary inquiry; accordingly,
    on February 20, 2006, the Crown re-elected to proceed by indictment and a
    preliminary inquiry was scheduled for September 15, 2006.  Defence counsel
    agreed to this date but also said: “But, obviously, it’s quite a ways down
    the road so, in the interim, I’m going to write to the court and to the Crown
    in an effort to secure an earlier date.”  Within a week, defence counsel
    sent a letter along these lines to the court and the Crown.  Neither replied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 15, 2006, the Crown chose to proceed with other cases.  These matters
    concluded at 3:16 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel indicated that it was not realistic to start the preliminary inquiry.  He
    said:
    “My colleague and I have spoken to the trial coordinator about some dates.  We’re
    unable to get any dates today that are in this year.  So, I’m concerned … Mrs.
    Gagnon is aware that there’s some urgency to this and she’ll find us a date.  There
    are two dates in December that I’m available and Mr. Waltenbury is not.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel stated: “I’ll just indicate, I’ve given Ms. Gagnon a list of all
    the available dates that I have between today and next May.  So, I believe,
    she’s going to be checking officers’ schedules and contacting counsel.  We’re
    very hopeful we can get an early date.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presiding judge, Justice W.F. Fitzgerald, observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is unfortunate that he could not be accommodated
    today, because people get ready, lawyers get ready, witnesses get ready,
    accused gets nervous, and complainants are most anxious to get matters on,
    and so is the Court, and perhaps it can be expedited to an early date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    matter was adjourned for a week until September 22, 2006.  The accused was
    represented by an agent, Ms. Baker.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The preliminary inquiry had been pre-set by counsel
    and the trial coordinator for February 5, 2007, and this was confirmed in
    a <i>pro forma</i> exchange involving Crown counsel, an agent for the defence,
    and the presiding judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry proceeded on February 5, 2007.  There were two witnesses,
    the complainant and her fiancé.  Both were cross-examined by defence counsel.  At
    the conclusion of their testimony, defence counsel conceded that “the evidence
    is sufficient on all counts for my client to stand trial as elected.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial was set in the Superior Court of Justice for November 14, 2007.  There
    were several available dates in September and October, but defence counsel
    was unavailable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel brought a <i>Charter</i> s. 11(b) application which was heard by
    the trial judge on June 20, 2007.  At the commencement of the hearing, defence
    counsel informed the trial judge: “The trial dates with respect to this matter
    were set in assignment court on June 5<sup>th</sup> of this year and unfortunately
    I inadvertently set the trial dates for a day when I’m already scheduled
    for a jury trial on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Manitoulin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island”.  The application was adjourned several minutes to allow counsel
    to consult with the trial coordinator, which resulted in a new trial date
    of December 18, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    s. 11(b) application then proceeded.  The total elapsed time from the date
    of arrest to the November 14, 2007 scheduled trial date<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> was approximately 30 months.  The trial judge
    held that “the length of delay is such that an inquiry into its reasonableness
    is justified.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conducting his inquiry, the trial judge essentially divided the 30-month
    period into three components.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first period was from the date of the charge (May 10, 2005) to the first
    scheduled trial in provincial court (February 20, 2006).  The trial judge
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Having reviewed the records of the various court
    appearances, there is little doubt that the initial adjournments through
    to the first scheduled trial of February 20, 2006 were made with the agreement
    of Mr. Godin’s counsel and without indication of any kind on any record that
    any delay was unacceptable.  Accordingly, waiver would apply to this 9 month
    period and in any event, the initial 9 month period between the date of the
    charge and the first scheduled trial falls within the acceptable guidelines
    for the disposition of charges by the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third period considered by the trial judge was the time period from the date
    of committal at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry (February 5, 2007)
    to the scheduled trial date in superior court (November 14, 2007).  Like
    the first period, the trial judge saw no s. 11(b) problem in the third period.  He
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Godin was committed for trial eventually on
    February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2007.  The delay from this point forward to the
    accepted date of trial is just more than 9 months, however, dates as early
    as September 12<sup>th</sup> were offered to Mr. Godin but were declined
    due to the unavailability of his counsel.  I find that in these circumstances
    the delay in getting the matter to trial in the Superior Court of Justice
    was about 7 months, which is certainly within the guidelines suggested by
    the Supreme Court of Canada and which is especially reasonable given the
    intervening summer months when there is less than a full complement of judges
    available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    leaves the second or middle time period, which clearly concerned the trial
    judge:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The period of greater concern is from February
    20<sup>th</sup>, 2006 when the parties first attended for the scheduled trial
    to February 5, 2007 when Mr. Godin’s preliminary hearing took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recorded that defence counsel was not available for a preliminary
    inquiry in December 2006.  Accordingly, he viewed this second period as involving
    a delay of ten months, which he described as “well beyond any reasonable
    interpretation of the guidelines promulgated by the Supreme Court of Canada.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    legal framework for a s. 11(b) analysis has been particularly well-described

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 11(b) aims to protect both the individual
    rights of the accused and the rights of society.  It protects three individual
    rights: it protects the accused’s right to security of the person by minimizing
    the anxiety and stigma of criminal proceedings; it protects the accused’s
    right to liberty by minimizing the effect of pre-trial custody or restrictive
    bail conditions; and it protects the accused’s right to a fair trial by ensuring
    that the proceedings occur while evidence is fresh and available.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 11(b) also seeks to protect two societal
    rights.  First, it protects the public’s interest in having our laws enforced
    by having those who break the law tried quickly.  Promptly held trials increase
    public confidence.  Second, s. 11(b) seeks to protect the public’s interest
    in having those accused of crime dealt with fairly.                                                                                                              [Citations

    determining whether s. 11(b) has been infringed, a court must balance these

    Supreme Court of Canada has identified a series of factors to assist in a
    s. 11(b) inquiry: (i) the length of the delay; (ii) waiver of time periods;
    (iii) the reasons for the delay, including (a) inherent time requirements
    of the case; (b) actions of the accused; (c) actions of the Crown; (d) limits
    on institutional resources, and (e) other reasons for delay; and (iv) prejudice
    to the accused: see <i>R. v. Askov</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 483-84,
    and <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 13.</p>

  <h3>                        (a) <u>Length of delay</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant period is from the day the charge is laid to the end of the trial:
    see <i>Morin</i> at p. 14.  In this case, the delay was 30 months, well above
    the upper limit of 18 months for cases involving both a preliminary inquiry
    and a trial in superior court: see <i>Morin</i> at p. 21.  The trial judge
    was correct to identify this delay as one requiring an inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the trial judge’s general assessment of the three periods
    involved in this case.  The first period, the nine months between charge
    and the scheduled trial in provincial court, was within the eight to ten
    month <i>Morin</i> guideline.  The third period, the seven months between
    the committal at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry and the time the
    trial could have proceeded in superior court, was within the six to eight
    month <i>Askov/Morin</i> guideline.  The second period, the 11 ½ months from
    re-election to the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, was troublesome,
    especially if added to the first period of nine months in the provincial
    court.</p>
  <h3>(b) <u>Waiver</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the defence had waived three different time periods.  The
    first period was the nine months from the charge to the first scheduled trial.  I
    doubt that this clears the high hurdle for waiver set by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Askov</i> and <i>Morin</i>.  However, nothing turns on this
    issue because, in my view, the trial judge’s alternative assessment of this
    period – “[it] falls within the acceptable guideline for the disposition
    of charges by the Ontario Court of Justice” – was clearly correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge identified the second period of defence waiver as the 1 ½ months
    from December 22, 2006 to February 5, 2007 because defence counsel was unavailable
    for the preliminary inquiry on the former date.  I agree.  The trial judge
    found that the third period of defence waiver was two months from September
    12, 2007 to November 14, 2007 because defence counsel was unavailable to
    start the trial in superior court on the former date.  Again, I agree.</p>
  <h3>(c) <u>Reasons for the delay</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the factors to consider in the context of the reasons for the delay is
    the actions of the accused.  In <i>Morin</i>, Sopinka J. described this factor
    in this fashion at pp. 17-18:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This aspect of the reasons for the delay should
    not be read as putting the “blame” on the accused for certain portions of
    delay.  There is no necessity to impute improper motives to the accused in
    considering this factor.  Included under this heading are all actions taken
    by the accused which may have caused delay.  In this section I am concerned
    with actions of the accused which are voluntarily undertaken.  Actions which
    could be included in this category include change of venue motions, attacks
    on wiretap packets, adjournments which do not amount to waiver, attacks on
    search warrants, etc. I do not wish to be interpreted as advocating that
    the accused sacrifice all preliminary procedures and strategy, but simply
    point out that if the accused chooses to take such action, this will be taken
    into account in determining what length of delay is reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, some of the actions of the accused and his counsel, although not
    blameworthy, tell strongly against there being an
    “unreasonable” delay in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with the book-ends in the court proceedings.  The first court date
    after defence counsel was retained was June 3, 2005.  Defence counsel was
    represented by an agent.  The agent informed the court that he expected the
    accused to be present.  The accused was paged but did not appear.  The Crown
    was reluctant to proceed in his absence and suggested a two week adjournment
    and a court order that the accused appear on June 17, 2005.  The presiding
    judge so ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the next court date, the accused did not appear in spite of the court order
    made two weeks earlier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the other book-end, namely June 20, 2007, the s. 11(b) hearing, before
    defence counsel began his submissions on s. 11(b), he indicated that he was
    seeking an adjournment of the trial scheduled for November 14, 2007 because
    it conflicted with another scheduled trial.  After discussion and a brief
    adjournment to talk to the trial coordinator, the trial was adjourned until
    December 18, 2007, with defence counsel, fairly, waiving this additional
    month and not relying on it in his s. 11(b) submissions.  However, I note
    Crown counsel’s observation about the irony of what was happening in court
    that day: “In actual fact I don’t really know how – there can be appreciation
    of that on the record for the defence to say that, well this is too long,
    but it’s going to be longer anyway.  Well what about prejudice and time going
    by.”  I have real sympathy with this observation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inside
    the book-ends of the court proceedings, there were decisions made by the
    defence that call into question its vigilance in moving the case forward.  Twice
    defence counsel declined proffered court dates because of other commitments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the time frame that the trial judge identified, correctly, as the
    only troublesome period, namely February 20, 2006 to February 5, 2007, has
    two factors pointing against an “unreasonable delay”
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the re-election to a trial in superior court coupled with a preliminary inquiry
    was done on consent and enured significantly to the respondent’s benefit.  At
    the preliminary inquiry, defence counsel was able to cross-examine the complainant
    and her fiancé to lay the groundwork for exploration at trial of the perhaps
    surprising CFS result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    on September 15, 2006, when the preliminary inquiry was not reached because
    of other matters, the judge, defence counsel and Crown counsel all recognized
    that this was a case in s. 11(b) trouble and discussed it with appropriate
    concern: see <i>R. v. R.M.</i> (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 49 at para. 9 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  This case was adjourned to “pre-set” a potential new date with the trial
    coordinator and to return to court on September 22, 2006.  On the return
    date, the preliminary inquiry was set for February 5, 2007.  Defence counsel
    was not available on an offered date of December 22, 2006.  Nor did he attend
    to voice any objection to the new date.  In these circumstances, I conclude
    that the trouble identified in court on September 15 had been discussed and
    resolved by agreement at the “pre-set” meeting between the two court dates.  If
    this was not the case, the court appearance on September 22, 2006 was the
    time for defence counsel to make a clear objection in front of the judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    emphasize that, like Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i>, I do not blame defence counsel
    for any of the conduct and decisions described above.  However, also like
    Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i>, I conclude that “if the accused chooses to take
    such action, this will be taken into account in determining what length of
    delay is reasonable.”  In my calculus, the events I have described – the
    book-ends and the events between them – do not suggest an unreasonable delay.</p>
  <h3>(d) <u>Prejudice</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    concluding his analysis of the time periods involved in the case and the
    reasons for various delays, the trial judge turned to the question of prejudice:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Under <i>Section 11(b)</i>, Mr. Godin is given
    the constitutional right to a trial within a reasonable time.  He has not
    received it and there has been prejudice as a result.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As has been found in many cases, awaiting the outcome
    of criminal charges is, in itself, a prejudice.  Mr. Godin has had the spectre
    of these charges, his pending trial and fairly strict bail conditions hanging
    over his head now for well over two years.  Since his release on May 10,
    2005, he has been directed by the court where to live, with whom and has
    been required to be in his residence by 10 o’clock each evening.  These terms
    represent significant and real restrictions on his freedom.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I have concerns with this analysis.  To begin, the trial judge confuses
    the role of prejudice in the s. 11(b) analysis quoted above.  Instead of
    considering prejudice to the accused as one of many factors to determine
    whether the trial was unreasonably delayed, the trial judge first concludes
    that s. 11(b) had been infringed and then finds as a result that the accused
    suffered prejudice.  However, the case law makes it clear that prejudice
    to the accused is to be considered before concluding whether the trial was
    unreasonably delayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I do not agree that, on the merits, the appellant’s bail conditions amount
    to any serious prejudice.  He was charged with very serious offences – a
    violent sexual assault, uttering a death threat, and unlawful confinement.  He
    has not been subject to house arrest.  In a formal sense only, he has been
    told where to live and with whom; the reality is that he has lived in his
    community and with, consecutively, a surety, his mother, and a new girlfriend.  The
    changes in these living arrangements were made at his request and with the
    Crown’s consent.  The curfew term was removed after a year, again with the
    Crown’s consent.  In short, given the very serious offences, and the allegedly
    terrifying circumstances surrounding the offences, the respondent’s bail
    is not particularly onerous.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    deal with one final point with respect to prejudice.  Although the trial
    judge did not mention it, the respondent submits that there is prejudice
    caused by the passage of time and the diminution of the memory of witnesses,
    especially the complainant’s and her fiancé’s memory of when they had sexual
    relations near the time of the alleged assault.  I disagree.  This submission
    strikes me as speculative in at least two respects – the difference in memory
    between 18 months and 30 months and whether it might enure to the benefit
    of the Crown or the defence.</p>
  <h3>(3) <u>The balance</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    return to the legal framework set out in <i>Qureshi</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the delay in this case was not unreasonable.  By and large, the
    delay was caused by a constellation of explicable factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    particularly important factor was conversion of the case from a trial in
    provincial court to a trial in superior court coupled with a preliminary
    inquiry.  This fundamental change occurred through mutual agreement of the
    Crown and defence and greatly benefitted the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    this case deserves to be heard on the merits.  As Sopinka J. said in <i>Morin</i> at
    p. 13: “As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal
    demand that the accused be brought to trial.”  The offences in this case
    are very serious and the alleged circumstances that gave rise to the criminal
    charges were, from the complainant’s perspective, violent, terrifying and
    probably deeply damaging.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the stay of proceedings, and direct that
    the matter proceed to trial.  I would request that the trial coordinator
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    have had the benefit of reading the reasons prepared by MacPherson J. A.  While
    I agree with much of what he said, I have come to a different conclusion.  It
    is appropriate that I set out those matters on which I differ, and the reasons
    behind my conclusion that the Crown’s appeal should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree both with the trial judge and with  MacPherson J. A. that it was appropriate
    to consider the thirty months which had elapsed between the laying of the
    charge and the trial date in Superior Court as falling into three component
    time periods.  I further agree that it is appropriate to consider the time
    period between the laying of the charge and the first scheduled trial date
    in Ontario Court, and the third period of time between the committal for
    trial and the Superior Court trial date as being properly accounted for as
    falling within the guidelines proposed in <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><u><span lang=EN-US>WAIVER</span></u></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Morin</i> directs
    that waiver is the first factor to consider.  I would not find that the time
    period from December 22, 2006 to February 5, 2007 was waived by the defence
    by reason of the fact that the date of December 22, 2006 was apparently offered
    as an available date to replace the postponed date of September 15, 2006,
    but defence counsel was unavailable.  The majority concludes that the trial
    judge so ruled and expresses agreement with that decision.  With respect
    I do not believe the trial judge so ruled.  At page 6 of the trial judge’s
    reasons he held “even if I attribute the time thereafter as a defence delay,
    there is still delay of ten months in conducting the preliminary hearing.”  I
    do not read this as a finding by the trial judge that it was a delay properly
    attributable to the defence, but rather the trial judge is recognizing that
    argument and in effect saying that in his view, even if that argument was
    accepted, the delay was still excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reason that I would not attribute that period of time to the defence is that
    counsel’s unavailability on that offered date occurred after the matter had
    not proceeded on the originally scheduled trial date of February 20, 2006,
    nor on the second scheduled date of September 15, 2006.   As I will explain
    later, within my analysis as to the reasons for the delays, I attribute the
    responsibility for the case not proceeding on both dates to the Crown.  In
    my opinion defence counsel can reasonably expect that matters will proceed
    when scheduled, and fill his or her subsequent calendar with other matters
    accordingly.  To hold that the delay clock stops as soon as a single available
    date is offered to the defence and not accepted, in circumstances where the
    Crown is responsible for the case having to be re-scheduled, is not reasonable.  Defence
    counsel cannot hold the balance of their schedule without commitments so
    as to be in a position to agree to a single make up day offered by the court
    and agreeable to the prosecution.  If defence counsel could be reasonably
    expected to do so, it seems to be equally reasonable to require both the
    court and the Crown to also maintain “backup” available days so as to facilitate
    early replacement of a cancelled trial date. Indeed, it was so held in <i>R.
    v. Maracle</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.). See also <i>R. v. Satkunananthan</i>,

    appears from the record that in the jurisdiction from which this case arises,
    many of these discussions are held in scheduling sessions with the trial
    coordinator.  A full account of the dates offered and who was available or
    unavailable on each of them is not before us, either in the form of a transcript,

      agreement to a future date will usually give rise to an inference of waiver,
      where the new date is a replacement date resulting from a Crown adjournment,
      expressions of concern about the delay by defence counsel can rebut the
      inference of waiver.  In my opinion defence counsel in this case expressed
      concern about delay on at least two occasions to which I will refer later.</p>

    trial did not proceed as originally scheduled on February 20, 2006.  Approximately
    four days earlier the Crown had received a verbal report indicating that
    tests by the Centre of Forensic Sciences (CFS) determined that sperm found
    in a vaginal swab from the complainant was not that of the accused.  The
    CFS also provided information as to the length of time prior to the taking
    of the vaginal swab that the sperm could have been deposited.  Apparently
    two differing opinions were provided by the CFS to the Crown, one estimating
    six to twelve hours and the other estimating twelve to twenty-four hours.  The
    record is not very clear as to when each of those opinions were received.  Before
    the trial judge on the February 20, 2006 trial date defence counsel indicated
    that he had been alerted to these developments in the few prior days, but
    had just received copies of the reports that morning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel before Gordon J. submitted that this information was of critical
    importance to the defence, particularly given the complainant’s admission
    to the worker gathering the sexual assault kit at the hospital, that she
    had not had sexual intercourse for three days before the alleged attack.  As
    Crown counsel indicated before Gordon J, the new information raised a “glaring
    inconsistency”
    in the complainant’s evidence, and hence the Crown case.  This is a case
    in which credibility was the prime issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    adjournment of the trial took place as a result of last minute disclosure.  I
    do not suggest personal fault on the part of the Crown, who disclosed the
    new information promptly.  The delay in making this disclosure arose from
    the fact that the CFS only disclosed the information to the Crown on the
    eve of trial, no doubt having just finished the testing at that time.</p>

    my opinion within the s.11(b) analysis, the Crown has to bear the responsibility
    for the adjournment of a trial because of late disclosure, when that late
    disclosure comes from the CFS.  This court so held in <i>R. v. Seegmiller</i> (2004),
    191 C.C.C. (3d) 347 at paragraphs 6 and 15, leave to appeal dismissed [2005]

    case was next scheduled for September 15, 2006 for a preliminary inquiry.  When
    that date was set on February 24, 2006, defence counsel confirmed that he
    was available that date but advised the presiding judge that he would be
    writing a letter to the court and to the Crown advising them of his earlier
    available dates because
    “obviously, its quite a ways down the road.”  He wrote that letter and offered
    31 earlier available dates.  He received no reply from either the court or
    the Crown.</p>

    do not know the nature or urgency of the other matters called in priority
    to this one.  It’s fair to assume that the Crown that day had good reasons
    for proceeding as he or she did, but this was a case that had already missed
    one trial date, and was clearly in trouble in terms of the appellant’s s.11(b)
    rights.  In my opinion, greater effort ought to have been made to either
    clear that docket of other cases so as to permit this one to proceed, or
    an additional court ought to have been set up for this case.  If there were
    insufficient resources available to permit that to be done, that is to be
    attributed to the Crown for purposes of the s. 11(b) analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. R.M</i>. (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 49, this court held at paragraph 9
      that when a case is already identified as being in trouble from the delay
      perspective, there is an obligation on the court and on counsel to take
      steps to remedy this situation. This view was reaffirmed in <i>R. v. N.N.M.</i>,
      [2006] O.J. No.1802 (C.A.). Here, as a result of the case being unable
      to proceed on the original trial date owing to the late Crown disclosure,
      there was an obligation on the court and on the defence to make special
      effort to expedite the delayed hearing of this matter.  Defence counsel
      made his efforts when he wrote in February, 2006 offering earlier dates.  There
      is nothing in the record to indicate that the court or the Crown did anything
      to facilitate an early replacement date.  Rather than facilitating an earlier
      date to replace the original adjourned trial date, the Crown brought about
      an adjournment of the replacement date by choosing to proceed with other
      matters in priority to this one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, in my opinion, the Crown bears responsibility for the delay
    from February 2006 to the eventual committal in February 2007.  Furthermore,
    within that period of delay, the defence signified concern about the delay,
    and made efforts to try and shorten the period of delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    when the matter did not proceed on September 15, 2006, Crown counsel indicated
    to the court that there was some urgency to the matter and that it was hoped
    that the trial coordinator would find them an earlier date than the February
    2007 eventual preliminary hearing date.  Defence counsel indicated that he
    had given a list of all his available dates, which in my opinion, is again
    indicative of a concern about delay on the part of the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the Crown is responsible for the 11 ½
    month period of delay.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    was held in <i>Morin</i>, some measure of prejudice is usually properly inferred
    simply by reason of the delay, occasioning as it does a longer period of
    bail restriction, and the anxiety which follows delays and postponements
    of the day of adjudication.  I agree that elements of inferred prejudice
    were not overly weighty in this case, but they are present. Bail restrictions,
    even if classified as minimal, have been held to demonstrate prejudice: <i>R.
    v. Williams</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 1400 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 242. Apart from inferred prejudice,
    the defence may tender evidence of actual prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, the appellant demonstrated the existence of actual prejudice
    in support of the application for a stay of proceedings.  This was a credibility
    case.  The DNA testing showed the sperm found in the vaginal swab was not
    that of the appellant.  In answering questions during the compilation of
    the sexual assault kit, the complainant indicated that she had not had sexual
    intercourse for three days priors to the alleged assault.  When challenged
    on this at the preliminary inquiry she claimed alternatively that she could
    not remember, or that perhaps she didn’t understand the question that had
    been asked by the sexual assault worker, or as she stated “I don’t know”.  Both
    she and her new boyfriend testified that they had not had sexual intercourse
    between the time of the alleged assault and the collection of the sexual
    assault kit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the preliminary inquiry the complainant’s boyfriend testified under oath
    that he had offered to provide a DNA sample to someone, but could not remember
    who.  Common sense indicates that it was not the defence.   His offer was
    apparently not pursued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    a crucial issue at trial would be whether the sperm found in the sample was
    that of the boyfriend, despite her denials to the sexual assault worker,
    and her sworn inability to remember at the preliminary inquiry, or, whether
    it was that of someone else.  That latter possibility would be highly damaging
    to the complainant’s credibility, and to the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the proceedings before Gordon J. trial defence counsel argued that the delay
    had occasioned actual prejudice in that the passage of time had improved
    the plausibility of the complainant’s explanation that she could no longer
    remember, and of her suggestion that maybe she didn’t understand what she
    was being asked by the sexual assault worker.  As juries are often instructed,
    the passage of time between the event and the testimony concerning it often
    makes an inability to remember more understandable.  The interrelationship
    between delay and potential prejudice resulting from fading memories, and
    thus adversely affecting trial fairness, particularly in sexual assault cases,
    has been recognized in <i>R. v. Igbinosun</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 5190 (S.C.J.)
    at paragraph 59.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the reasons granting the stay of proceedings, the trial judge does not advert
    to this defence contention of actual prejudice.  In my opinion, it was an
    error to fail or neglect to do so.  The transcript of the hearing before
    the trial judge clearly demonstrates that the issue was clearly advanced
    before him, although not responded to by trial Crown counsel. In<i> R. v.
    Sheppard</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298, the Supreme Court of Canada gave
    directions concerning the need for reasons. While reasons are clearly not
    mandatory in respect of every aspect of a case, in my respectful opinion,
    reasons were required  in respect of  a defence submission clearly calling
    into play a mandated issue requiring examination in a s.11(b) analysis.  In
    the context of this appeal, the failure to do so is immaterial to the outcome
    of the appeal in that the reasons would have either accepted the argument
    and thereby added further support to the finding of a s.11(b) breach, or
    would have rejected the submission and been neutral in the result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    other members of the panel classify the nature of the actual prejudice claim
    to be speculative, I do not agree.  To some extent any such claim is speculative
    in that one cannot know for certainty the outcome of the trial, and hence
    the effect of the prejudice on trial fairness.  Of course, if the outcome
    of the trial is unfavourable, one cannot apply for a stay at that stage of
    the proceedings or on appeal, (<i>R. v. Rabba</i> (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d)
    445 (Ont. C.A.)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paragraphs 41 and 42, the majority conclude that the trial judge erred by
    stating that the accused had not received a trial within a reasonable time
    before he began his analysis of prejudice.  In my opinion a fair reading
    of the paragraph suggests that he misspoke rather than erring by failing
    to deal with prejudice prior to stating the result as he did. The fact is
    that he did go on to examine the prejudice issue, which would have been unnecessary
    had he erroneously concluded that it was immaterial to the s. 11(b) analysis.  Read
    as a whole, I conclude that he clearly understood that prejudice is a necessary
    part of the required examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the issue of prejudice is a necessary element to the legal analysis of the
    s. 11(b) issue, on a broader approach the trial judge’s comment is a fair
    and accurate one.  Delay is prejudicial to many values and interests which
    underpin the <i>Charter</i> protections.  In a real sense it is appropriate
    to say that prejudice results from delay.  Indeed, I suggest recognition
    of that fact resulted in the inclusion of s. 11(b) to protect against it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    burden of proof on an applicant seeking <i>Charter</i> relief is to show
    a violation of a <i>Charter</i> right on a balance of probabilities.  As
    an element of the s.11(b) analysis, prejudice need not be shown beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  In my assessment, the extra passage of time made it more
    likely than not that the appellant’s ability to effectively cross-examine
    the complainant and her boyfriend on the important DNA issue had been diminished. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not unmindful of society’s high interest in having matters tried on their
    merits.  An equally high priority for society is to see that trials are conducted
    fairly.  Where trial fairness is compromised by delays occasioned by events
    for which the Crown is responsible, then a remedy must be granted.  The societal
    interest in having matters proceed to trial is heightened in the case of
    more serious charges, but equally important is everyone’s interest that such
    trials be fair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the period of delay under consideration of just under a year in itself exceeds
    the guidelines suggested in <i>Morin, </i>and it occurs after the suggested
    guideline period had already been expended getting the case that far.  Longer
    periods of delay are tolerable in complex and lengthy cases.  This was neither.  It
    was a credibility case of few days expected duration.  Only one day was required
    for the preliminary. That would make easier the prompt finding of a replacement
    date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the majority opines that the conversion of this matter from a trial to a
    preliminary was of some advantage to the appellant, I observe that it also
    substantially enlarged the available penalty range to which the appellant
    became exposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion the delay of just under one year between the original trial date
    and the eventual committal date, which delay was the result of two developments
    for which the Crown is responsible, and which delay in my assessment, was
    likely to have impacted negatively on the appellant’s ability to make full
    answer and defence in a fair trial, could and should lead to a conclusion
    that the appellant’s s. 11(b) right was infringed or denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conclusion of the trial judge was supportable on the facts and did not result
    from any material error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my assessment we should not interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of
    the discretion entrusted to him under s. 24 (1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
