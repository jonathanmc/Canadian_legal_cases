  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    judge erred in failing to conclude that the first of three statements given
    by the appellant to the police was obtained in violation of his section 10(b)
    right to counsel, and ought to have been excluded under section 24(2);</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>that the trial judge
    erred in instructing the jury that if they found that the appellant had the
    required intent for murder, and that if they rejected provocation, the appropriate
    verdict was one of first degree murder, in circumstances where the appropriate
    direction would have been that those findings would substantiate a finding
    of murder, with planning and deliberation being the additional element required
    for first degree murder. The appellant contends that the trial judge’s correcting
    instruction was insufficient;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    the intent required for murder;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was 21 years of age.  When he was two, the victim married his father.  His
    father died unexpectedly in 1999.  The victim was angry that she had not
    been left adequate insurance and spoke ill of the appellant’s father.  There
    was evidence that thereafter the appellant became increasingly angry with
    his step-mother.  Her disrespect upset the appellant, as did the fact that
    she gave away some of his father’s belongings, and she had a new boyfriend
    move in with her in what the appellant thought to be an unseemly short period
    of time following his father’s death.  He also admitted being upset by remarks
    the victim made when she spoke of selling the family home and moving to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and his girlfriend, Sandy Viveiros, lived in an apartment near
    the victim’s home and would frequently visit her.  In the period prior to
    the killing the appellant and Viveiros frequently stayed over at her home.  In
    this period the victim became increasingly depressed and she abused alcohol
    and sleeping pills.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the months prior to the killing the appellant had spoken to Viveiros about
    wanting to kill his step-mother, although the evidence was inconsistent as
    to whether he was serious.  On one occasion the victim left a suicide note
    and the appellant kept it and indicated that it might be of use later.  There
    was evidence that on one occasion the appellant deliberately caused the victim
    to ingest an overdose of sleeping pills.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the evening leading up to the killing, the appellant told Viveiros that this
    was the day he was going to do “it”.  He consumed alcohol and marijuana.  He
    left his step-mother’s home and went to his own apartment.  He phoned his
    step-mother from a phone booth and asked her to meet him in the parking lot
    where her body was subsequently found.  He borrowed a bicycle from a friend
    which he used to get to that parking lot, and to leave from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and Viveiros arranged to have a friend, Stacey, come over to the
    victim’s home so as to unwittingly be available as an alibi.  Viveiros was
    to show Stacey the bed with the covers rumpled in such a way as to suggest
    that the appellant was asleep in the bed, when in fact he was out confronting
    his mother.  This was done with the appellant’s prior knowledge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant left the victim’s home carrying a duffle bag.  Viveiros testified
    that he told her it contained a change of clothing.  The appellant testified
    he could not remember what the bag contained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant rode the borrowed bicycle to the parking lot of the community centre
    at which he had requested the victim to attend.  He had with him a six inch
    kitchen knife.  As she sat in the driver’s seat he inflicted thirty knife
    wounds, eighteen of which were to her chest, and the balance were in the
    nature of defensive wounds to the hands and arms of the victim.  Of the eighteen
    wounds to the chest, seven were superficial and of a slashing nature, but
    the other eleven penetrated the chest and vital organs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Linda
    Kozar lived near the parking lot.  She observed a man run out of the parking
    lot towards her and to ride away on the bicycle.  Her description of the
    man was generally consistent with the appellant in terms of age and racial
    background, but differed from him in terms of the amount of facial hair and
    clothing.  It was the same witness who early the next morning discovered
    the victim’s body in the parking lot and alerted police.  Later that same
    morning she was shown a photographic line-up and failed to pick out the appellant’s
    picture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the killing, the appellant threw the knife in a nearby field and rode the
    bicycle to his step-mother’s home. He hid his shoes in a hedge behind her
    house, and put the bicycle behind other items in the garage. When found,
    the tires of the bicycle were deflated.  Viveiros and Stacey were in the
    home. The appellant entered the home by sneaking in through a bedroom window.
    He called Viveiros into the bedroom and reported that
    “it” was done.  He showered.  He hid the clothing he had been wearing in
    the bedroom and in the garage. Bloodstains on the clothing matched the DNA
    of the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early morning hours after the killing, initially Viveiros, and subsequently
    the appellant, each telephoned the police to report the victim as missing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified at trial.  He admitted that he felt angry towards the
    victim because of things she said and did, which he felt did not show proper
    respect towards his father.  He admitted being upset by the fact that she
    had another man move into his father’s home.  The appellant admitted that
    on occasion he talked to Viveiros about killing his step-mother, but at trial
    claimed it was just a way of venting his anger.  At trial he admitted he
    planned to have Stacey visit so as to be able to confirm his presence in
    the house, while in fact he would be out confronting his step-mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s evidence was that during the meeting in the victim’s car in the
    parking lot, they discussed various feelings each had arising out of his
    father’s death.  He testified he felt he was sober enough to talk to her
    about these matters.  While the last topic he could remember being discussed
    was her intention to sell the house and move to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Greece</st1:country-region>
    , he testified at trial that he didn’t really take that seriously.  His evidence
    is that he called her a greedy bitch, and she told him to get out of her
    life and that he could rot in hell with his father.  As a result, he snapped,
    or lost it, took out the knife and stabbed her.  In chief, he testified he
    remembered stabbing his step-mother, but thought it was only four or five
    times, that he was mad and lost control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    cross-examination, he admitted telling the police that he had planned this
    in his head.  When questioned as to what he meant by “planned”, he said that
    at the time he snapped his intentions were to kill his step-mother.  When
    asked why he called the victim to ask her to meet him in the parking lot,
    rather than confronting her either in her home, or in his apartment, he said
    that had never occurred to him.  He agreed that it was arranged that Stacey
    would be there so she could say he had been in bed the whole time, so that
    no one would know that he had been with the victim. He agreed that he had
    known beforehand that his step-mother had talked about selling the house
    and accordingly that was not a surprise to him that night. He admitted in
    cross-examination that he was angry just before he stabbed her, that he was
    aware he had the knife, he was aware of the victim’s identity, he was aware
    that she was screaming as he stabbed her and that she was trying to defend
    herself.  He agreed and accepted that he had told the police that as soon
    as he had stabbed her the first time he knew that he had to continue.  He
    admitted that while stabbing her he turned his mind to whether it was murder
    or attempted murder and decided that it was the same thing so he decided
    to keep going.  He agreed that in the midst of stabbing her he was able to
    contemplate the consequences, and the potential penalties, and decided they
    would be the same.  He agreed that he was not flailing around with the knife
    but rather hitting his target each time.  He admitted he thought to throw
    away the knife immediately after stabbing her, that he was able to ride home
    on the bicycle, that he had sufficient awareness to climb through the window
    to gain access to the home without being seen by Viveiros and Stacey, and
    that he hid his shoes and clothing.  He admitted that in response to comments
    by the victim in the car to the effect that he was drunk, that he told her “Yeah,
    I know I’m drunk but I know exactly what I’m doing”, and he admitted that
    is what he believed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant challenges the trial judge’s pre-trial ruling denying an application
    to exclude the appellant’s first statement to the police on May 23, 2001
    on the basis that it was obtained in violation of his section 10(b) right
    to counsel.  Voluntariness was not at issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    victim’s body had been discovered earlier that morning.  The police knew
    the vehicle was registered to the victim and knew her home address.  By that
    stage her purse containing her identification had not yet been found in the
    field where the appellant had thrown it.  The police also knew that the witness,
    Linda Kozar, had reported the sighting of the man on the bicycle in the area
    and had given a description which in terms of general appearance resembled
    the accused.  Both Viveiros and the appellant had telephoned the police to
    report the victim missing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only evidence on the application was that of two police officers.  The evidence
    was that police records disclosed the appellant also lived at the victim’s
    address, and provided a physical description of the appellant which in general
    terms matched the description given by Kozar. Detective Chantler had caused
    the victim’s residence to be placed under surveillance and the appellant
    and Viveiros had been observed. The appellant was noted to match the general
    physical description given by Kozar. Chantler directed other officers to
    maintain surveillance on the appellant, but gave directions that he was not
    to be approached unless he appeared to be leaving the area, in which case
    Chantler would attend and advise him that the body was believed to be that
    of his step-mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    5:52 a.m. detectives arrived at the victim’s home and found the appellant
    and Viveiros sitting on the front porch. Police advised the appellant that
    the body discovered earlier was believed to be that of his step-mother.  The
    appellant and Viveiros were asked to attend at the police station for a video
    taped interview.  The police evidence was that such interviews were standard
    practice and designed to obtain background information about the victim and
    her whereabouts in the days preceding the death.  The appellant and Viveiros
    agreed to the interview.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viveiros
    was interviewed first and gave an alibi that the appellant had been at home
    all night and provided the name of Stacey, the other alibi witness.  During
    her interview the police also had been advised that the witness Kozar had
    failed to identify the appellant in the photographic line up shown to her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span

    8:14 a.m. Detective Hettinga began to interview the appellant, under the
    direction of Detective Chantler.  The two had discussed and agreed they did
    not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant.  They classified
    him as being a person of interest.  They agreed that if anything was said
    by the appellant during the interview to change that status, the interview
    would be stopped and the appellant would be arrested and advised of his rights
    to counsel.  Initially the appellant denied having seen his step-mother at
    the relevant time.  Hettinga did advise him that a witness had “picked him
    out” of a line up, which was false. The officer explained that he did this
    so as to see if that would cause the appellant to change his story.   The
    officer also asked the appellant if he would agree to provide a DNA sample,
    and testified that such requests are standard in cases of this nature. The
    appellant agreed, and also consented to a search of the house.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant made exculpatory comments during the interview.  After approximately
    45 minutes he admitted that he had been at the community centre, and had
    spoken to his step-mother, but had left her alive.  Upon that admission being
    made, the interview was terminated and he was arrested and given his rights
    to counsel and arrangements were made for him to speak to counsel by telephone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    officers testified that the appellant had been free to leave the police station
    at any time up to the point that he was arrested, and the police testified
    they had made no demands or given any directions inhibiting the freedom of
    the appellant.</p>

    was no evidence that the appellant felt that he had been “psychologically”
    detained.  He did not testify on the application. There was no evidence of
    acquiescence in a demand or direction, which is essential to constitute psychological
    detention: <i>R. v. Bazinet</i> (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont.

    this first interview, and that accordingly his section 10(b) rights had not
    been engaged.  There was ample evidence to support this conclusion.  The
    fact that the physical description given by Kozar only generally matched
    the appellant, the fact that she had subsequently failed to pick his photograph
    out of a line up, and the alibi evidence given by Viveiros on behalf of the
    appellant strongly support the trial judge’s finding that the police did
    not have reasonable and probable grounds to charge or arrest the appellant
    prior to the interview.  There was ample evidence upon which the trial judge
    could conclude that the questioning was part of a general investigation,
    as opposed to police questioning for the purpose of obtaining incriminating
    statements from a person the police had decided to be responsible for the
    crime, as delineated in <i>R. v. Moran</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.

    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct the

    Crown’s case did not rely upon her evidence to prove that the appellant was
    the killer.  His own evidence proved that.  Linda Kozar’s evidence was of
    some relevance in that she described the man who approached her from the
    direction of the community centre as “whooping like an Indian”, suggesting
    to her that the sound was of a celebratory nature.  That evidence would be
    relevant to the issue of the alleged lack of intent by reason of intoxication,
    and possibly of some relevance to the issue of planning.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the morning of the killing, Kozar had provided the police with a description
    of the man which matched the appellant’s general appearance, but was inaccurate
    as to clothing.  When shown a photographic line-up, Kozar had failed to pick
    out his photograph.  When she testified in chief at trial, she said “he looks
    just like the gentleman sitting behind you…but he had a lot more facial hair
    then and he wore greens, hospital greens, and he had a toque on but…what
    kind of jacket or that, I don’t recall”.</p>

    the pre-charge conference, defence counsel specifically asked for the traditional
    charge regarding the frailties of eye witness identification.  Defence counsel
    detailed Kozar’s evidence and the frailties of identification evidence in
    his address to the jury.  In her address, crown counsel submitted to the
    jury that it was up to them to decide whether or not to accept Kozar’s evidence
    that she believes the appellant was the man she saw that night.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the charge to the jury, the trial judge pointed out the discrepancies in
    her description to the police as compared to a photograph of the appellant,
    the fact that she had failed to pick the appellant out of the photographic
    line-up, and recited the qualified nature of her identification in court.  He
    reviewed the evidence as to her description of the bicycle accurately.  He
    did not charge the jury as to the usual frailties of identification evidence.  Rather
    he left her evidence to the jury as circumstantial evidence.</p>

    charge.  Crown counsel at trial suggested the charge as given was sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge declined to re-charge the jury on that issue, expressing his
    view that to do so would call attention to her evidence which he thought
    to be prejudicial to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the trial judge fairly reviewed the relevant evidence for the
    jury, and properly raised with them the need to consider whether by coincidence
    there could have been another man in that particular location with similar
    features and riding a similar bicycle.  The jury had the appellant’s testimony
    that he had killed the victim at that location and then left on a bicycle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    probative value of her evidence lay not in identification in the usual sense,
    but rather in her description of the celebratory whooping of the man she
    saw, and in her description of his physical dexterity which undermined the
    defence of lack of intent or planning and deliberation based on drug or alcohol
    intoxication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, it would have been preferable had the trial judge charged the
    jury in the traditional way.  Instead he chose to put her evidence to the
    jury as in effect falling short of identifying the appellant, but amounting
    to circumstantial evidence as to the identity of the man she observed. He
    invited the jury to consider whether it was prepared to draw the inference
    that the man she described was one and the same as the appellant, to which
    he coupled the warning that the appellant was to be given the benefit of
    any reasonable doubt.</p>

    the limited purpose for which this evidence was offered, which did not involve
    reliance upon it to prove the identity of the perpetrator, in my view the
    jury was adequately instructed with respect to the discrepancies in her description
    of the man and the bicycle. The jury was advised to determine whether the
    man was indeed the appellant, or whether there was a reasonable possibility
    that the witness saw a similar man on a similar bicycle at that same location
    and at the same time. The jury was instructed to give the benefit of any
    reasonable doubt on the issue to the appellant. <i></i></p>

    that the correct factual discrepancies were pointed out, in my opinion the

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Instructions on the Use

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant objects to the instructions on the use that could be made on post-offence
    conduct in a case like this where the appellant has admitted responsibility
    for the killing.  Counsel contends that a “no probative value”
    instruction ought to have been given on the issue of whether the killing
    amounted to manslaughter as opposed to murder, in accordance with the directions
    in <i>R. v. Arcangioli </i>(1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    post-offence conduct here consisted of the creation and use of the alibi,
    the changing and then hiding of the clothes, the flattening of the tires
    on the bicycle and advising the police of the missing person.  I point out
    that the real significance of the alibi evidence was that it was arranged <i>before </i>the
    killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    was held in <i>R. v. MacKinnon </i>(1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.)
    at 547, post-offence conduct depending on the circumstances of the case can
    be relevant to the issue of the intent required for murder, and can be relevant
    to the issue of planning and deliberation.  In my opinion, this evidence
    was relevant to those issues in the circumstances of this case.  The actions
    of the appellant shortly after the killing were relevant to the issue of
    intoxication, and hence to the issue of the intent required for murder. The
    putting into play of an alibi arranged before the murder was relevant to
    the issue of planning and deliberation.  Defence counsel at trial conceded
    in pre-charge conference submissions that the evidence was relevant to the
    issue of planning and deliberation.  The Crown’s address to the jury did
    not invite any improper usage of the post-offence conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his closing address to the jury, defence counsel referred to some of the
    same evidence as being inconsistent with either an intentional or planned
    and deliberate murder, arguing that better efforts to dispose of the incriminating
    evidence would have been undertaken if the murder was intentional and planned
    and deliberate.  It would have been an error to charge the jury that they
    were not entitled to consider the alternate use to which the evidence could
    be put.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated in <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), after the fact conduct can be relevant to prove that an accused had the
    required intent for murder despite evidence of intoxication.  In my opinion
    such evidence was admissible for this purpose in this case.  The action of
    the appellant very shortly after the killing was capable of demonstrating
    both physical dexterity and mental awareness that would be inconsistent with
    intoxication to the point of preventing the formation of the intent required
    for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    post-offence conduct is determined to be admissible on the issue of planning
    and deliberation, in the vast majority of cases it is artificial to say that
    it is inadmissible on the issue of intent required for murder, in that most
    planned and deliberate homicides will not involve unintended killings. It
    is further submitted that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to
    consider all the evidence “before, at the time, and after” the killing.  In
    the circumstances of this case, at least, there was no error in that instruction.</p>

    his charge to the jury on the issue of intent and intoxication, the trial
    judge charged the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant had the required state of mind for murder, they were obligated
    to find him guilty of first degree murder.  Similarly, when dealing with
    the issue of intoxication, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they
    rejected intoxication they should find the appellant guilty of first degree
    murder.  Further, in instructing the jury with respect to provocation, he
    instructed the jury to find the appellant guilty of first degree murder if
    they rejected provocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is obvious that those instructions were in error. Jury conclusions adverse
    to the appellant on the issues of the intent required for murder, intoxication
    as affecting that issue, and provocation would all lead to a finding of guilt
    for murder, as opposed to first degree murder.  Such findings by the jury
    would then properly be followed by a consideration of the issue of planning
    and deliberation as the additional step required to elevate the crime to
    one of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Immediately
    after giving the jury these instructions, the court took a normally scheduled
    morning recess.  As soon as the jury retired, defence counsel brought the
    error to the trial judge’s attention. Upon resuming after the 15 minute recess
    the trial judge immediately instructed the jury that he had been in error
    in his earlier instructions, and charged them that if  they resolved those
    three issues in favour of the Crown, the result would be a finding of second
    degree murder, rather than first degree murder.  He instructed the jury that
    he had not yet dealt with the issue of planning and deliberation, which is
    the extra ingredient required to be proven for first degree murder.</p>

    trial judge correctly instructed the jury both at the outset of the jury
    charge, at its conclusion, and during the charge on planning and deliberation,
    that this latter element was required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
    before the jury could return a verdict of first degree murder. The jury’s
    return of that verdict demonstrates that they were so satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am of the view that the correcting charge was sufficient to accurately clarify
    the jury’s understanding as to the necessary elements for the various offences
    relevant to their deliberations.  Read as a whole, the charge made it clear
    to the jury that proof of planning and deliberation beyond a reasonable doubt
    was an essential element for first degree murder, and that the jury could
    not have been left in confusion on that issue.  I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a sub-issue relating to the instructions as to the intent required for

    dealing with the issue of the intent required for murder, the trial judge

    of the two types of intent set forth in section 229(a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    three subsequent references to the intent required for murder under section
    229(a) (ii) his instruction to the jury was incomplete in that it omitted
    the element “that he knows is likely to cause death”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    six subsequent passages the trial judge referred to “the required intent” or “the
    intent for murder” or “either of the intents for murder” without repeating
    the definition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first three occasions where the trial judge purported to give the section
    229(a) (ii) instruction but omitted the element that “he knows is likely
    to cause death” constituted an error.  The later references to the intent
    required for murder, or the “required intent” are in my opinion of little
    concern.  While it would have been preferable to fully instruct the jury
    as to all elements of both types of intent necessary for murder and then
    to expressly advise the jury “that hereafter my references to the intent
    required for murder would be to either or both of the required intents for
    murder as I have defined them for you”, in my opinion that is not an absolute
    requirement.  The omission of the phrase “that he knows is likely to cause
    death” is of potential concern in that it constitutes one of the elements
    required for the second type of intent permitted under section 229(a).</p>

    were no objections at trial to that portion of the charge.  In the circumstances
    of this case I am of the view that the error would have no practical effect.  Given
    the number of stab wounds, the multiple stab wounds to the chest of the victim,
    and the admission during the appellant’s testimony that while stabbing his
    step-mother he turned his mind to the issue of attempted murder as compared
    to murder, and to the penalties for each, and decided to keep going, in my
    opinion the only reasonable conclusion for the jury to reach, once they had
    rejected intoxication and provocation, was that the appellant intended to
    kill as contemplated in section 229(a)(i).</p>

    case provocation and intoxication would not be the proper subject of a rolled-up
    charge.  Intoxication is relevant to the issue of whether the appellant had
    the required intent. Provocation by definition presupposes the required intent

    of intent, but also to the issue of provocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also agree with the Crown’s submission that the appellant likely received
    an undeserved bonus by having the issue of provocation left with the jury
    at all. The subject matter of the discussions between him and the deceased
    did not involve any factors that were new.  They had been discussed previously.  While
    there may have been some new expressions in terms of name calling, in his
    testimony the appellant admitted making a conscious decision to keep stabbing
    the victim because on his analysis there was no difference between murder
    and attempted murder.  That admission of conscious deliberation is inconsistent
    with provocation. The verbal confrontation between him and his step-mother
    was also something the appellant had arranged to take place, and on his own
    evidence her hurtful comments were in response to his calling her a greedy
    or selfish bitch.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to give a full instruction
    pursuant to the decision in <i>R v. W. (D.) </i>(1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397
    (S.C.C.) at page 409.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the jury charge, in the sections relating to intention, intoxication, and
    to planning and deliberation, the trial judge instructed the jury with respect
    to the first two branches of the <i>W.D.</i> formulation dealing with the
    acceptance of the appellant’s evidence, or rejection of it, but being left
    with a reasonable doubt by it. At no point did the trial judge give the third
    step of the <i>W.D.</i> formulation, namely that even if the evidence of
    the appellant is totally rejected, they must still go on to consider on the
    balance of the evidence whether the Crown has met the burden of proof.  This
    was an incomplete instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the other hand, in numerous instances throughout the charge, the trial judge
    instructed the jury to consider all of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Failure
    to give a full instruction in this regard was the subject of an objection
    to the charge by defence counsel.  The trial judge declined to recall the
    jury to further charge on that issue, initially reasoning that he thought
    he had dealt with it clearly enough, and thereafter declining to do so on
    the basis that a verdict of not guilty was unavailable to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no point in the charge was there a suggestion that rejection or disbelief
    of the appellant’s evidence constituted proof of the opposite.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    appellate court must take a functional approach when assessing the adequacy
    of jury instructions, and determine whether they fulfilled the purpose for
    which they were given. While in my opinion, the charge was in error in failing
    to give a complete <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction, I conclude that the error could
    not have reasonably had any effect on the outcome in this matter.  It was
    only the evidence of the appellant that theoretically called into question
    the issue of planning and deliberation, and only his evidence that arguably,
    at best, amounted to a denial of the intent necessary for murder.  If his
    evidence was rejected, on the balance of the evidence the outcome was clear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly,
    the Crown submits that if we should find there to be merit in any of the
    grounds of appeal, the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed by application
    of s.686 (1) (b)(iii).  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case,
    none of the deficiencies identified in the charge to the jury constitute
    a reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    if I had come to a different conclusion with respect to any of the deficiencies
    in the charge, even if viewed cumulatively, in my opinion the evidence led
    was so overwhelming that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
    justice.  The admissions by the appellant to the police in the unchallenged
    statements, his admissions in testimony before the jury particularly as to
    his thoughts during the killing, together with the unchallengeable evidence
    of a pre-planned alibi, constitute an unanswerable case of first degree murder.</p>

    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
