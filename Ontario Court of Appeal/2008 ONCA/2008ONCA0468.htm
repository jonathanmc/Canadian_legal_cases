    appellant plaintiffs were injured in a bus collision that occurred on December&nbsp;23,
    2000.  The plaintiffs alleged that the collision was caused by the defendant,
    Shaun Davis, who seized the steering wheel of the bus while it was moving,
    causing it to crash.  The plaintiffs commenced separate actions against Davis,
    Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp., Her Majesty the Queen in Right of
    Ontario (the “Crown”), and others in June 2001.   </p>

    to the expiry of the two-year limitation period then prescribed by s. 206
    of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, the defendant Crown
    added the respondent, Dr. James, as a third party to the action.  The Crown
    alleged that Dr. James was negligent in failing to provide proper medical
    care for
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Davis and in failing to advise him of the proper dosage and side effects
    of certain medication prescribed to him, which the Crown alleged caused or
    contributed to his actions causing the accident.  All actions, including
    the third party claims, were ordered consolidated in December 2004.</p>

    relevant limitation period expired on December 23, 2002.  In October 2006,
    the plaintiffs sought to add Dr. James as a party defendant to the action.  Dr.
    James opposed the motion on two grounds: (1) that s. 21(1) of the new Act<i> </i>applied
    and its effect was to preclude the addition of a claim against a new party
    to an existing action after the expiry of the limitation period; and (2)
    that if s. 21(1) did not apply or did not have that effect, there were no
    special circumstances that would warrant adding Dr. James as a defendant,
    even though she was already a party to the action as a third party.</p>

    motion judge decided the motion on both grounds. He found that s 21(1) of
    the new Act applied and that it precluded the addition of Dr. James as a
    defendant.  Section 21(1) states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal'>21(1) If a limitation

    events that gave rise to the claims in this case occurred in December 2000.
    The plaintiffs commenced an action against a number of defendants within
    the applicable two-year limitation period under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.
    On January 1, 2004, the new Act<i> </i>came into effect. The plaintiffs brought
    their motion to add Dr. James as a defendant in October 2006. Because the
    relevant events occurred before January 1, 2004 but the motion was brought
    after, the court must determine which provisions of the new Act apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    new Act<i> </i>contains transition provisions in s. 24 that deal with the
    application of the new Act to claims based on acts or omissions that took
    place before the new Act came into effect, but in respect of which no proceeding
    was commenced before January&nbsp;1, 2004.
     Subsections 24(2) and (3) provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal'>24(2)  This
    section applies to claims based on acts or omissions that took place before
    the effective date and in respect of which no proceeding has been commenced
    before the effective date.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal'>24(3)  If the
    former limitation period expired before the effective date, no proceeding
    shall be commenced in respect of the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the relevant events took place long before the new Act came into
    effect and, while the plaintiffs commenced a proceeding before the effective
    date, it was not a proceeding in respect of a claim against Dr. James. In
    order to determine whether s.&nbsp;24 applies, it must first be determined
    what constitutes a “claim” and a “proceeding”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “claim” is defined in s. 1 of the new Act as “a claim to remedy an injury,
    loss or damage that occurred as a result of an act or omission”. This definition
    focuses on particular acts or omissions, even if more than one act or omission
    by more than one party contributed to the same injury.  The term “proceeding” is
    not defined in the new Act.  However, it is defined in rule 1.03(1) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194,<i> </i>as “an action or application”.  Thus,
    the words “claims … in respect of which no proceeding has been commenced” in
    s. 24(2) refer to claims resulting from particular acts or omissions by a
    particular party for which no court action has been commenced. This interpretation
    has been applied in several decisions of the Superior Court of Justice, including <i>Pallotta
    v. Marks</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 2963 (S.C.J.), in which Hoy J. noted at para.&nbsp;23
    that it would be inconsistent with the scheme of the new Act “for ‘proceeding’ in
    section 24(2) to be interpreted without reference to the person against whom
    the proceeding is made”.  Accordingly, although the plaintiffs commenced
    a proceeding within the limitation period against certain defendants in respect
    of their acts or omissions, no proceeding was commenced by the plaintiffs
    in respect of the acts or omissions of Dr. James. Consequently, the transition
    provision, s. 24 of the new Act, applies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge applied s. 21(1) of the new Act. However, that section only
    applies to claims based on acts or omissions that occurred after January
    1, 2004, the effective date of the new Act.  It does not apply to claims
    governed by the transition provisions in s. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    24(3) is the relevant section in this case.  It states that where the former
    limitation period expired before January 1, 2004, “no proceeding shall be
    commenced in respect of the claim.” As discussed above, because a claim relates
    to a specific act or omission of a particular party, this transition section
    has a similar effect to s. 21(1) by precluding the addition of a claim based
    on the act or omission of a new party after the limitation period has expired.
    In this case, the former two-year limitation period under the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act </i>expired before January 1, 2004.  Thus, no proceeding could
    be commenced in respect of the plaintiffs’ claim against Dr. James by virtue
    of s. 24(3).</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Does
      the special circumstances doctrine apply?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next issue is whether the court retains discretion under the transition provision
    of the new Act to extend the former limitation period by applying the common
    law special circumstances doctrine to permit a claim to be brought after
    the expiry of the former limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Joseph</i>,<i> </i>this
    court held that the common law doctrine of special circumstances cannot be
    used to extend the limitation period under the general, non-transition provisions
    of the new Act.  The court concluded at para. 25 that if these provisions:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal'>… were interpreted
    to include the extension of limitation periods generally by the common law
    doctrine of special circumstances under the Rules, the effect would be contrary
    to the purpose of the new Act by removing the certainty of its limitation
    scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    analysis was based on the conclusion that the new Act is intended to provide
    a comprehensive limitations scheme. Section 4 establishes a basic two-year
    limitation period from the date a claim is discovered, “[u]nless this Act
    provides otherwise”. A court is therefore required to find any exceptions
    to that basic limitation period elsewhere in the new Act.  For example, s.
    20 is an exception that provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:normal'>20. This Act
    does not affect the extension, suspension or other variation of a limitation
    period or other time limit by or under another Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Joseph</i>,
    this court held that s. 20, which refers to statutory extension provisions,
    does not extend to common law extension provisions such as the common law
    doctrine of special circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    transition provision provides another such exception by defining how limitations
    are to be treated in transitional circumstances that bridge the former limitations
    regime and the new Act<i>.</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    24(3) is definitive and makes no reference to an extension of the limitation
    period based on special circumstances. However, it refers to the former limitation
    period, not the new one. As noted in <i>Joseph, </i>the former limitation
    period was interpreted and applied in accordance with the common law developed
    in <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 380, and under rule 5.04(2)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to allow the court to add a party
    to an action after the expiry of a limitation period where special circumstances
    existed and where there was no non-compensable prejudice to the defendant:
    see e.g. <i>Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy Ltd. </i>(2001), 56 O.R. (3d)
    768 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that a potential extension was available under the former limitation
    period if special circumstances were found to exist. The court’s discretion
    to extend the period derived from the common law, as interpreted in conjunction
    with rule 5.04(2), rather than from any statutory provision. In this court’s
    recent decision in <i>Iroquois Falls Power Corp. v. Jacobs Canada Inc.</i>,
    2008 ONCA 320, Juriansz J.A. held that where the former limitation period
    preserved by s. 24(3) contained a statutory discretionary extension provision
    that was specifically repealed by s. 25 of the new Act, the repeal of the
    discretionary extension meant that it was not available to be used when applying
    the former limitation period under s. 24. </p>

    can be contrasted with the situation in <i>Guillemette v. Doucette </i>(2007),
    88 O.R. (3d) 90 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), which dealt with the applicability of the limitation provision contained
    in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15. That section
    contained both a 12-month limitation period and a specific discretion for
    the court to extend the period under “special circumstances”. The limitation
    portion of s. 4 was repealed by the general operation of s. 19 of the new
    Act, but the discretion to extend the limitation period was not repealed
    and remained effective under s. 20 of the new Act. The court held that if
    the transition section applied, the unrepealed statutory extension provision
    remained available under s. 24 to extend the former limitation period where
    appropriate.</p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is more similar to <i>Guillemette</i> in that the common law doctrine
    of special circumstances was not repealed by the new Act.  Therefore, it
    continues to form part of the former limitation period. As in <i>Guillemette</i>,
    by incorporating the former limitation period, s. 24(3) includes all aspects
    of that period that were not repealed by the new Act, including the ability
    to extend the limitation period if there are special circumstances for doing
    so.  This interpretation is consistent with Weiler J.A.’s comment in <i>York
    Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Jay-M Holdings Ltd.</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d)
    414 at para. 39 (C.A.), that although the transition provision “may be regarded
    as generous, it is part of the [new] Act’s attempt to ensure that, with respect
    to pre-existing situations, access to justice be preserved”. </p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, such an interpretation is also consistent with the comprehensive
    nature of the new Act. Section 24(3) “provides otherwise” within the meaning
    of s. 4 by making the former limitation period applicable to some claims
    otherwise governed by the new Act. There is no basis to conclude that in
    causing the former limitation period to apply, the legislature did not intend
    to include all aspects of the operation of that period, including extensions
    based on special circumstances. In that way, the transition provision differs
    from the general provisions of the new Act, which do not incorporate the
    former limitation period or the common law extension that was previously
    available.</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the court can continue to apply the common
    law special circumstances doctrine, where appropriate, to extend a former
    limitation period when the transition provision, s. 24 of the new Act, applies.</p>

    motion judge considered whether there were special circumstances in this
    case that would allow him to extend the former limitation period to permit
    the plaintiffs to add a claim against Dr. James to the existing proceeding.
    He concluded that there were no such circumstances in this case. He found
    that the plaintiffs and their counsel made a deliberate decision before the
    expiry of the limitation period not to include Dr. James as a party defendant.
    This was a considered decision based on legal and practical factors. The
    motion judge observed that the plaintiffs and their counsel had changed their
    minds about suing Dr. James, but had not explained the reason for the change.  He
    concluded that such a change of mind does not amount to special circumstances,
    even if there was no non-compensable prejudice to Dr. James.</p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis to interfere with the motion judge’s decision that there are
    no special circumstances in this case warranting an extension of the limitation
    period. As that decision is discretionary, this court will not interfere
    where the judge considered all the relevant factors and made no error of
    law or of perception of the facts.</p>

    while the motion judge erred in applying s. 21(1) of the new Act, and in
    holding that the transition provision did not apply in this case, his conclusion
    that the proceeding was barred was ultimately correct. Under s. 24(3), <i>prima
    facie</i> no claim could be brought against Dr. James after January 1, 2004.
    The former limitation period could only be extended based on special circumstances.
    The motion judge concluded that there were no special circumstances in this
    case and there is no basis to interfere with that conclusion. </p>
