  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FELDMAN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p>[1]       This case, released concurrently with this court’s decision in <i>Meady
      v. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation</i>, deals with the application
      of the special circumstances doctrine under the new <i>Limitations Act,
      2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B<i> </i>(the “new Act”). </p>
  <p>[2]       Through inadvertence, plaintiff’s counsel failed to issue a statement
    of claim within the limitation period provided under the new Act. On a motion
    to determine as a question of law whether the claim was statute-barred, the
    motion judge applied the common law doctrine of special circumstances, and
    to exercise his discretion to extend the limitation period. The issue raised
    by this appeal is whether that doctrine continues to apply under the new<i> </i>Act.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    facts of this case are relatively simple. The claim arose out of an incident
    in which the plaintiff suffered injuries at the defendant amusement park
    on September 5, 2004. There was no dispute that the new Act applied to this
    claim, and that the claim was discovered the day the injury occurred. As
    a result, the two-year limitation period prescribed by the new Act began
    running on September 5, 2004. The defendant was notified of the claim on
    September 24, 2004, and obtained both a written statement from the plaintiff
    as well as substantial medical documentation concerning the injuries, long
    before the second anniversary of the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    plaintiff’s lawyer used a tickler system to record upcoming limitation periods
    and correctly diarized this action. The lawyer drafted the claim and left
    instructions for his assistant to have the claim issued before September
    5, 2006. The assistant was away on vacation the week of September 4, 2006.
    The lawyer believed the claim had been issued, but the assistant, believing
    the six-year limitation period prescribed by the former <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the “former Act”),<i> </i>continued to apply, did not
    issue the claim before going on vacation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      When
    the lawyer later learned of the error, he forwarded the draft claim to the
    defendant on October 31, 2006 and issued the claim the same day. He advised
    the defendant on November 2, 2006 that, through inadvertence, the claim had
    not been issued until October 31, 2006. A copy of the issued claim was sent
    to the defendant on November 28, 2006 and formally served on January 30,
    2007. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    defendant moved under rule 21.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194,<i> </i>to determine, as a question of law, whether
    the action was statute barred. The motion judge concluded that the action
    was barred by the two-year limitation period provided by s. 4 of the new
    Act. Although this was not a situation where an action had been commenced
    in time and the plaintiff was seeking to add another cause of action or party,
    the motion judge followed a recent line of cases in the Superior Court<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and held that he had a discretion under the doctrine
    of special circumstances to extend the time to commence an action where no
    action had been commenced within the limitation period. The motion judge
    found that special circumstances existed where there was inadvertence on
    the part of the plaintiff’s lawyer and no prejudice to the defendant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    issue raised by this appeal is whether courts continue to have a discretion
    under the new Act to extend a limitation period and allow a claim to be commenced
    after the period has expired by applying the doctrine of special circumstances.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The New Act</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    new Act came into effect on January 1, 2004. It represents a revised, comprehensive
    approach to the limitation of actions. As Weiler J. A. stated in <i>York
    Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Jay-M Holdings Ltd.</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d)
    414 at para. 2 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the aim of the new Act is
    “to balance the right of claimants to sue with the right of defendants to
    have some certainty and finality in managing their affairs.”  The new Act
    introduced several important reforms in order to maintain that balance. For
    example, it protects the right to sue by incorporating the common law doctrine
    of discoverability into the process for determining the commencement date
    of the relevant limitation period. It creates greater certainty by consolidating
    limitation periods. Section 19 eliminates limitation periods contained in
    other statutes, except those specifically referred to in the new Act or the
    Schedule to it. It also sets out a list of claims to which no limitation
    period applies in s. 16. For all other claims, the new act establishes a
    basic two-year limitation period and an ultimate limitation period of 15
    years, subject to certain adjustments. Section 4 establishes the basic limitation
    period as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. Unless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding
    shall not be commenced in respect of a claim after the second anniversary
    of the day on which the claim was discovered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    accordance with s. 4, the basic limitation period is subject to some suspensions
    and extensions that are specified in the Act. For example, ss. 6 and 7 suspend
    the running of the basic limitation period against an unrepresented minor
    or incapable person. It is also subject to suspension or extension by other
    statutes under s. 20, which provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>20. This Act does not affect the extension, suspension
    or other variation of a limitation period or other time limit by or under
    another Act.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The
        Special Circumstances Doctrine</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    special circumstances doctrine originated in Canadian jurisprudence in <i>Basarsky
    v. Quinlan</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 380. In that case, the plaintiff brought a
    claim within the applicable limitation period, but later sought to add a
    new claim after the period had expired. The Supreme Court adopted the rule
    in <i>Weldon v. Neal</i> (1887), 19 Q.B.D. 394, that an amendment cannot
    be made that would prejudice the other party by taking away the existing
    right of the time bar, except in peculiar or special circumstances that warrant
    the amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that the defendant was not prejudiced
    and exercised its power to allow the amendment on the basis of special circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    common law doctrine gradually came to be applied to motions brought under
    Rule 26 and Rule 5 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to amend pleadings
    or add parties after the expiry of a limitation period. The relevant subsections
    of these rules read as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.04(2) At any stage of a proceeding the court
    may by order add, delete or substitute a party or correct the name of a party
    incorrectly named, on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result
    that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>26.01 On motion at any stage of an action the court
    shall grant leave to amend a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice
    would result that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    of these rules refers specifically to the expiry of a limitation period or
    to the doctrine of special circumstances. However, following the line of
    cases that began with <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i>, these rules have been interpreted
    to allow a court to add or substitute a party or to add a cause of action
    after the expiry of a limitation period where special circumstances exist,
    unless the change would cause prejudice that could not be compensated for
    with either costs or an adjournment: see e.g. <i>Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy
    Ltd.</i> (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 768 (C.A.).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Application
        of Special Circumstances under the New Act</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question to be answered now is whether the legislature intended to preserve
    the court’s common law discretion to extend limitation periods under the
    new Act by applying the doctrine of special circumstances. As a matter of
    statutory interpretation, I have concluded that the answer must be no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge in this case did not refer to s. 20 of the new Act, but instead,
    relied on the special circumstances doctrine developed at common law and
    applied under Rule 26.01 and Rule 5.04(2). In fairness to the motion judge,
    the parties did not address the effect of the new Act on the special circumstances
    doctrine and appeared to assume that it was applicable. Instead, the parties
    focussed on whether the doctrine could be applied to relieve against the
    expiry of a limitation period where no action had been commenced in time,
    in contrast to cases where a new claim or a new party is sought to be added
    to an existing action that was commenced in time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    s. 4 of the new Act mandates a two-year limitation period “[u]nless this
    Act provides otherwise”, the court must look in the Act for the authority
    to derogate from the application of the two-year limitation period. These
    opening words compel the conclusion that the new Act is intended to be comprehensive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    specific provision in the new Act refers to the doctrine of special circumstances,
    or specifically allows a court to extend or suspend the running of the limitation
    period based on special circumstances. To the contrary, s. 21 of the Act
    precludes the addition of parties to an existing action after the expiry
    of a limitation period. The late addition of parties to an existing action
    was one of the main situations where the doctrine of special circumstances
    was traditionally applied at common law and under Rule 5.04(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    20, however, preserves the extension, suspension or other variation of a
    limitation period “by or under another Act.”
    The question that therefore arises is whether the special circumstances doctrine
    that courts have applied at common law and in conjunction with the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> constitutes “the extension, suspension or other variation
    of a limitation period or other time limit <i>by or under another Act</i>.”
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court recently considered the interpretation and effect of s. 20 in <i>Guillemette
    v. Doucet</i> (2007), 88 O.R. (3d) 90, a case that involved the assessment
    of a solicitor’s account under the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    S.15. Section 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act </i>provides that a client cannot
    refer an account for assessment more than 12 months after the account was
    delivered, “except under special circumstances to be proved to the satisfaction
    of the court”. This provision was not altered or repealed by the new Act.
    The client applied to assess the solicitor’s accounts more than 33 months
    after the last account was paid. However, the application judge allowed the
    account to be referred for assessment based on the special circumstances
    exception contained in s. 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting that any limitation periods in the <i>Solicitors Act </i>no longer
    applied by virtue of s. 19 of the new Act, Doherty J.A. explained the effect
    of s. 20 at paras. 25-33 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 20 retains in force any “extension, suspension
    or other variation” of a limitation period found in another statute even
    if the limitation period in that statute is itself no longer applicable to
    the claim by virtue of s. 19(1) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> places
    a further qualification on the application of the limitations periods set
    out in the Act. Section 20 provides that nothing in the <i>Limitations Act</i> will
    affect a provision in another act which extends, suspends or otherwise varies
    the limitation period found in another Act. Section 20 recognizes that individual
    statutes may provide for situations or conditions in which the limitation
    provisions in those statutes should be extended or modified. Those provisions
    may well be particularly apt for the limitation period addressed in that
    specific statute. The <i>Limitations Act</i> does not seek to standardize
    the circumstances in which limitation periods can be extended, suspended
    or otherwise varied by statute.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think the “special circumstance” qualifier in
    s. 4 of the Solicitors Act falls within s. 20 of the Limitations Act. The
    twelve month time period in s. 4 has repeatedly been described as a limitation
    period: see e.g<i>. Enterprise Rent-a-Car Co. v. Shapiro, Andrews, Finlayson</i> [(1998),
    38 O.R. (3d) 257 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )] at 260-61. Where “special circumstances” exist, the court will order an
    assessment beyond twelve months after delivery of the account, thereby effectively
    extending, suspending or otherwise varying the twelve month time limit set
    out in s. 4.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Consequently, while by virtue of s. 19 of the <i>Limitations
      Act</i>, the two year limitation period in that Act trumps the twelve month
      limitation period in s. 4, s. 20 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> preserves
      the
    “special circumstances” exception set out in s. 4 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty
    J.A. acknowledged that the effect of his interpretation of the interaction
    of the two acts in accordance with ss. 19 and 20 of the new Act was that
    there is no absolute time bar against the assessment of solicitors’ accounts,
    and that that result may seem inconsistent with the purpose of the new Act,
    which is to provide certainty in the area of limitations. However, he justified
    that inconsistency on the basis that solicitors’ accounts have always been
    treated differently from other debts or professional accounts, including
    the fact that the Superior Court has inherent jurisdiction to review those
    accounts without any time restrictions.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the interpretation of s. 20 in the context of the common law doctrine
    of special circumstances, the requirement in s. 20 that the extension must
    be “by or under another Act” clearly precludes any extension that may be
    granted at common law as opposed to statute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the extension need not be provided only “by”
    an Act but can also be provided “under” an Act. The <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> are
    enacted by the Civil Rules Committee under the authority of s. 66 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. Although the Rules are permitted
    to alter the substantive law in matters relating to practice and procedure,
    s. 66(3) provides that the Rules may not conflict with an Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with s. 66(3), rules 5.04 and 26.01 must not conflict with the
    new Act, or with the former Act. These rules apply to the amendment of pleadings
    and the addition of parties at any stage of proceedings. They do not by their
    terms apply to extend the statutory limitation periods provided in the new
    Act, nor could they. But they have been used for that purpose through the
    application of the common law doctrine of special circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the Rules themselves are authorized to be made by the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, they are arguably made “under another Act”. However, it is only
    the interpretation of the Rules by application of the common law that has
    incorporated the doctrine of special circumstances to extend limitation periods
    by adding parties or claims after the expiry of a limitation period. The
    Rules themselves do not do this. In my view, it would be extending the meaning
    of “under another Act” too far to interpret it as including the application
    of common law principles used to apply the Rules, even though the Rules themselves
    are made by regulation “under another Act”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am reinforced in my view by s. 21 of the new Act, which specifically prohibits
    the addition of parties to an existing action after the expiry of the limitation
    period. Section 20 would conflict with s. 21 if it were interpreted to extend
    to the incorporation of the common law special circumstances doctrine, thereby
    allowing the possible addition of parties after the expiry of the limitation
    period where special circumstances exist, in conflict with s. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation is also responsive to the concern raised by Doherty J.A. in <i>Guillemette</i> that
    interpreting the new Act to always allow for the possibility of extensions
    in special circumstances would effectively remove the time bar for adding
    claims after the expiry of the limitation period. Doherty J.A. addressed
    this concern in the context of that case by pointing to the unique and special
    nature of solicitors’ accounts. However, if s. 20 were interpreted to include
    the extension of limitation periods generally by the common law doctrine
    of special circumstances under the Rules, the effect would be contrary to
    the purpose of the new Act by removing the certainty of its limitation scheme.
    Instead, we would continue with the procedure that developed under the former
    Act where courts were asked to consider in detail the actions of solicitors
    who missed limitation periods by neglecting to add parties or claims, and
    to assess in each case whether there should be relief. Because an extension
    is a matter of discretion, there was always uncertainty and the perception
    of a degree of unfairness in the application of limitation periods. In my
    view, to the extent that there may be any ambiguity in s. 20, it should be
    interpreted in a manner that addresses these concerns and implements the
    purpose of the new Act.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that s. 20 does not refer to the extension of a limitation period
    under the new Act through the application of the common law doctrine of special
    circumstances to the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>. Rules 5.04(2) and 26.01
    must now be applied giving effect to the new Act.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that regard, I add for the sake of completeness that the decision of the
    motion judge, which followed a line of cases in the Superior Court where
    extensions were granted that did not involve any amendment of or addition
    to an existing action, was an error of law even had the doctrine of special
    circumstances applied. Both the common law doctrine from <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan</i> and
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> contemplate only the power to amend or
    add a claim or party to an existing action. They did not give the court the
    authority to allow an action to be commenced after the expiry of a limitation
    period.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal and make an order declaring the action
    statute barred, with costs of the motion and of the appeal to the appellant,
    fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
