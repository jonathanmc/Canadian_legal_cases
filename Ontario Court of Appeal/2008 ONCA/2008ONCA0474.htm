  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paras. 23 and 24 of the reasons, the motion judge concludes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidentiary record establishes beyond a reasonable
    doubt that:  (1) both Mr. Yates and Ms. Yates had knowledge of the nature
    of the terms of the July 14, 2006 Order (indeed, they filed responding materials
    and were represented by counsel at the time, although their counsel advised
    by fax July 13, 2006, he would not be attending July 14, 2006); (2) the July
    Order was directive and not merely permissive, and (3) their conduct was
    knowingly and intentionally in contravention of the July Order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find beyond a reasonable doubt that both Mr.
    and Mrs. Yates were in contempt of the July Order.  Mr. and Mrs. Yates intentionally
    ignored the July Order until the motion for contempt was brought and first
    heard October 11, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so concluding, it is apparent that the motion judge applied the law in making
    a finding of contempt.  In light of his findings, some of which are set out
    above, it is readily apparent that the third criterion was met.  The extensive
    record before the motion judge demonstrated that the appellants had been
    given notice of the July Order and were well aware of its terms; four written
    requests had been made to the appellants’ counsel requiring compliance prior
    to the contempt motion material being served; the motion materials were served
    well in advance of the motion; at the first day of the hearing of the contempt
    motion, the appellants had provided no documents or information in respect
    of the July Order; and, at the conclusion of the contempt hearing two months
    later, the vast majority of the required documents and information had not
    been provided.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the first two criteria, we acknowledge that the terms of the July
    Order are broad.  However, the motion material provided a clear and unequivocal
    statement as to what information was necessary in order to fulfill the July
    Order.  There could have been no uncertainty in the minds of the appellants
    as to what had to be done to fulfill the terms of the July Order, to prevent
    the contempt motion from proceeding or, once under way, what was required
    to purge their contempt.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE COSTS ORDER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that the motion judge failed to consider various relevant
    factors, including the Yates’ reasonable expectations as to the quantum of
    costs, when fixing costs.  We see nothing in this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also allege that the quantum of the Costs Order was unreasonable
    given the evidence before the motion judge that the Bank’s costs were only
    just in excess of $50,000 in mid July of 2006.  The motion judge was aware
    that the Bank estimated its costs in July of 2006 to be in the neighbourhood
    of $50,000.  However, the motion judge was also aware of the work that was
    done on the contempt motion between July 2006 and April 18, 2007, the date
    on which he made the Costs Order.  In this regard, it is useful to keep in
    mind that the two and a half day contempt motion - over which the motion
    judge presided - took place on October 11, November 28 and December 11, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following facts are also germane.  The reasons for the Contempt Order fixed
    April 18, 2007, as the hearing date in respect of sentencing for the contempt.  Mr.
    and Ms. Yates did not appear on April 18, 2007, and the motion judge fixed
    costs in their absence.  He also rescheduled the sentencing hearing for May
    2, 2007.  On that date, Mr. and Ms. Yates appeared with counsel and sought
    to have the Costs Order set aside.  The motion judge accepted the Yates’ explanation
    for failing to appear at the April 18<sup>th</sup> hearing and reconsidered
    the Costs Order.  At para. 12 of the reasons released on June 26, 2007, he
    rejected the Yates’
    argument that the quantum of costs was unreasonable saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[12]     In my view, and I so find, the Bill of
    Costs for $91,620.92 is fair and reasonable considering all the circumstances.
    A great deal of work was required of the Bank’s counsel in the course of
    bringing the motion for contempt and the hearing thereof.                     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the motion judge reviewed the Bank’s Bill of Costs and was
    satisfied that the Bank was entitled to the amounts claimed on a full indemnity
    basis.  We see no basis on which to interfere with the motion judge’s exercise
    of discretion.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed, leave to appeal the costs order is granted but the
    costs appeal is dismissed, with costs of the appeal to the respondent fixed
    at $22,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
