    was not an appropriate case for a conditional sentence given the gravity
    of the offences. The respondent committed a series of sexual assaults on
    his son’s seventeen-year-old girlfriend. In the most serious incident, he
    video taped his attempt to analy rape the complainant. He then threatened
    to provide the video tape to his son if the victim did not comply with his
    further demands. This pattern of conduct involved threats, extortion and
    sexual assault over a period of time and required a penitentiary sentence
    notwithstanding the respondent’s previous good character, the exceptional
    care he has provided to his wife and his mental disorder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge had the advantage of hearing submissions and actually viewing
    the video tape, we are of the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate
    and requires our intervention. We accept, of course, the submissions of respondent’s
    counsel as to nature of the events depicted on the tape but note that even
    the trial judge described the acts in this way: “On the evidence available
    to me, this was an abhorrent, repulsive combination of evil acts carried
    out by a mature person with no criminal record”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appropriate sentence would have been five years imprisonment,
    however, given the lengthy pre-trial custody and that the appellant has now
    spent nine months on the conditional sentence, the appropriate disposition
    is fifteen months in custody. That represents the balance of the conditional
    sentence and was the disposition sought by the Crown appellant.</p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence varied
    to fifteen months imprisonment to commence on the day the respondent surrenders
    into custody. The three-year term of probation will remain on the conditions
    imposed by the trial judge.</p>
