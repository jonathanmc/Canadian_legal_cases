    is a Crown appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal on a charge of first
    degree murder. The trial proceeded for eleven days before Nadeau J. and a
    jury. At the conclusion of the Crown’s case and after forty-four witnesses
    had been called, the defence moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. The
    trial judge acceded to that request, withdrew the case from the jury, and
    entered a verdict of acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, no issue was taken with the fact that the deceased, Ronald Godin,
    had been murdered. The only real issue was whether the respondent was the
    person who killed him. On that issue, the case for the Crown was entirely
    circumstantial. Before us, the Crown maintained that the strength of its
    position lay not in individual pieces of evidence but in a series of facts
    summarized below that were unlikely to exist as a matter of coincidence:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      The
    deceased, Godin, had recently adjusted an insurance claim arising from a
    fire at the respondent’s home. In that capacity, he was pursuing repayment
    of a G.S.T rebate that had been owing by the respondent to the insurer for
    about a year. The evidence showed that the respondent had cashed the rebate
    cheque but had repeatedly denied to Godin that he had received it;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      As
    a result of a request from his supervisor, Godin was to make a cold call
    at the respondent’s home to pursue repayment of the G.S.T. rebate;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      On
    the morning of January 29, 2004 (the day on which Godin disappeared), there
    was a twenty-second telephone call from the respondent’s home to Godin. Telephone
    records show that the call was answered;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Godin
    was last seen at a time when he could physically have made a surprise visit
    to the respondent’s home;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      When
    Godin’s body was found, there was a
    “to-do” note in his pocket reminding him to contact the respondent;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Godin
    did not attend his regular dart game scheduled at Dante’s for 7:30 p.m. on
    the evening of the 29th, nor did he respond to a telephone message left between
    6:00 and 6:15 p.m. that day by his friend Demers, with whom he had a standing
    arrangement to give a ride to the dart game;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(7)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      A
    car similar to Godin’s car was seen near the respondent’s home on two succeeding
    nights that may have coincided with Godin’s disappearance;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(8)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Godin’s
    car, which was used to dispose off his body, was later found at a parking
    lot within walking distance of the respondent’s home;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(9)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>      Paint
    chips found in the trunk of Godin’s car were chemically consistent with the
    paint on the respondent’s carport;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(10)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Godin’s body was found, a piece of chrome from the bumper of the respondent’s
    car was found imbedded in snow attached to Godin’s jacket; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(11)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent for some reason chose to pay back the G.S.T. rebate hours after
    the police had released information that the blood found in Godin’s vehicle
    matched Godin’s blood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the Crown relied on evidence of motive, opportunity, forensic evidence
    and after-the-fact conduct to implicate the respondent as Godin’s killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is against this backdrop that the trial judge determined that the case should
    be removed from the jury’s consideration. His extensive reasons reveal that
    he was aware of the governing legal principles and the test that must be
    met for a directed verdict. However, in our respectful view, it is in the
    application of those principles that the trial judge went wrong. To be precise,
    he went further than he should have in the weighing process and ended up
    effectively trying the case. Moreover, in our view, he assessed the evidence
    on a piecemeal basis instead of considering it as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue on the directed verdict motion was whether there was some evidence
    upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably convict. For purposes
    of this case, that issue translated into the following question – was the
    evidence favouring the Crown capable of establishing, on the criminal standard,
    that the respondent was the person who killed Godin?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    deciding that issue, the trial judge was to take the case for the Crown at
    its highest and in doing so, it was incumbent upon him to resolve competing
    permissible inferences in favour of the Crown. That he did not do. On the
    contrary, he addressed the evidence on a piecemeal basis, weighed the various
    inferences individually and ultimately resolved them in favour of the respondent
    as opposed to the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of illustration, on the issue of motive, the trial judge considered the
    G.S.T debt to be a weak motive and one which the respondent would not likely
    act on to commit a “brutal murder”. As such, in the trial judge’s view, its
    probative value in identifying the respondent as the killer was “substantially
    reduced”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the question of motive and its strength were matters for the jury,
    to be assessed in the context of the case as a whole. Animus between the
    respondent and Godin over the G.S.T debt could, in our view, amount to evidence
    of motive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    example is found in the trial judge’s treatment of the respondent’s “after-the-fact” conduct
    in settling his debt with the insurance company when he did. The trial judge
    found that the timing of the payment was consistent with a threat by the
    insurer that it would turn the matter over to its lawyers. He further found
    that the respondent’s ability at the time to pay his bills was inconsistent
    with the Crown’s theory that he was
    “under extreme financial difficulty”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, we point out that there was evidence on the record to the effect
    that the respondent had not received the letter from the insurer threatening
    legal action before he made the payment. Moreover, there was no evidence
    that the respondent was paying his bills at the relevant time as found by
    the trial judge. The fact that the after-the-fact conduct may have been subject
    to competing inferences is acknowledged. The trial judge’s selection of the
    version that favoured the respondent however, constituted error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same can be said for the trial judge’s rejection of Ms. Lamothe’s evidence
    identifying a car similar to Godin’s car near the respondent’s home in and
    around the time of Godin’s disappearance. Acknowledging, as we do, that there
    were problems with Ms. Lamothe’s evidence, surely it was for the jury to
    decide if she was mistaken in her description of the car and the timing of
    the sighting. This, on our respectful view, is an instance where the trial
    judge effectively usurped the function of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    examples exist. Perhaps the most egregious is the trial judge’s treatment
    of the forensic evidence. Here, he virtually ignored the evidence that favoured
    the Crown’s position and chose instead to act on competing evidence and inferences
    that favoured the respondent. With respect, it was not for the trial judge
    to sort out how and under what circumstances paint chips consistent with
    paint from the respondent’s carport came to be on Godin’s trunk. More importantly,
    it was not for the trial judge to determine how a piece of chrome from the
    respondent’s bumper could have become attached to Godin’s jacket. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    were matters for the jury, to be assessed in the context of the whole of
    the evidence; they were not for the trial judge to resolve on his own. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, regardless of the ultimate strength of the Crown’s case, we are satisfied
    that had the trial judge applied the governing principles correctly, he would
    have found on the circumstantial evidence taken as a whole that it was open
    for a jury, properly instructed, to return a verdict of guilty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed, the verdict of acquittal is set aside
    and a new trial is ordered.</p>
