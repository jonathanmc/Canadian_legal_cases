  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was charged with five armed robberies, all of which occurred over
    a six week period in central-east
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton near where the appellant lived.  On a pre-trial motion, the trial
    judge granted severance and directed that the five robbery charges be divided
    into two indictments.  One indictment contained the charges relating to three
    robberies that occurred between October 2 and 14, 1999.  The trial judge
    ruled that these three robbery charges could be tried together as the evidence
    on each count was admissible on the other counts.  This trial proceeded first.  The
    appellant did not testify.  The jury convicted the appellant on all three
    robbery charges and several related offences. The appellant was also charged
    with assaulting a police officer. This charge arose out of an altercation
    between the appellant and a plainclothes police detective at the time of
    the appellant’s arrest.  The jury acquitted on the charge of assaulting a
    police officer and convicted on the included offence of assault <i>simpliciter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second trial on the two remaining robbery charges and several related offences
    proceeded immediately after the completion of the first trial.  The trial
    judge held that the evidence with respect to these two charges was not admissible
    as similar fact evidence in respect of the other three robbery charges or
    in respect of each other.  These robberies occurred in August and September
    of 1999.  The appellant did testify at this trial.  He denied any involvement
    in either robbery.  The jury convicted on both robberies and the related
    charges.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge imposed a life sentence on one of the robbery charges and several
    concurrent sentences of fixed duration.  </p>

    for the appellant has raised several grounds of appeal.  Some of the grounds
    of appeal apply to both trials, some apply to the first trial only, and others
    apply to the second trial only.  In addressing the grounds of appeal, we
    follow the format set out by counsel for the appellant in their factum.  </p>
  <h1><span style='"Times New Roman"'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE
    CONVICTION APPEAL</h1>
  <h2><span style='
text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Global Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two issues that apply to both trials.  First, the appellant submits that
    he was denied his right to trial within a reasonable time as guaranteed by
    s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and that a stay of proceedings should be entered
    on all charges.  Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge should
    have ruled that none of the evidence pertaining to any of the robberies was
    admissible in respect of the other robberies; therefore, he should have severed
    all five robbery charges from each other.    </p>
  <h3><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      The
    Section 11(b) Claim</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was arrested October 14, 1999, the day of the last of the five
    robberies.  He was not sentenced until almost five years later on July 26,
    2004.  Clearly, the passage of some fifty-six months engages the analysis
    required by s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge heard a lengthy s. 11(b) motion prior to trial.  He conducted
    a thorough and careful review of the relevant factors.  Counsel for the appellant
    candidly concedes that he cannot quarrel with the trial judge’s factual findings
    on the motion, the trial judge’s characterization of the various time intervals,
    or the inferences that the trial judge drew from his primary findings of
    fact.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge carefully reviewed the pained progress of these charges through
    the criminal justice system.  He ultimately found that of the fifty-six months
    that it took for these charges to pass through the trial system only sixteen
    could be attributable to the Crown.  None could be attributed to any Crown
    misconduct.  The trial judge concluded that the vast majority of the remaining
    forty months was attributable to the conduct of the appellant. This conduct
    included, but was not limited to, requests for adjournments on the first
    two trial dates and an indication that a guilty plea would be forthcoming
    (later retracted), which resulted in an adjournment on a third fixed trial
    date.  This conduct is briefly canvassed below.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge quite properly focused on the events after this case got to the
    Superior Court.  It had moved through the preliminary inquiry stage with
    reasonable dispatch.  When the matter first arrived in the Superior Court,
    it was anticipated that a seven day trial would be needed.  Within three
    months, a trial date in July 2001 had been set.  This date was about nine
    months after the matter arrived in the Superior Court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this first trial date, the defence requested an adjournment.  Counsel for
    the appellant specifically waived the appellant’s rights under s. 11(b) “from
    this date to the next trial date”.  The validity of that waiver was questioned
    in the appellant’s factum.  However, in oral argument counsel accepted that
    the waiver was an informed, valid waiver.  We agree with that concession.  Like
    the trial judge, we see no reason not to give full force and effect to the
    waiver.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellant made several appearances in the months after the trial was
    adjourned, counsel did not set a second trial date until February 2002.  The
    trial was set for two weeks in July 2002.  Four days before the trial was
    to proceed, the defence requested another adjournment.  Once again, counsel
    for the appellant waived his rights under s. 11(b) “from today’s date to
    the next trial date”.  Like the appellant’s waiver a year earlier, this was
    an informed, unqualified, express s. 11(b) waiver of any time between July
    2002 and the next trial date.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About
    six weeks after the second trial date was lost, a third trial date of November
    25, 2002 was fixed.  The appellant appeared in court on several occasions
    before that trial date.  As the trial date approached, it appeared that the
    appellant had decided to plead guilty.  The trial date came and passed in
    anticipation of the appellant’s guilty plea.  No plea was in fact entered,
    and shortly after the trial date had passed, the appellant changed his mind
    and decided that he would not plead guilty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s change of heart precipitated a further delay to allow his lawyer
    to bring a motion to be removed from the record.  The appellant eventually
    obtained new counsel in May 2003.  A pre-trial was conducted in November
    2003, and pre-trial motions were heard beginning in February 2004.  The first
    of his two trials began in March 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    the abbreviated summary of the relevant chronology set out above, belies
    the appellant’s submission that this case “got lost in the system” and was
    allowed to move at a snail’s pace because no one turned their attention to
    the need for a trial within a reasonable time.  In fact, the appellant was
    given a trial date in July 2001, well within the constitutional time limits
    prescribed by s. 11(b).  He chose to seek an adjournment of that trial date.  He
    also chose, no doubt to ensure that he would get the adjournment, to waive
    any right to rely on the passage of time between the adjournment and the
    next trial date.  As indicated in <i>R. v. N.N.M.</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C.
    (3d) 436 at para. 55 (O.C.A.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 11(b)
    of the <i>Charter</i> guarantees a person charged with an offence “the right
    to be tried within a reasonable time”.  There is, therefore, no infringement
    of s. 11(b) where the state offers the accused a trial date within a reasonable
    time, and the accused refuses the offer and delays the proceeding further.  In
    such a case, the accused’s right to a trial within a reasonable time has
    been protected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant followed exactly the same course of action on a second occasion,
    once again using the waiver of his s. 11(b) rights to ensure that his trial
    would be delayed by the granting of a further adjournment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s
    argument comes down to the claim that regardless of who is responsible for
    the delay in these proceedings, the delay was so inordinate that it must
    have infringed the appellant’s rights under s. 11(b).  This submission misses
    an important distinction between delay that is excessive and potentially
    harmful to the administration of justice, and delay that results in the violation
    of an individual’s constitutional rights under s. 11(b).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    accused cannot manufacture delay, using a waiver of his s. 11(b) rights as
    a to secure that delay, and then argue that the delay produced a breach of
    those very same constitutional rights that he waived to secure the delay.  On
    the trial judge’s findings, that is exactly what the appellant is trying
    to do in this case.  The trial judge observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>During his stay
    in Superior Court, the accused was in court no less than thirty-seven times
    without complaint, directly or through his counsel, …  During this time,
    he hired four lawyers, he adjourned three fixed trial dates, created two
    guilty plea dates without pleading and brought three different severance
    motions.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The conduct,
    the manoeuvres of the accused from the time he came into Superior Court was
    consistent with the delay strategy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notably,
    the trial judge’s findings that the appellant deliberately sought to delay
    the proceedings were confirmed by information that came out in the sentencing
    proceedings.  The appellant knew, given his record and the seriousness of
    the charges, that convictions for any of the offences would result in long
    jail terms.  The Crown’s case was overwhelming on at least two of the robbery
    charges.  The appellant did not want to go to the penitentiary because of
    certain enemies that he had there.  He also knew that it was customary to
    give two-for-one credit for pre-trial incarceration.  Persons in pre-trial
    incarceration are not held in the penitentiary.  The appellant knew that
    the longer he could delay his trial thereby accumulating additional pre-trial
    incarceration with a two-for-one credit, the better his chances were to avoid
    an ultimate sentence to the penitentiary.  That was his strategy.  To suggest
    that the appellant’s attempts to manipulate the process should somehow be
    characterized as a violation of his constitutional rights is an affront to
    both common sense and the principles underlying the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    s. 11(b) motion at trial was devoid of merit.  So is this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    outlined above, the trial judge severed the five robbery charges into two
    groups.  The first group included the three October robberies.  The trial
    judge held that these robberies could be tried together as evidence pertaining
    to one was potentially admissible as similar fact evidence in relation to
    the other robberies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that while there were similarities in the circumstances
    surrounding the three robberies that were tried together, the trial judge
    erred in giving no weight to significant dissimilarities.  Counsel contends
    that when these dissimilarities are factored into the evidentiary mix, the
    evidence does not come up to the high admissibility standard set out in <i>R.
    v. Arp</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons reflect a full appreciation of the evidence and the
    applicable legal principles.  His ruling that the evidence was sufficiently
    probative to warrant its admissibility as similar fact evidence is entitled
    to deference:  <i>R. v. Arp</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    were many similarities among the three robberies.  Taken in combination,
    these similarities are capable of presenting a compelling argument that the
    three robberies were committed by the same person or persons.  The robberies
    occurred within ten days of each other at three similar locations that were
    located close to each other in central-east
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton.  The perpetrator’s <i>modus operandi</i> and the weapon carried
    by him in the three robberies were very similar to each other.  A female
    accomplice was involved in all three robberies.  There was no indication
    that the female accomplice was armed in any of the robberies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    dissimilarities relied on by the appellant are not really discrete factual
    issues; rather, they are features of the evidence that could detract somewhat
    from the force of the similarities relied on by the Crown.  For example,
    while the Crown relies on the fact that the three robberies targeted small,
    single-employee, retail outlets as a similarity, the appellant points out
    that a different kind of business was carried out at each of the venues robbed
    and suggests that this is an important dissimilarity.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    distinctions drawn by the appellant are relevant to the admissibility of
    the evidence and were no doubt put before the trial judge.  However, the
    trial judge did not fall into reversible error by failing to advert to all
    of the evidentiary arguments for and against admissibility.  No one suggested
    that the three robberies were identical.  The trial judge properly focussed
    on the degree of similarity in analyzing the evidence to determine whether
    the <i>Arp</i> standard was met.  We see no error in that analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the evidence in respect of the robbery at the
    Cumberland Variety should not have been admitted.  Chronologically, this
    robbery was the second of the three robberies.  Counsel contends that there
    was no evidentiary link connecting the appellant to that robbery.  Absent
    that link, the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland robbery could not be admitted as similar fact evidence in relation
    to the other two robberies:  see  <i>R. v. Sweitzer</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C.
    (2d) 193 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant is correct in maintaining that there must be evidence connecting
    him to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Cumberland robbery before it can be used as evidence in respect of the other
    robberies.  It is also fair to say that the evidence connecting the appellant
    to the robbery at the Cumberland Variety was not strong.  No one identified
    the appellant as being involved in that robbery.  The appellant was, however,
    arrested about four days after the Cumberland Variety robbery.  He was in
    possession of a gun and a mask that were very similar to those used in that
    robbery.  He was also in possession of cash and packages of wrapped, unopened
    cigarettes.  The robber stole cash and cigarettes from the Cumberland Variety.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that this evidence was sufficient to provide the necessary
    link between the appellant and the Cumberland Variety robbery, and on this
    ground he opened the evidentiary door to the similar fact evidence.  In so
    holding, the trial judge appreciated that the potential value of this evidence
    was arguably weakened by the fact that on the Crown’s theory, the appellant
    was involved in another robbery on October 14, in which he also stole cigarettes
    and cash.  He was entitled to find that the evidence provided the link between
    the appellant and the Cumberland Variety robbery.  We would not interfere
    with that finding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s severance order was an exercise of his discretion.  That order
    is entitled to deference on appeal.  Having upheld the trial judge’s ruling
    on the similar fact evidence, there is no basis upon which to interfere with
    his decision that those three charges could be tried together.  </p>

    trial judge’s decision to try the other two robbery charges together, even
    though he held the evidence on one was not admissible on the other, does
    not mean that his decision to refuse severance of these two counts amounted
    to an improper exercise of his discretion.  Severance motions require a consideration
    of the broad interests of justice and not just the interests of the accused.  Multiple
    trials and the potential for inconsistent verdicts are a genuine concern.  It
    is not enough to convince this court that the trial judge could have severed
    these two counts; rather, the appellant must satisfy this court that the
    trial judge was obliged upon a proper consideration of the interests of justice
    to sever these two counts.</p>

    are satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to proceed with one trial
    on the two robbery counts even though the evidence of one was not admissible
    in respect of the other.  The trial judge carefully and correctly instructed
    the jury to consider the evidence on each count separately.  The appellant’s
    defence on this second trial –
    namely, that he did not commit either robbery and was targeted by the police
    because of his background – was in no way compromised by trying the two counts
    together.  </p>

    robbery at the Cumberland Variety on October 10 was committed by a masked
    man armed with a double-barrelled gun.  He was assisted by a female accomplice.  The
    victim of that robbery was shown a  photo line-up of females three days later.  She
    selected a photograph and was sure that it was the female who had assisted
    the armed man in the robbery.  The person identified by the victim, referred

    the first trial, the trial judge was satisfied that any reference to Ms.
    Mason’s guilty plea could be very prejudicial to the appellant.  Counsel

    defence had a dilemma concerning the eyewitness identification of the female
    accomplice in the Cumberland Variety robbery. On the one hand, the defence
    was anxious to keep from the jury the fact that the appellant’s girlfriend,
    who was living with the appellant at the time, had pleaded guilty to that
    robbery.  At the same time, the defence wanted to be able to suggest that
    the victim in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland robbery had correctly picked out the female accomplice, and that
    the person picked out was not Ms. Mason and was not known to the appellant.  The
    question became – how far could the defence go in questioning with respect
    to the identification of the female accomplice in the Cumberland robbery
    without opening the door to evidence that Ms. Mason was that accomplice and
    had pleaded guilty to that robbery?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    matter came up in argument on several occasions in the course of the trial.  The
    trial judge ultimately held that the evidence of the photo line-up could
    go before the jury as could the fact that Ms. “A”, the person picked out
    of the line-up by the victim, had been eliminated as a suspect.  The trial
    judge held that the actual identity of Miss “A” was irrelevant.  The trial
    judge also changed his earlier ruling and held that counsel could not elicit
    evidence that Miss “A” was not Yolanda Mason.  In his view, the only purpose
    of leading this evidence was to suggest to the jury that Yolanda Mason was
    not the perpetrator.  The trial judge observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>That inference
    would be against what we know to be true, namely Yolanda Mason is guilty
    by virtue of her earlier plea.  It would be wrong to lead evidence or to
    argue a position that suggests that Yolanda Mason might be innocent.</p>

    trial judge was doing his best to allow the appellant latitude to lead any
    evidence that might help the appellant, without allowing what the trial judge
    saw as misleading information to be placed before the jury as to the identity
    of the female accomplice.  </p>

    agree with the substance of the trial judge’s ruling, although our analysis
    is somewhat different.  Ms. Mason’s guilty plea in a separate proceeding
    would not in law preclude the appellant in his trial from leading evidence
    to demonstrate that she was not the perpetrator, assuming that evidence was
    relevant to a fact in issue at his trial.  If the defendant chose to lead
    that evidence, however, he would open the door to evidence from the Crown
    that Ms. Mason was in fact the female accomplice.  This evidence could include
    evidence of her guilty plea if adduced in a properly admissible form.  The
    defence clearly did not want to go down that path as evinced by the earlier
    successful mistrial application.</p>

    he argues that the trial judge improperly admitted a sawed-off shotgun and
    mask found in possession of the appellant when he was arrested on October
    14.  Counsel submits that neither object had any connection to the two robberies
    that were the subject matter of the second trial.  Counsel also argues that

    evidence that the appellant was in possession of a loaded sawed-off shotgun
    when arrested was relevant as a piece of circumstantial evidence going to
    his identification as the perpetrator of the two robberies that were the
    subject matter of the second trial.  The weapon was similar in appearance
    to the distinctive weapon used in those robberies and was in a bag that was
    very similar to a bag identified by the victim of one of the robberies.  The
    trial judge clearly instructed the jury on the limited use it could make
    of this evidence.</p>

    his testimony, the appellant, in the course of being questioned as to his

    appellant’s examination-in-chief opened him up to cross-examination on his
    knowledge of the contents of the bag and on the question of whether he had
    in fact committed the October robberies.  One of those robberies had occurred
    very shortly before his arrest.  The contents of the bag provided significant
    insight into the credibility of the appellant’s denial of any involvement

    also reject the submission that even if the subject matter of the cross-examination

    a cross-examination that was abusive, thereby rendering the trial unfair.  Most
    of the information that the appellant now complains was improperly adduced
    to blacken his character was in reality brought out by the appellant himself
    during his examination-in-chief.  The appellant attempted to depict himself
    as an honest criminal who acknowledged his responsibility for the crimes
    he committed.  The impugned cross-examination, while forceful, was aimed
    at clarifying or challenging the evidence brought out during examination-in-chief.  The

    instruction was important because the appellant had given detailed testimony

    July 26, 2007 the appellant received a life sentence on one of the robbery
    counts and various concurrent terms on the other offences. Life imprisonment
    is the maximum penalty for armed robbery provided under the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985 c. C-46.  Section 344(a) provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Every person
    who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offense and liable (a) where
    a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life
    and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years.</p>

line-height:normal'><span class=verdana>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While,
    as the Crown recognizes, a sentence of life imprisonment is rarely imposed
    for armed robbery, the normal principles govern appellate review. An appellate
    court must show substantial deference to the sentence chosen by the judge
    who presided at the trial and sentencing hearing. An appellate court may
    interfere with a sentence only if the judge<span
class=verdana> has committed an </span><a name="ORIGHIT_13"></a><a name="HIT_13"></a><span
class=hit>error</span><span class=verdana> in principle, the judge has failed

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge began his reasons for sentence by restating the statutory principle
    that &quot;the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along
    with crime prevention initiatives, a respect for the law and the maintenance
    of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions... “as well
    as that” a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offense and
    the degree of the responsibility of the offender.&quot;</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge took note of the Victim Impact Statements filed by the individual
    victims of the appellant's crimes. Understandably, they were traumatized
    by having a loaded sawed-off shotgun pointed at them. The trial judge said
    they continued to suffer horror, broken psyches and spirits, though he added
    that the appellant had not inflicted any actual physical harm on them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the appellant’s criminal record. It commenced when,
    at the age of sixteen, he was first convicted of assault and mischief to
    public property. Two months later, he was convicted of break and enter with
    theft and fail to appear. Then, at the age of seventeen, he was convicted
    of robbery.  At the time of sentencing in this case, his criminal record,
    including these convictions, contained forty-nine convictions, thirty-six
    of which, the trial judge characterized as involving violence in some fashion.
    The record includes nine robberies, seven assaults, and four break and enters.
    The appellant was forty-one years of age.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    presentence report before the judge incorporated excerpts of three psychologists’ reports
    that had been prepared for earlier sentencing proceedings. These indicated
    that the appellant has “an organic mental disorder with behavioural disturbance,
    presumably the result of a head trauma during childhood”, that he has “an
    antisocial personality disorder complicated by substance abuse”, and that “it
    would be difficult to minimize his risk for future violence as this has become
    habitual.” The medical reports also indicated the appellant is noncompliant
    in taking medications to reduce his aggressiveness. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also introduced evidence that the appellant’s aggressiveness continued
    during his pre-trial custody. Specifically, he had nine “misconducts”, including
    assaults on staff and threatening an officer. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant’s substance abuse continues to be habitual
    without any indication that he intends to stop using cocaine or seek counselling.  The
    trial judge found that crime was the appellant's occupation and that robbery
    was a significant method by which he obtained his income.  While he had not
    physically harmed any of the victims, these offences carried a high potential
    for serious violence. The trial judge observed, “[w]ith a loaded shotgun,
    crack cocaine, heightened adrenaline of the players, and closely accompanied
    by the randomness of life in a variety store robbery, it is more by good
    luck and good management that something even worse did not happen.”</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    all this, the trial judge noted that the <i>Criminal Code</i> and case law
    obligated him to impose a sentence that protects society and sends a message
    that the use of firearms carries with it the stiffest of penalties. He said
    that “the community looks to the Court to give some measure of expression
    of their revulsion of violence and guns.” The primary goals of sentencing
    in this case were the protection of the public, and general and specific
    deterrence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, in summing up his assessment of the appellant, stated the appellant
    had “dangerous and violent behavioural characteristics that seemed to be
    well entrenched. He has repetitive manifestations of his antisocial behaviour
    and he does so at times with a loaded gun in his hands”.  Most significant
    for this sentence appeal is that the trial judge concluded that the appellant
    is incorrigible and poses a continuing threat to public safety.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge observed that a life sentence would mean that the appellant would
    remain subject to the Parole Board for the rest of his life. His eligibility
    to apply for parole would create “the largest incentive for self rehabilitation
    and good conduct, whereas a fixed but determinative sentence is a limited
    incentive at best.” He added that “a life sentence would, once he is paroled,
    allow for better control, a quicker response, and a heightened and lasting
    vigilance of his conduct. The sentence stays with him and his liberty can
    be modified depending on his behaviour.”</p>

    the need for denunciation, general and specific deterrence and for a rehabilitative
    incentive, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment on
    count number one and to various concurrent terms on the other counts.</p>

    in <i>R v. Klair</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 285, the appellant submitted

    offenders in <i>Cheddesingh </i>and<i> Klair</i> were each being sentenced
    for a single incident.  There is no principle that a maximum sentence cannot
    be imposed except in cases involving the above features.  Adopting the factors
    suggested by the appellant as prerequisites to a life sentence would result
    in the same improper fettering of the trial judge’s discretion as occurred
    with the now discarded concept of “stark horror”.  As the Supreme Court held
    in <i>Cheddesingh </i>the sentencing inquiry must proceed on a case-by-case
    basis and the maximum sentence will be appropriate if the offense is of sufficient
    gravity and the offender displays a sufficient blameworthiness.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has previously upheld a sentence of life imprisonment for robbery.
    In<i> R. v. Stairs</i> (1994) 73 O.A.C. 79, the offender received a life
    sentence for a single robbery of a delicatessen using an imitation handgun.  He
    was forty-seven years old and had six prior convictions for robbery commencing
    when he was twenty-one years of age.  At the time he was sentenced he was
    facing two additional charges of robbery.  He had been continuously in the
    penitentiary system for the previous fifteen years, except when he was unlawfully
    at large, at which times he had resumed his dangerous criminal activities.  The
    substantial sentence he had received in the past had not deterred or rehabilitated
    him.  He showed no remorse and there was no evidence “that his outlook towards
    a continued career in crime has changed”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    upholding the sentence of life imprisonment in <i>Stairs</i>, this court
    stated that
    “the overriding principle that should guide us in this case is the requirement
    for the protection of the public.” The court adopted the statement of the
    British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v Ko</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d)
    430 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The criminal
    record and incorrigibility of a convicted person may be such as to justify
    the imposition of a maximum sentence to deter the convict and protect the
    public although the circumstances of the particular crime committed do not
    justify categorizing it as one of the worst of its kind.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, there was an ample basis for the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellant is incorrigible and poses a continuing threat to public safety.  The
    appellant is a career criminal who has spent a great deal of his adult life
    in prison and whose prospects for rehabilitation are minimal.  Given that
    armed robbery seems to have become his crime of choice, he poses a great
    and continuing danger to the community. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant was convicted of four counts of armed robbery, one count of robbery
    which also involved the use of a firearm, three counts of pointing a firearm,
    four counts of weapons dangerous, one count of wearing a disguise, and one
    count of common assault.  The gravity of the offence of armed robbery is
    apparent as the Criminal Code prescribes a punishment from a minimum of four
    years imprisonment up to a maximum of life imprisonment.  This court has
    repeatedly stated that armed robbery of small convenience stores and gas
    bars pose heightened dangers to the vulnerable merchants and employees who
    work alone at all hours.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the gravity of the appellant’s offences, and their actual and potential impact
    upon the victims, his unbroken criminal record, his entrenched pattern of
    violent behaviour that has become habitual, the medical reports of his antisocial
    personality disorder, his minimal prospects for rehabilitation and demonstrated
    lack of any wish to change, the trial judge did not err in principle in imposing
    a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
  <h3>(ii) Did
    the trial judge err in imposing a life sentence to keep the appellant under
    the control of the Parole Board?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    argument of the appellant focuses on the trial judge’s remarks that “a life
    sentence would mean that [the appellant] is subject to the Parole Board” and
    that the “advantage of a life sentence in these circumstances is that it
    creates the largest incentive for self rehabilitation and good conduct, whereas
    a fixed or determinative sentence is a limited incentive at best”.  The appellant
    also points out that the trial judge observed, “[a] life sentence would,
    once he is paroled, allow for better control, a quicker response, and a heightened
    and lasting of vigilance of his conduct”.  Finally, the trial judge indicated
    that he was “loath to allow [the appellant] back into the community at the
    end of his sentence without some realistic and continuing controls beyond
    that provided in a halfway house for a short period of time on this particular
    offender”.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by considering the parole implications
    of the sentence being imposed.  This court, in <i>R. v. Wilmott</i>, [1967]
    1 C.C.C. 171 disapproved of a court increasing a sentence to keep the offender
    under the control of the Parole Board.  That, however, did not occur here. <i>Wilmott </i>specifically
    stated that “a Court in determining an appropriate sentence of imprisonment
    may, quite properly, take into consideration the provisions of the <i>Parole
    Act</i> and the duties of the Parole Board under the Act and Regulations.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accurately described the parole implications of the sentence
    he considered appropriate and which he decided to impose.  He might have
    added the observation that the appellant, having received a life sentence,
    will be eligible for parole in seven years, whereas, ironically, had he received
    an appropriate determinate sentence, his period of parole ineligibility would
    likely have been longer.</p>
