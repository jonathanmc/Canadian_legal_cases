style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the centre of this action is a small child, Rachel Sherman-Litman, now five
    years old.  The parties are her parents, whose marriage lasted less than
    a year.  They separated when the respondent, Adina Sherman (the “mother”),
    was seven months pregnant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of a fifteen-day trial, the trial judge dealt with custody,
    access, spousal and child support, and ancillary issues.  The appellant,
    Mark Litman (the “father”), appeals the trial judge’s decision granting custody
    to the mother, and he seeks leave to appeal the trial judge’s costs order. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    she sought to vary the then existing support order. </p>
  <h2>The Background Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties married on
    <st1:date Year="2002"
Day="26" Month="4" w:st="on">
    April 26, 2002.  Their marriage was short-lived and acrimonious; they separated
    on
    <st1:date Year="2003" Day="2" Month="4" w:st="on">
    April 2, 2003 and are now divorced.  Rachel was born

    June 10, 2003.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after Rachel’s birth, the father brought an application for custody or joint
    custody of his daughter.  In response, the mother claimed an equalization
    of the parties’ net family property, spousal and child support, and exclusive
    possession of the matrimonial home.  The mother also sought a restraining
    order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    <st1:date Year="2003" Day="30" Month="7"
w:st="on">
    July 30, 2003, MacKinnon J. ordered an assessment of the parenting issues.  The
    assessment was to be conducted by Dr. Raymond Morris.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties resolved their financial dispute through mediation.  Among other
    matters, the parties agreed that the father would pay $2,000.00 in satisfaction
    of the mother’s spousal support claim.  This agreement resulted in minutes
    of settlement, dated
    <st1:date Year="2003" Day="2"
Month="10" w:st="on">
    October 2, 2003, which were incorporated into an order of Eberhard J., dated
    <st1:date Year="2003" Day="3" Month="12" w:st="on">
    December 3, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    these financial issues were being resolved, the assessment progressed.  To
    the parties’ credit, they agreed to be bound by the assessor’s recommendations.  On
    <st1:date Year="2004" Day="20" Month="5"
w:st="on">
    May 20, 2004, Nelson J. made a final order, on consent, which incorporated
    the assessor’s recommendations.  This order included several provisions outlining
    the parties’ custody arrangement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    number of access issues remained outstanding.  On
    <st1:date Year="2005" Day="30" Month="3"
w:st="on">
    March 30, 2005, Weekes J. attempted to resolve these issues by appointing
    Dr. Morris as a parenting co-ordinator and granting him the authority to
    arbitrate make-up access issues that arose as a result of the father’s work
    schedule.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mother then commenced an action seeking an order to “set aside” the minutes
    of settlement and the order of Eberhard J. on the basis of fraud, non-disclosure,
    coercion and duress.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    <st1:date Year="2005" Day="7" Month="9"
w:st="on">
    September 7, 2005, Nelson J. concluded that the case had become “unsolvable” and “unmanageable” and
    ordered that the matter proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the commencement of trial, the father moved to have the issues specifically
    defined.  The trial judge ruled that neither party was making custody an
    issue and that the issues before her were access, child and spousal support,
    and contempt.  She expanded on the access component by holding that it included
    the parenting report and the order implementing it and possibly issues surrounding
    the parenting coordinator.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <h2>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge started her reasons by reviewing the history of the matter and
    making specific note of the high degree of conflict that had marked the parties’ efforts
    to address the consequences of their decision to separate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    keeping with her initial order identifying the issues in play, the trial
    judge set out the parties’ positions.  The father sought a new parenting
    coordinator to replace Dr. Morris.  The mother sought to vary the orders
    of Eberhard J. respecting support and Nelson J. respecting the parenting
    plan.  As well, the mother preferred that the parenting co-ordinator be replaced
    by strict access terms. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then made the clear finding, critical to the disposition of this
    appeal, that since Rachel’s birth the parties had been incapable of cooperating
    with one another in matters concerning Rachel’s upbringing.  She described
    the parties’ relationship at para. 8 of her judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is a very high level of animosity between
    the parties and virtually no trust between them throughout much of the time
    they have known each other.…. There is no evidence that the parties have
    made any real effort to ameliorate their differences or that they have any
    intention of doing so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge went on to hold, “[i]n these circumstances joint custody is out
    of the question.”  In support of this finding, the trial judge observed that
    the parties had been unable to make decisions together, communicate effectively
    with each other, or reduce the level of conflict. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge acknowledged that both parents love and are able to care
    for Rachel, she concluded, “[s]hared parenting to any significant extent
    is not possible in this [acrimonious] situation”.  She then decided that
    it was in Rachel’s best interests for the mother to have sole custody.  The
    trial judge selected the mother as sole custodian because she was more cooperative
    in terms of access arrangements, was the more experienced parent having already
    raised a child, and had a good ability to articulate her daughter’s needs
    to the father.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then concluded that Dr. Morris, despite his best efforts, was
    ineffectual as a parenting coordinator.  The trial judge further found that
    requiring the parties to cooperate with decisions of any parenting coordinator
    would only aggravate the parties’ already poor relationship.  As a result,
    the trial judge declared that the use of a parenting coordinator would have
    to end. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to access, the trial judge discussed the parties’ lack of trust and
    communication, and their corresponding inability to work around the father’s
    work schedule.  The trial judge then outlined a new access schedule, which
    included provisions on issues such as make-up time, access on holidays and
    other special occasions, and how the parties were to pick up and drop off
    Rachel.  The access schedule also included changes for when Rachel grew older. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge therefore awarded custody of Rachel to the mother, dispensed
    with the parenting coordinator and made detailed access provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    then to the issue of support the trial judge did not accept the mother’s
    allegations of misrepresentation, duress, coercion or fraud.  Also, after
    describing the mother’s evidence as being of poor quality, scattered and
    not well presented, the trial judge found that the mother had not demonstrated
    a material change in circumstances.  Accordingly, the trial judge refused
    to set aside the support order of Eberhard J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the trial judge dealt with several ancillary matters.  First, the trial judge
    ordered the father to maintain a life insurance policy to be held in trust
    for Rachel.  Second, she fixed the parties’ s. 7 expenses and apportioned
    responsibility for these expenses at 75% to the father and 25% to the mother.  Third,
    the trial judge dismissed the mother’s motion for contempt but granted the
    restraining order the mother had requested.  The trial judge reasoned that
    without a restraining order there would be a risk of escalating hostility
    between the parties that could result in physical harm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the issue of costs, the trial judge determined that there was “mixed” success
    and therefore declined to make any order as to costs.</p>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p><u>(a) The Custody Appeal</u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is common ground that s. 17 of the <i>Divorce Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.),
    c. 3  is the operative legislative provision.  It provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>17. (1)  A court of competent jurisdiction may make
    an order varying, rescinding or suspending, prospectively or retroactively,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) a support order or any provision thereof on
    application by either or both former spouses; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) a custody order or any provision thereof on
    application by either or both former spouses or by any other person.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> (4.1)  Before the court makes a variation order
    in respect of a spousal support order, the court shall satisfy itself that
    a change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of either
    former spouse has occurred since the making of the spousal support order
    or the last variation order made in respect of that order, and, in making
    the variation order, the court shall take that change into consideration.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(5)  Before the court makes a variation order in
    respect of a custody order, the court shall satisfy itself that there has
    been a change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of the
    child of the marriage occurring since the making of the custody order or
    the last variation order made in respect of that order, as the case may be,
    and, in making the variation order, the court shall take into consideration
    only the best interests of the child as determined by reference to that change.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    pivotal point the father raises is that the trial judge’s jurisdiction to
    interfere with a final order pertaining to custody must be grounded on a
    finding that there has been a material change of circumstances between the
    time the previous order was made and trial.  According to the father, the
    trial judge made no such finding, nor was any such finding available to her
    on the evidence; as such, her order cannot stand.  I agree. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Gordon
      v.</i> <i>Goertz,</i> [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 at para. 10, the Supreme Court
      held that before a court can consider the merits of an application for
      variation, it must be satisfied that there has been a material change in
      circumstances since the last custody order was made.  To be more specific,
      McLachlin J. held at para. 13 that the trial judge must be satisfied of
      (1) a change in the condition, means, needs or circumstances of the child,
      (2) which materially affects the child, and (3) which was either not foreseen
      or could not have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the
      initial order.  If the applicant is unable to meet this threshold requirement,
      the inquiry can go no further. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties do not dispute that the trial judge was required to find a material
    change in circumstance before she could vary Nelson J.’s custody order.  What
    is in dispute is whether the trial judge made that critical finding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    father submits that while the transcript reveals that the trial judge was
    clearly aware of the law in this respect, the fact that her reasons are silent
    on the issue demonstrates that she failed to apply the law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mother submits that a finding of a material change in circumstance is implicit
    in the trial judge’s reasoning.  According to the mother, the trial judge’s
    finding is grounded on the inability of the parents to avoid conflict in
    their dealings with each other in issues pertaining to Rachel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    transcripts of the trial clearly demonstrate that the trial judge was aware
    that the mother had to establish a material change in Rachel’s circumstances
    before the issue of custody could be re-opened.  In addition to numerous
    other references, the trial judge counselled the parties that she had to
    find, “not just any change; a material change that happened after the date
    of the Final Order such that this court should therefore intervene and make
    a change.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    problem is her reasons make no mention of this threshold issue.  This omission
    is in contrast to that part of her reasons pertaining to the mother’s application
    to vary the father’s support obligations where the trial judge explicitly
    finds that the mother failed to satisfy her that there had been a material
    change in circumstances. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    counter the father’s argument that the trial judge erred in failing to deal
    with the threshold issue necessary to re-open matters pertaining to Rachel’s
    custody, the mother contends that a finding of a material change in circumstances
    is implicit in the trial judge’s repeated references to the acrimony between
    the parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a specific example, the mother argues that the parties’ agreement to submit
    to parenting coordination was made with the expectation that the parenting
    coordinator would reduce the conflict between them.  She contends that the
    continued and escalating conflict that undermined the parenting coordinator
    constituted a change in the parties’ ability to meet Rachel’s needs that
    could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time the parenting coordinator
    was agreed upon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    support her argument, the mother cites <i>Griffin v. Bootsma, </i>[2004]
    O.J. No. 2781 (S.C.J.), where the parents’ chronic difficulties in resolving
    parenting issues were found to amount to a material change in circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Griffin</i>, however, the trial judge held that the parties could not
    have anticipated the conflict at the time they settled their custody dispute.  The
    subsequent turn of events, their turning into a “high-conflict couple”, was
    therefore a “change” that was not foreseen according to the words of McLachlin
    J. in <i>Gordon</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    is anything but the case here. According to the trial judge, “since the birth
    of their child, the parties have been altogether incapable of cooperating
    with one another in order to raise Rachel”. This finding is well supported
    by the evidence.  The parties’ willingness to work through a parenting coordinator
    does not detract from that finding; rather it reinforces it, given one was
    necessary to begin with and given this regime quickly deteriorated and proved
    unworkable. It follows that, unlike in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Griffin</i><i>,</i> the conflict between the parties did not constitute
    either a change or a situation that could not have been foreseen by them
    at the time of Nelson J.’s order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the threshold issue was not established, the trial judge had no jurisdiction
    to vary the custody order of Nelson J.; therefore, the order granting custody
    of Rachel to the mother must be set aside.</p>

'><u>(b) The Support Cross-Appeal </u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mother raises three issues in the cross-appeal.  She contends that the trial
    judge erred in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>failing
    to find that the father was in arrears in child support ($675);</li>
    <li>failing
      to address properly the issue of Rachel’s day care needs in considering
    the s. 7 expenses; and,</li>
    <li>failing
      to find a material change of circumstances so as to re-open the issue of
      spousal support. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the mother’s claim for arrears, the trial judge observed that
    the Family Responsibility Office had looked into the matter and determined
    that an adjustment to the amount of child support the father was paying was
    warranted and that at the time of trial he was not in arrears.  I see no
    reason to interfere with that finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s treatment of the s.
    7 expenses.  The trial judge carefully examined the evidence of Rachel’s
    childcare costs and, relying on the mother’s evidence, concluded that not
    all of the costs were incurred as a result of the mother’s work or education
    demands.  Then, based on the evidence before her, the trial judge reasonably
    fixed the allowable childcare expenses and apportioned those costs in relation
    to the parties’ respective incomes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I cannot accept the mother’s submission that the trial judge erred in finding
    that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that there
    had been  a material change in circumstances justifying a variation of the
    father’s spousal support obligations.  According to the mother, the trial
    judge should have found a material change in circumstances based on the mother’s
    changed financial circumstances due to both her role as primary care-giver
    and the parties’ acrimonious relationship.  The trial judge, however, found
    that there was insufficient evidence of a change in the mother’s financial
    circumstances –
    a finding deserving of deference absent an obvious error. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if the evidence supported the mother’s submission that there was a change
    in her financial circumstances, the causes of that change would not amount
    to a material change of circumstances as contemplated in <i>Gordon</i>, <i>supra</i>.  I
    refer back to my reasons regarding the mother’s failure to establish a material
    change in circumstances sufficient to re-open custody: conflict between the
    parties was, regrettably, the norm.  As well, the mother’s role as primary
    caregiver was obviously foreseeable at the time of Eberhard J.’s order, dated
    approximately six months after Rachel’s birth. </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear that the parties’ relationship has been relentlessly acrimonious
    and conflictual since young Rachel’s birth.  The fact that there has been
    no change in this sad state of affairs is what grounds my conclusion that
    the trial judge erred in re-opening the custody issue and did not err in
    deciding not to re-open the financial matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    person occupying the most unfortunate position throughout this conflict is,
    of course, Rachel herself.  Regrettably, she has known no other state of
    affairs.  For her sake, I would encourage the parties to pursue and resolve
    their disputes in a more amicable fashion.</p>
  <h2>Costs and Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the judge awarded no costs on the grounds that success was “mixed”.  The
    father sought leave to appeal this award.  Given the disposition of the appeal
    and cross-appeal, the parties’
    submissions on this issue are no longer relevant; however, it can no longer
    be said that success was “mixed”.  Rather, the father has been substantially
    successful and he should be entitled to costs.  In the circumstances of this
    case, an award for the costs of the trial of $15,000, including interest
    and Goods and Services Tax, is appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also award the father his costs of this appeal and cross-appeal fixed
    in the amount of $10,000 including interest and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order below granting
    sole custody of Rachel to the mother.  The order of Nelson J. is restored.  Given
    the difficulties the parties have had in working with Dr. Morris, the issue
    of who will be the parenting coordinator may need to be re-visited.  If the
    parties are unable to agree, the selection of the new parenting coordinator
    shall be dealt with by way of a motion to the Superior Court.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span

    would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
