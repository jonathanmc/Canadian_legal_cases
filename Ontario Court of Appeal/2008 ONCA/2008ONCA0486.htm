    a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual assault,
    one count of sexual interference and one count of sexual exploitation for
    acts involving his niece.  The convictions were for incidents that occurred
    while the complainant was between approximately twelve and sixteen years
    of age.  The appellant was sentenced to three years in prison, less two months
    credit for pre-trial custody.  He appeals from conviction and seeks leave
    to appeal sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

    Crown led the evidence of the complainant, GS; Ms. Adshade, a Catholic Children’s
    Aid Society (CCAS) worker to whom the appellant made substantial admissions
    about the matters in question; and that of Constable Monk, a police officer
    to whom the appellant also made admissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify and no evidence was led on his behalf.  The defence
    consisted largely of attacking the complainant’s evidence on the basis of
    her continued consensual contact with the appellant over the years and the
    fact that disclosure of the allegations occurred at a time when the complainant
    and her family had bad feelings toward the appellant because he had broken
    up his marriage to the complainant’s Aunt R.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US><i>The

    was 20 years of age at the time of trial.  She was born in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
    and lived there until she was ten years old, at which time she moved with
    her family to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant was married to her mother’s sister, R.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1996, when the complainant was about twelve years old, the appellant and
    his son D. moved from the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  At that time, the two families began to share a two-bedroom condominium
    owned by the complainant’s parents.  The complainant and her parents shared
    one bedroom; the appellant and D. shared the other.  R. lived at the home
    of her employer but would return to the condominium on the weekends. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that her father would leave the condominium early in
    the morning to drive her mother to work.  The complainant would remain in
    the condominium in the bedroom that she shared with her parents.  The appellant
    would be home in the condominium because he worked the afternoon or evening
    shift.  He would go into the bedroom where the complainant was, close the
    door, turn on loud music and take the complainant’s clothing off.  He would
    put one hand over her mouth and use the other to touch her breasts and then
    penetrate her digitally. The appellant would pull his shorts halfway down,
    get on top of her and the complainant would feel something going inside of
    her.  Afterwards, as he put her clothes back on, the complainant would cry
    and the appellant would tell her to not tell anyone what had happened.  He
    would also tell her that no one would believe her, it would ruin the family
    and R. would never speak to her again.  At some point, the appellant also
    threatened to hurt R.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that the appellant sexually abused her 3-4 times a
    month during the one and a half year period that the two families lived in
    the shared condominium.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appellant and his family moved to another unit in the same building,
    the appellant would sexually abuse the complainant when she was at his home
    babysitting D.  The abuse followed the same pattern as that which occurred
    when the two families lived together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, the complainant and her family moved into a house and she no longer
    babysat D.  The complainant testified to a further single sexual assault
    by the appellant in the summer of 2000.  While home alone one day, GS heard
    someone knocking at the door.  She looked outside and saw the appellant,
    who said he needed something from the house.  She let him in.  In the course
    of conversation, the appellant told her she should learn how to masturbate.  He
    then began to masturbate in front of her.  After that, he went behind the
    complainant, put his hand on her mouth and began to rub her shoulder and
    stomach.  When he attempted to touch her breast area, she went to the kitchen
    and got a knife.  She told the appellant to leave or she would tell everyone
    or call 911.  The appellant then left.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a contested <i>voir dire, </i>the complainant was permitted to testify also
    about the sexual abuse she had experienced at the hands of the appellant
    when she lived in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
    .  The admissibility of that evidence is not questioned on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant further testified that, in the summer of 2002 after the appellant
    and R. had separated, she told her family what the appellant had done.  The
    Crown then asked the complainant if she had ever before told anyone about
    the appellant’s actions.  The complainant replied that she had told her friend
    C. in 1996 and her friend L. at the end of grade eight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel objected, saying she was unsure of the admissibility of the evidence
    that GS had told her friends previously about the abuse and that in pre-trial
    discussions, the Crown had indicated she would not lead L. and C.’s evidence
    through the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel replied that she had undertaken to not elicit, from the complainant,
    details of the statements.  However, her undertaking did not extend to the
    fact the complainant had made the statements.  She explained that she wanted
    the evidence before the jury in case the complainant was cross-examined on
    delayed disclosure, in which event she could call the friends as witnesses
    to confirm that the statements had been made and to rebut any suggestion
    that the complainant had fabricated her evidence about having made the prior
    statements to her friends.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that the fact of disclosure to the friends was something
    that could be led in chief but without the details of what had been disclosed: “it’s
    the details that might be perceived to lend some sort of credibility as a
    prior consistent statement, but you can certainly say who you might have
    told.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination, defence counsel elicited evidence from the complainant
    that the break-up between the appellant and R. was “bad”
    because the appellant had caught R. cheating on him, R. was in court on the
    day of trial, the complainant was still very close to R., and the complainant’s
    family did not want R. to get back together with the appellant.  In respect
    of the timing of the disclosure to the complainant’s family, trial counsel
    also elicited that disclosure took place at the home of the complainant’s
    Aunt C. and that Aunt C. called the Children’s Aid Society when the appellant
    found out that R. was cheating on him.   </p>

    addition to the complainant’s evidence, the Crown tendered the evidence of
    Lori Adshade, an intake worker at the CCAS.  Ms. Adshade testified about
    admissions the appellant made when confronted with allegations that he had
    sexually abused the complainant.  Ms. Adshade’s testimony on the admissions
    was held admissible following a contested <i>voir dire</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On

    Mina had been working with the appellant and his family on an unrelated matter

    and alleged that the appellant had been sexually assaulting her since she
    was a young child.  Ms. Mina explained that these allegations were included
    in the document that she was to serve on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant arrived for his meeting with Ms. Mina, Ms. Mina told him that
    she had received allegations that the appellant had been sexually abusing
    his niece.  She also told him the police had been contacted about the allegations
    and that he was not to have any contact with his family.  According to Ms.
    Adshade, the appellant became visibly upset and was
    “sort of crying”.  He said he did not think his family would forgive him
    now that they knew “about what happened with” the complainant and that he
    had a “horrible problem” but had been praying to God for help.  He admitted
    touching the complainant but denied having intercourse with her.  He described
    that “sometimes it happened at her home when she was there alone”.  The appellant
    then became very emotional and said he had been thinking about committing
    suicide and that having his own daughter had made him feel guilty
    “about what he had been doing” to the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Adshade was concerned about the appellant’s threats of suicide so she left
    the meeting and called 911.  When she returned to the meeting, the appellant
    said he had never asked the complainant not to tell anyone what was happening
    nor had he threatened her.  He also said he wanted a second chance with his
    family and that he was willing to move back into the house and look after
    the children and let his wife get a job.  Ms. Adshade testified that she
    told the appellant that “under no circumstances would [they] consider it
    safe for him to be at home with his children” and that she thought he needed “quite
    a lot of help” before that could happen.  The police then arrived.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Monk was one of the police officers who arrived at the CCAS offices as a
    result of the 911 call.  According to Constable Monk, immediately on his
    arrival into the interview room where the appellant sat, the appellant said, “Sorry
    for touching my niece.”  Constable Monk then cautioned the appellant who
    replied, “I want to go to the hospital.  I don’t want to live.”  The appellant
    was then arrested for sexual assault and given his right to counsel.  </p>

    defence objected to the evidence given by Ms. Adstade of the circumstances
    in which the statements had been made, resulting from the appellant having
    been involved with the CCAS on an “unrelated matter”.  The impugned evidence
    is set out below but, for convenience sake, it will be referred to as the “discreditable
    conduct evidence”.  A mistrial was requested on the basis that the discreditable
    conduct evidence was prejudicial and amounted to expert evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the application.  He began by rejecting the notion
    that Ms. Adshade was reading from her will say statement, stating that he
    was not convinced that she was simply regurgitating or parroting the statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    he rejected the submission that he ought to instruct the jury that if the
    jury thought Ms. Adshade had given opinion evidence, they should ignore the
    evidence.  The trial judge was not of the view that Ms. Adshade had given
    inadmissible opinion evidence.  He noted that the impugned testimony was
    simply Ms. Adshade’s lay observations, that anyone could have offered the
    same opinions, that there was no need for special qualifications or experience
    in order to form such observations, and that Ms. Adshade had not been qualified
    as an expert.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the discreditable conduct evidence, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As for mentioning the family and to use [defence
    counsel’s] expression “intertwining” that information with the other, there
    had to be some reason, some plausible reason given to the jury for calling
    him in [to the CCAS offices].  The witness is bound to tell not only the
    truth but the whole truth, so she had to give the other reason [sic] which
    was done as inoffensively as possible by saying that it was to give him some
    papers in an unrelated matter. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am of the view that none of that has prejudiced
    the accused in any way.  It is, of course, always possible that this Court
    could give a warning to the jury with respect to those matters which defence
    counsel found objectionable, but I rather think that any warning would simply
    highlight the matter in the jury’s mind … .</p>

    the trial judge erred in: (1) admitting the discreditable conduct evidence
    and in failing to provide the jury with a limiting instruction on the proper
    use of that evidence; and (2) admitting the complainant’s evidence that she
    told her two friends of the abuse and incorrectly instructing the jury on
    the proper use to be made of that evidence and the disclosure by the complainant
    to her family (the “prior consistent statements”).</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges that the trial judge admitted evidence of discreditable
    conduct when he permitted Ms. Adshade to testify that: </p>

      a lot of help before he could resume living with his children.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    analysis of this ground of appeal must begin with the observation that the
    appellant does not question the admissibility of the substantial admissions
    made by the appellant, as recounted by Ms. Adshade, when confronted with
    the allegations of abuse.  Counsel takes issue only with some of the evidence
    that was adduced in Ms. Adshade’s recounting of those admissions and not
    with the admissions themselves.  Nor does counsel for the appellant challenge
    the admissibility of Constable Monk’s evidence which, again, amounted to
    a confession by the appellant that he had been sexually abusing the complainant.  In
    light of those admissions, I find it hard to conceive of how the impugned
    evidence could be prejudicial.
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the impugned evidence amounts to discreditable conduct, there was no error
    in admitting it.  Evidence of discreditable conduct may be admissible where
    it provides narrative required to provide some context to the evidence directly
    relevant to the charges before the court and the probative value of the impugned
    evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, it was essential that some evidence of the circumstances
    in which the admissions were made was before the jury in order for the jury
    to determine what weight it should give to those admissions.  I draw from
    the jurisprudence on confessions in so concluding.  In deciding what weight,
    if any, to attach to a confession, the jury must be told to take into consideration
    all the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the making of the confession.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Similarly, the discreditable conduct evidence
    was necessary to give the jury the circumstances in which the admissions
    were made so that it could determine the reliability of such admissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of the assessment of prejudicial versus probative value of the impugned
    evidence, I begin by noting that the Crown took reasonable steps to adduce
    only sufficient narrative to provide context as to how the admissions came
    to be made.  The involvement of the appellant with the CCAS was referred
    to only as an
    “unrelated matter” and no evidence was led to suggest the nature of that
    matter.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    and most significantly, any prejudicial effect the impugned evidence might
    have had was greatly outweighed by the overwhelming probative value of the
    confession. The jury could hardly be concerned with an unspecified “unrelated
    matter” when that skeletal piece of contextual evidence was juxtaposed with
    nothing less than the appellant’s admission that he
    “touched” the complainant while denying he had intercourse with her, sometimes
    the touching occurred while she was at her home alone, he had a “horrible
    problem”, and he felt guilty about what he had been doing to the complainant.  In
    addition, shortly thereafter through Constable Monk’s evidence, the jury
    heard evidence of the further admission by the appellant that he was “sorry
    for touching my niece”.  And, from the complainant’s evidence which preceded
    that of Ms. Adshade, the jury had heard evidence that the appellant had sexually
    abused the complainant when she was a young child living in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">

    . </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, it is fanciful to imagine that the jury would have become
    preoccupied with speculating about the “unrelated matter” when, in short
    order, the witness testified that the conversation resulted in the appellant
    confessing to the offences before the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the submission that the charge was deficient as it failed to give
    a limiting instruction on the discreditable conduct evidence, this court
    has held that such an instruction is not necessary in every case.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  This is one such case, as there were good reasons
    for not giving a limiting instruction.  As previously noted, the prejudicial
    effect of the evidence was low as no information about the “unrelated matter” was
    disclosed.  The impugned evidence of the surrounding circumstances had significant
    probative value because it provided the jury with a context in which to determine
    the weight to be given to the admissions.  And, importantly, giving a limiting
    instruction would not have operated in the appellant’s interest as it would
    have drawn attention to the fact that the appellant was involved with the
    CCAS on an “unrelated matter”.  As the trial judge stated when dismissing
    the mistrial application based on the impugned evidence, “any warning would
    simply highlight the matter in the jury’s mind”.  Finally, the trial judge
    did instruct the jury in general terms that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You must not speculate, however, about what evidence
    there might have been or permit yourselves to guess or make up theories without
    evidence to support them.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                   …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would not be fair to discuss this case on the
    basis of information not adduced or tested by the parties in court and made
    part of the evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    a general rule, prior consistent statements of a witness are inadmissible.  There
    are two primary justifications for the exclusion of such statements: first,
    they lack probative value and second, they constitute hearsay when adduced
    for the truth of their contents:  <i>R. v. Dinardo</i>, 2008 SCC 24 at para.
    36.  However, the fact of a prior complaint may be admissible under the narrative
    exception to the general rule.  See <i>Dinardo </i>at para. 37; <i>R. v.</i> <i>F.

    fact that the statements were made is admissible because it assists the jury
    in understanding the sequence of events from the alleged offence to the prosecution.  That
    is, it enables the jurors to understand how the complainant’s story was disclosed
    and how the matter came to the attention of the proper authorities.  The
    Crown can adduce narrative evidence in its case in chief, regardless of whether
    the defence has raised the issue of recent fabrication or the timing of the
    complaint.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, there are two prior consistent statements that must be
    considered:  the first is the complainant’s disclosure to her family in 2002
    and the second is her disclosure that told her friends, L. and C, of the
    abuse before she told her family what had taken place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the appellant concedes that the complainant’s disclosure to her family was
    admissible narrative evidence, nothing needs to be said about those prior
    consistent statements in terms of admissibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the complainant’s evidence that she told her friends L. and C.
    about the appellant’s conduct in 1996 and 1998, respectively, it is my view
    that was also permissible narrative evidence.  No details of the content
    of the statements to her friends was led.  The complainant explained that
    she had difficulty telling her family about the assaults because she did
    not think her family would believe her and because the appellant had threatened
    to hurt R. if she disclosed his conduct.  The fact of her disclosure to persons
    outside of her family fits with the narrative of her explanation for the
    difficulties in coming forward with the allegations and assists in filling
    in the gap between the assaults and disclosure to the authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn next to the appellant’s submission that the charge to the jury was deficient
    in respect of the prior consistent statements.  The alleged errors are two-fold.  First,
    it is said that the trial judge erred in telling the jury it could use the
    evidence of disclosure to the complainant’s family to assist in assessing
    her credibility as a witness.  Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in failing to give an instruction limiting the use the jury could
    make of the disclosures to the complainant’s family and friends.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of complaint is based on the following part of the trial judge’s
    instruction to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Gentlemen, [the complainant] told you of the circumstances
    surrounding the time when she revealed to her mother that the inappropriate
    conduct on the part of Mr. B. had taken place.  You can use that evidence
    if you wish to – we call it “disclosure” or “reporting” – to assist you in
    assessing her credibility as a witness.  In doing so, please note that as
    a matter of law, it cannot be said that a complainant who is wronged will
    always complain at the first opportunity.  In fact, there is no rule how
    victims of sexual abuse will behave.  Reactions vary.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding whether the complainant, Ms. S., acted
    after the incident in a manner consistent with her story, you should consider
    such factors as her state of mind at the time, her age and level of maturity,
    her sense of composure and confidence, the relationship which existed between
    her and Mr. B. and the relationship between her and her mother in the context
    of their cultural rules.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You will recall that Ms. S. told us that she felt
    closer to her Aunt R., Mr. B.’s wife, than she did to her own mother, although
    she felt close to her mother.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. S. also testified that Mr. B. had told her
    not to tell anyone and that if she did, no one would believe her, that it
    would ruin the whole family and that her Aunt R. would never speak to her
    again.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She said that it was in the summer of the year
    2002, when she first disclosed to the family in circumstances when she learned
    that Mr. B. had been telling family members that she was touching herself
    sexually.  She said that she had previously told her two best friends, C.
    and L., as long ago as 1996. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dinardo </i>at
    paras. 37 – 38, Charron J., writing for the Court, explains:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Once admitted, the [prior consistent] statements
    may be used for the limited purpose of helping the trier of fact to understand
    how the complainant’s story was initially disclosed.  The challenge is to
    distinguish between
    “using the narrative evidence for the impermissible purpose of confirming
    the truthfulness of the sworn allegation” and “using narrative evidence for
    the permissible purpose of showing the fact and timing of a complaint, which
    may then <i>assist the trier of fact in the assessment </i>of the truthfulness
    or credibility”.  [Emphasis in original.]  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>R. v. G.C.</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2245 (QL),
    the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that the prior consistent statements of
    a complainant may assist the court in assessing the complainant’s likely
    truthfulness, particularly in cases involving allegations of sexual assault
    against children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    at para. 12 of <i>R. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Stirling</i>, 2009 SCC 10, Bastarache J. writing for a unanimous court, states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is therefore not entirely accurate to submit,
    as the appellant contends, that prior consistent statements cannot be used
    to
    “bolster” or “support” the credibility of a witness generally.  This argument
    attempts to insulate the impact of the prior consistent statements from the
    remainder of the credibility analysis and suggests that “general” credibility
    can somehow be hived off from the specific credibility question to which
    the statements relate.  Such a fine parsing of the notion of credibility
    is impractical and artificial.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impugned instruction does not suggest that the jury could use the disclosure
    to the complainant’s family for the impermissible purpose of confirming the
    truthfulness of her allegations.  Rather, it conveyed to the jury the notion
    that the narrative evidence could be used for the permissible purpose of
    showing the fact and timing of the complaint which might then assist the
    jury in its assessment of the truthfulness or credibility of the complainant.  Accordingly,
    I see no error in the instruction that was given on the statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the second alleged error in relation to these statements, namely,
    that the trial judge erred in failing to give an instruction limiting the
    use the jury could make of the disclosures.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the fact of a prior complaint is admitted as part of the narrative, the trial
    judge is generally obliged to give a limiting instruction indicating that
    the prior complaints are not admitted for the truth of their contents and
    that the jury is to consider only the fact that the complaints were made
    to assist them in understanding what occurred and why:  <i>R. v. F. (J.E.),
    supra</i>, at 475. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as this court held in <i>R. v. Demetrius </i>(2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 26 at
    paras. 21-22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although limiting instructions are generally required
    in cases involving prior consistent statements, there are circumstances where
    a limiting instruction may not be required.  The adequacy of a trial judge’s
    instructions must be assessed in the context of the particular case on a
    functional basis.  In my view, a limiting instruction regarding the use to
    be made of the prior consistent statement was unnecessary in this case and,
    indeed, as the defence was relying on the prior statement to support its
    theory, a limiting instruction might well have been confusing.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has been held by this court that the usual limiting
    instruction regarding a prior consistent statement may not be necessary where
    the defence itself relies on the prior statement, where it was clear to the
    jury that the prior statement was not offered as proof of the underlying
    facts, or where the concern about self-corroboration is simply not present.

    accept the Crown’s contention that a limiting instruction was not required
    in this case because of defence counsel’s use of the prior consistent statements
    at trial.  The thrust of the defence position was that the complainant fabricated
    the allegations in 2002 because of animus on her part and that of her family
    generated by the circumstances surrounding his break-up with R.  That is,
    the defence theory was that the complainant’s allegations were fabricated
    as part of the family’s collective retribution against the appellant.  Trial
    counsel used evidence elicited through cross-examination of the complainant,
    including that of the circumstances surrounding the complainant’s disclosure
    to her family, to establish a motive to fabricate.  The defence theory was
    apparent not only through the cross-examination of the complainant but also
    in defence counsel’s closing address to the jury.   The message conveyed
    in that closing was that the complainant had much consensual contact with
    the appellant over the years and the disclosure in 2002 was suspect because
    it came at a time when she had a motive to fabricate.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the jury charge on the prior consistent statements is considered together
    with the defence’s attack on the timing and circumstances of the disclosure
    of the allegations, in my view, a limiting instruction in relation to the
    disclosures was not required.  As explained in the above quoted extract from <i>Demetrius</i>,
    given the defence’s reliance on the prior statements to the complainant’s
    family to support its theory, a limiting instruction was not only unnecessary
    it may have been confusing.  The fact that trial counsel did not request
    the limiting instruction proposed on appeal lends support to my view that
    there was no danger of impermissible reasoning in the circumstances of this
    case.</p>

    the time of sentencing, the appellant was thirty-six years of age.  He had
    no prior criminal record and had been gainfully employed since 1997.  Although
    the appellant and his wife were divorced, the appellant paid child support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred by treating the appellant’s
    absence of insight into the effect of the offences on the complainant as
    an aggravating feature and by sentencing for events not proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  The appellant asks that the sentence be reduced to time served. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis on which to interfere with the sentence.  The sentence was not
    manifestly unfit nor did the trial judge err in principle, fail to consider
    a relevant factor or overemphasize an appropriate factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has repeatedly and consistently upheld upper reformatory to low penitentiary
    sentences in cases of sexual abuse by a person in a position of trust.  In
    the recent case of <i>R. v. G.A.G </i>(2006), 206 O.A.C. 134, this court
    upheld a sentence of four and a half years imposed on a man for the sexual
    assault and sexual touching of his son.  At para. 13, the court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A sentence of four years and six months was not
    manifestly unfit.  The assaults against the appellant’s son continued over
    many years.  The assaults progressed in gravity from fondling to mutual masturbation
    and fellatio, involved a serious abuse of parental authority and had a serious
    impact upon the victim.  We agree with the respondent that they fell within
    the 3 to 5 year range identified in <i>R. v. B.(J.) </i> (1990), 36 O.A.C.
    307 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the sexual assaults continued over a number of years, during
    a period when the complainant was a young and vulnerable child.  The assaults
    involved digital penetration and were a serious abuse of the appellant’s
    position of trust.  He was a mature adult who exploited the trust that the
    complainant and her family placed in him, perpetrating sexual assaults in
    the period that he and his son were permitted to reside in the family home
    and when the complainant babysat his child.  The assaults had a devastating
    psychological impact on the complainant and her parents.  Clearly, the sentence
    of three years was not manifestly unfit.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge made no error in considering the pre-sentence report in
    which the author stated that the appellant accepted limited responsibility
    for the offences, did not appear to appreciate their seriousness and showed
    little or no insight into the effects of his behaviour had on the complainant.  Lack
    of insight is a relevant factor in determining a fit sentence, both in relation
    to the need for specific deterrence and with respect to the prospect for
    rehabilitation.  While continued protestations of innocence are not to be
    treated as an aggravating factor (see <i>R. v. A.(K.) </i>(1999), 137 C.C.C.
    (3d) 554 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )), the sentencing judge did not use the appellant’s lack of insight as an
    aggravating factor.  Instead, as is apparent on a reading of the reasons
    for sentence as a whole, the sentencing judge considered lack of insight
    when determining a fit sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the sentencing judge was not obliged to treat the appellant’s admissions
    to Ms. Adshade in 2002, and his emotional state at that time, as indicative
    of insight on the appellant’s part as to the effects of his behaviour on
    the complainant.  The upset that the appellant displayed can be attributable
    to a number of things, including the prospect that the allegations were a
    further impediment to his being re-united with his family.  It is not necessarily
    equated with the appellant showing insight into the effects of his actions
    on the complainant.  Even if it could amount to some such evidence, the sentencing
    judge was entitled to prefer the information given by the author of the pre-sentence
    report that, at the time of sentencing, the appellant presented as having
    little such insight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the submission that the appellant was sentenced for events
    not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  I reject the appellant’s submission
    that he ought to have been sentenced only for three incidents of sexual abuse.  While
    the complainant’s evidence on count 4 related to a specific incident, her
    evidence on counts 1, 2 and 5 related to recurring abuse and not isolated
    incidents.  A finding of three separate incidents is inconsistent with the
    implications of the jury’s verdict. </p>
