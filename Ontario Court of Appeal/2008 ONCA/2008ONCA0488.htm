    for the appellant submits that the sentence is too long.  He contends that
    the pre-sentence report fell short of that which is required by <i>Gladue</i> because
    it did not fully set out the appellant’s circumstances and the relevant background
    factors.  As a result, it is argued, the sentencing judge dismissed the real
    and significant issues that the appellant faced and failed to consider all
    the relevant circumstances of the appellant as an aboriginal offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to tender, as fresh evidence, a more comprehensive <i>Gladue</i> report.  The
    Crown did not object to the panel reading the fresh evidence but argues that
    it does not meet the test for fresh evidence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p>[4]       The appellant and a group of others were drinking together when
    an argument developed and a fight broke out.  The appellant smashed a beer
    bottle over the head of Margaret Boyce, one of the people with whom she had
    been drinking.  The victim suffered severe lacerations to her face.  She
    was left alone after the assault.  As a result of a fire alarm being pulled,
    the police attended at the apartment in which the incident occurred and discovered
    the victim sitting in a pool of her own blood, unconscious and bleeding.  </p>
  <p>[5]       The victim’s injuries were severe, life-threatening and permanently
    disfiguring.  It took over 100 stitches during a three-hour operation to
    repair the lacerations to her head and face.  The victim also suffered a
    punctured eardrum and has ongoing problems with a twitching eye.  Damage
    to a tendon in the victim’s hand led to the loss of a nerve in two of her
    fingers and has resulted in restricted mobility of the hand.  The victim
    lost the feeling on the right side of her face.  She also suffers from chronic
    facial pain and headaches and significant facial scarring.  </p>
  <p><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p>[6]       After noting that all those involved in the incident, including
    the appellant, are aboriginal persons, the sentencing judge adjourned the
    sentencing proceedings and ordered that a pre-sentence report be prepared
    on a <i>Gladue</i> basis. [<i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688].  </p>
  <p>[7]       At the sentencing hearing, Crown and defence counsel were in agreement
    that, given the serious violent nature of the offence, denunciation would
    have to inform whatever sentence was imposed.  Defence counsel did not suggest
    that anything other than a period of incarceration would meet the needs of
    sentencing.  As the appellant is an alcoholic, he argued for a sentence of
    ten months as that would have allowed the appellant to complete a treatment
    program at the Algoma Treatment and Remand Centre in Sault Ste. Marie.  The
    Crown asked for a sentence in the range of eighteen months to two years less
    a day.  The appellant’s criminal record was also before the court.  It showed
    one conviction for assault and numerous breaches of probation and bail.       </p>
  <p>[8]       In <i>R. v. Kakekagamick </i>(2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 664, this court
    stressed the need for a pre-sentence report that adequately sets out the
    circumstances of the offender and the systemic and background factors that
    contributed to the aboriginal offender coming before the court.  We accept
    that the original pre-sentence report fell short of meeting those requirements.  </p>
  <p>[9]       For example, in the original pre-sentence report, there is a passing
    reference to the appellant having suffered a sexual assault as a youth.  The
    fresh evidence explains that when the appellant was 14 years old, she was
    at a party when her older sister started to physically assault her.  When
    that was stopped, the appellant went outside.  Another woman at the party
    asked if the appellant was all right.  She told the appellant to follow her
    and led her to another house a short distance away.  The woman left the appellant
    in the house and went back to the party.  The appellant was then gang-raped
    and warned not to tell anyone or her assailants would kill her family.  </p>
  <p>[10]     Further, the original report does not adequately indicate how the
    unsolved murder of the appellant’s common law spouse was related to the circumstances
    of life on her reserve.  Nor does it address the verbal and physical abuse
    the appellant received from other children on the Miskeegogamang First Nation,
    how that behaviour is related to the historic relationship between that First
    Nation and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Cat
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake, where the appellant was born and lived as a young child, and the effects
    on the appellant.  </p>
  <p>[11]     Accordingly, in order to properly decide the issues on appeal,
    we accept the need for the further evidence that has been tendered.  Having
    reviewed the further report, we find it helpful and necessary, given the
    information that is mandated by <i>Gladue</i>.  </p>
  <p>[12]     That said, we wish to note that it is evident -- both from the
    conduct of the sentencing hearing and the reasons for sentence - that the
    sentencing judge approached his task in a manner that was completely consistent
    with the principles enunciated in <i>Gladue</i> and the requirements of s.
    718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It would not have been apparent to
    the sentencing judge that the original pre-sentence report was deficient
    in that it failed to address adequately the appellant’s circumstances and
    background.     </p>
  <p>[13]     Nonetheless, we would not interfere with the sentence imposed as
    it is, in all the circumstances, fit and appropriate.  Given the serious
    violence of the offence and the extreme consequences to the victim, the sentence
    appropriately meets the need for denunciation and deterrence.  It falls at
    the lower end of the range appropriate in this case and reflects the full
    benefit of the mitigating factors, despite the fact that the sentencing judge
    had a less fulsome explanation of those factors than that provided to this
    court.   </p>
  <p><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p>[14]     Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
