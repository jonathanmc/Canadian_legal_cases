    breach related to K.W.G.’s failure to protect her daughter from recurrent
    sexual abuse perpetrated by K.W.G.’s husband – K.K.’s father – when K.K.
    was an adolescent.  The trial judge awarded K.K. damages of $230,000, comprised
    of $100,000 for general and aggravated damages, $100,000 for lost income
    and $30,000 for future care, plus prejudgment interest.  He also awarded
    K.K. her costs of the action on a partial indemnity basis.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1949, following their internment in a labour camp in the former Soviet Union,
    K.W.G. and her husband, P.G., immigrated to
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    with their daughter, K.K., who was then eight years old.  They settled in
    southwestern
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, obtaining work as farm labourers and sharegrowers on various tobacco
    farms.  Their second daughter, I.H., was born in October 1949.  The birth
    of two more daughters followed: R.G., born on May 5, 1951; and E.N., born
    on January 6, 1955.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    early years in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario were difficult ones for the family.  Work became the focus of their
    life.  The children assisted their parents with the tobacco farming.  A particularly
    heavy burden fell on K.K. – the eldest child.  She left school before completing
    her grade nine studies and began to work full time for her parents.  Eventually,
    P.G. and K.W.G. succeeded in purchasing their own farm and tobacco quota.  The
    acquisition of other farms followed in subsequent years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was evidence at trial that P.G. was often emotionally abusive towards his
    children, regularly yelling and swearing at them.  According to K.K., he
    was also physically abusive to her, on occasion hitting her in the head and
    kicking her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.G.’s
    abuse did not end there.  Commencing in about 1951, when K.K. was ten years
    old, P.G. repeatedly sexually abused K.K.  His abusive acts toward K.K. included
    fondling, digitally penetrating her vagina, rubbing his penis between her
    legs, forcing her to rub his penis, and ejaculating on her and her nightclothes.  The
    abuse did not stop until 1958, when K.K. turned seventeen and left home to
    marry S.K., another tobacco farmer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    their marriage, K.K. and her husband worked their own tobacco farm for a
    brief time, but then began to work as labourers or sharegrowers for K.K.’s
    parents.  With some interruptions for other employment opportunities, they
    continued to work for her parents for more than twenty years, living on a
    property that belonged to P.G. and K.W.G.  They also began their own family
    and had two sons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.G.
    and K.W.G. retired from active tobacco farming in the late 1970s.  For P.G.,
    retirement was short-lived.  He died of a heart attack in 1982 at 61 years
    of age.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    her parents’ retirement, K.K. worked in a factory, then as a school bus driver
    and, ultimately, as a supervisor at an apple farm.  Over the years, when
    her husband found work in various small towns in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, K.K. and her children relocated with him.  </p>
  <h2>(1)       Events Following P.G.’s Death </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.K.
    did not disclose her father’s sexual abuse to anyone prior to his death in
    1982.  She did not tell her mother or any of her siblings that P.G. had sexually
    abused her until the 1990s.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1991, nine years after P.G.’s death, K.K.’s younger sister, I.H., disclosed
    to some members of the family that she had a recalled memory of being sexually
    abused as a child by P.G.  On the trial judge’s findings, it was only after
    K.K. learned from her sister, E.N., of I.H.’s revelation of abuse that K.K.
    told E.N., in confidence, that she, too, had been sexually abused by P.G.  When
    I.H.’s disclosure of incest was met with incredulity by family members, E.N.
    felt compelled to breach her promise of confidentiality to K.K. and she revealed
    K.K.’s claim of sexual abuse to other family members, including K.W.G.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to K.K., after P.G.’s sexual abuse of her became known in the family, she
    experienced depression, anxiety, sleeplessness and panic attacks.  She was
    unable to perform her job and experienced recurrent nightmares, flashbacks
    of the abuse and heart irregularities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was also significant conflict in K.W.G.’s family, usually relating to money.  By
    the late 1990s, considerable tension had developed between K.K. and K.W.G.
    regarding K.W.G.’s treatment of K.K.’s family, and various resentments had
    grown up among K.K. and her sisters.    </p>
  <h2>(2)       The Litigation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sometime
    in the summer of 2000, K.K. consulted a lawyer and decided to sue K.W.G.  In
    September 2000, she disclosed P.G.’s sexual abuse to a physician and sought
    his referral to a sexual abuse counsellor.  She began counselling with a
    social worker in early October 2000.  Shortly thereafter, on October 26,
    2000, K.K. commenced an action against K.W.G. for damages for breach of fiduciary
    duty arising from K.W.G.’s failure to intervene to protect her from P.G.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    defended the action and denied that K.K. had been assaulted or abused by
    P.G. in any fashion.  She also denied knowledge of any sexually or physically
    abusive acts by her husband in respect of any of her children prior to his
    death.</p>
  <h2><i>K.K.’s position</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.K.
    maintained that her mother knew or ought to have known that P.G. was sexually
    abusing her.  Relying on the fact that the abuse usually occurred at night
    in her bedroom in the family home, when her mother was likely alone in the
    bed that she shared with P.G., K.K. argued that her mother must have known
    or turned a blind eye to P.G.’s frequent absences from their bedroom.  K.K.
    also asserted that K.W.G., who did the family’s laundry over the years, must
    have noticed semen stains on K.K.’s nightgown or bedclothes at some point
    during the course of about seven years of abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.K.
    also relied on two specific incidents in support of her claim that her mother
    was aware or should have been aware of P.G.’s sexual abuse.  The first incident
    occurred one night when K.K. fled to her mother’s bed after escaping from
    her father following a particularly aggressive sexual encounter.  Although
    her mother did not ask her why she had come to her bed, or inquire about
    P.G.’s whereabouts, K.K. believed that her mother either had knowledge of
    or willingly turned a blind eye to what had occurred.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second incident took place one night when the family was staying at the home
    of K.K.’s maternal grandmother.  According to K.K., her grandmother entered
    the room where K.K. had been forced to sleep between her parents, turned
    on the light and saw K.K.’s hand on her father’s penis (referred to by the
    parties as the
    “grandmother incident”).  The next day, K.K.’s grandmother allegedly confronted
    K.W.G. about the abuse.  K.K. said that when this confrontation occurred,
    she left her grandmother’s house, in shame, to walk the streets in the snow. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    grandmother incident assumed considerable importance at trial.  According
    to K.K., a meeting among K.W.G. and three of her daughters – E.N., R.G. and
    K.K. – took place sometime in 1993, during which K.K. confronted her mother
    with P.G.’s sexual abuse and raised the grandmother incident.  In their testimony
    at trial, E.N. and R.G. confirmed this aspect of K.K.’s testimony.  K.K.
    said that her mother recalled and acknowledged the grandmother incident,
    thus effectively admitting her husband’s abuse of K.K.  E.N. and R.G. denied
    this acknowledgement by their mother.</p>
  <h2><i>Defence position </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    was examined for discovery in October 2001.  On discovery, she vehemently
    denied that K.K. had been abused by P.G. in any manner.  She also denied
    that the grandmother incident ever occurred.  Importantly, contrary to the
    testimony of her daughters at trial, K.W.G. also said that she never discussed
    the grandmother incident with K.K. at any time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the time of trial in 2005, K.W.G. was legally incapacitated and unable to
    testify due to dementia.  As a result, her interests were represented by
    her daughter R.G. as litigation guardian.  K.K. was granted leave at trial
    to read-in K.W.G.’s discovery evidence as if it were her testimony at trial.  The
    trial judge also admitted a memoir written by K.W.G., in which K.W.G. described
    her life experiences.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    in her pleading and on discovery, K.W.G. denied that K.K. had been sexually
    abused by P.G.  However, shortly before trial, the defence conceded P.G.’s
    sexual abuse of K.K.  Nonetheless, the defence continued to assert that K.W.G.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Peter G. Jaffe, a clinical psychologist, testified on behalf of K.K.  He
    was accepted at trial as an expert on child sexual abuse and the effects
    of such abuse, including the “household dynamics and economic effects” of
    such abuse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on psychological testing of K.K., Dr. Jaffe offered the opinion that K.K.
    suffers from significant tension, unhappiness, pessimism, depression, anxiety
    and stress to a degree that places her at risk of self-harm.  He described
    the impact of K.K.’s sexual, physical, verbal and emotional abuse as
    “extensive” and stated that her resulting “lack of self-esteem and self-worth
    has impaired her functioning in all areas of her life”, including her marriage,
    education, employment and social activities.  In his opinion, it was “highly
    likely” that K.K.’s emotional difficulties are a result of the abuse.  He
    stated that K.K. suffers from “post-traumatic stress disorder with long-term
    symptoms of intrusive thoughts, as well as severe anxiety and depression” and
    that her traumatic memories relate to P.G.’s abuse of her.  </p>

    respect of K.W.G.’s conduct, Dr. Jaffe stated that K.K. was “physically and
    emotionally abandoned by her mother when she did not protect her”.  As a
    result, in his view, K.K. “experienced the loss of both parents at a very
    young age” and this
    “impacted on all relationships in her life and her own perception of herself
    as a parent”.  Dr. Jaffe concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The] fact that her mother did not protect her is
    responsible, not only for the extent of the abuse, but also for the many
    years that it continued.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The lack of validation of the abuse that she initially
    disclosed ten years ago has simply aggravated her symptoms and escalated
    the level of dysfunction in her life.</p>

    Phillip Klassen, a forensic psychiatrist, testified on behalf of K.W.G. on
    the psychiatric impact of sexual abuse on victims.  In contrast to Dr. Jaffe,
    however, the trial judge ruled that Dr. Klassen could not offer opinion evidence
    on the economic conse-quences of sexual abuse.  </p>

    his report dated September 8, 2005, Dr. Klassen outlined the results of his
    psychiatric assessment of K.K. and of psychological testing of her conducted
    by Dr. John Arrowood, a forensic psychologist, in conjunction with Dr. Klassen’s
    own work.  Dr. Klassen diagnosed K.K. as suffering from dysthymic and anxiety
    disorders, the latter consisting of a mixture of panic symptoms, “free floating
    anxiety and periodic post-traumatic symptoms”.  He offered the opinion that
    K.K. “might be expected to have experienced moderately severe negative consequences
    of the alleged sexual abuse” and that it was reasonable to suggest that the
    sexual abuse played a “significant” role in her psychological distress.  Overall,
    Dr. Klassen said, “[T]here is an identifiable negative outcome of the sexually
    assaultive behaviour … which is moderately severe in its scope and intensity.”</p>

    Klassen also indicated in his report that he was not positioned to comment
    on whether K.W.G. could, or should, have known about P.G.’s sexually assaultive
    behaviour; nor did he feel able to comment on whether K.W.G. “would have
    been able to deal, psychologically, with the notion that her daughter was
    being sexually assaulted by her husband”.</p>

    parties also led expert evidence on damages.  K.K.’s expert, Karen Dalton,
    a chartered accountant, testified as to the past and present value of K.K.’s
    lost income based on various quantification scenarios.  As well, Yvonne Pollard,
    a life care planning expert, prepared a future therapeutic needs report on
    behalf of K.K., estimating K.K.’s future care costs.  Errol Soriano, also
    a chartered accountant and a business valuator, was K.W.G.’s expert on damages. </p>

    found that she had not been prepared to intervene and that the evidence was
    insufficient to support a finding that she was unable to intervene to protect
    K.K.  He held that K.W.G. breached her fiduciary duty to K.K. “when she failed
    to protect [K.K.] from the physical and sexual abuse that she knew was being
    perpetrated by P.G.”.  Finally, he held that the doctrine of laches did not
    apply to bar K.K.’s claim for equitable relief.  </p>

    damages, $100,000 in damages for lost income from 1959 to 2005 (the first
    year of trial) and $30,000 in damages for future care, plus prejudgment interest.  He
    denied K.K.’s claim for punitive damages.  He also awarded K.K. her costs

    K.K.’s evidence, the last incident of sexual abuse occurred in 1958, 42 years
    before she commenced proceedings against her mother in 2000.  When K.K.’s
    action was initiated, the time for bringing a claim for breach of a fiduciary
    duty was not limited by statute in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Accordingly, no limitation period operated to bar K.K.’s action.  As
    a result, at trial, K.W.G. invoked the equitable doctrine of laches as a
    defence to K.K.’s claim that she breached her fiduciary duty by failing to
    intervene to protect K.K. from P.G.</p>

    Forest, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, accepted at p. 77
    the following description of the equitable doctrine of laches set out in
    R. Meagher, W.M.C. Gummow and J.R.F. Lehane, <i>Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies</i> (Sydney:
    Butterworths, 1984) at 755:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is a defence which requires that a defendant
    can success-fully resist an equitable (although not a legal) claim made against
    him if he can demonstrate that the plaintiff, by delaying the institution
    or prosecution of his case, has either (<i>a</i>) acquiesced in the defendant’s
    conduct or (<i>b</i>) caused the defendant to alter his position in reasonable
    reliance on the plaintiff’s acceptance of the status quo, or otherwise per-mitted
    a situation to arise which it would be unjust to disturb.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the considerable passage of time between P.G.’s last sexually abusive act
    and the commencement of K.K.’s action, it is important to underscore that
    mere delay, in itself, does not disentitle an applicant from equitable relief,
    even where the delay is extensive.  In <i>M.(K.)</i>, La Forest J. stated
    at pp. 77-78:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Thus there are two distinct branches to the laches
    doctrine, and either will suffice as a defence to a claim in equity.  What
    is immediately obvious from all of the authorities is that mere delay is
    insufficient to trigger laches under either of its two branches.  Rather,
    the doctrine considers whether the delay of the plaintiff constitutes acquiescence
    or results in circum-stances that make the prosecution of the action unreasonable.  Ultimately,
    laches must be resolved as a matter of justice as between the parties, as
    is the case with any equitable doctrine. </p>

    this case, K.W.G. argues that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the
    doctrine of laches in two respects: (i) under the first branch of the doctrine,
    the trial judge erred by concluding that acquiescence by K.K. had not been
    established; and (ii) the trial judge erred by failing to hold that, “as
    a matter of justice as between the parties”, the equitable relief claimed
    by K.K. should be denied.<a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    La Forest J.’s view, several considerations support this conclusion.  These
    include: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    fact that “many, if not most, of the damages flowing from incestuous abuse
    remain latent until the victim is well into adulthood” (at p. 31); </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“when
    the damages begin to become apparent, the causal connection between the incestuous
    activity and present psychological injuries is often unknown to the victim” (at

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>for
    many years, powerful social taboos surrounding sexual abuse “conspired with
    the perpetrators of incest to silence victims”
    and “maintain a veil of secrecy around the activity” (at p. 32); and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>also

      <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    in the context of equitable claims in an incest case – for example, where,
    as here, a breach of fiduciary obligation is alleged – <i>M.(K.)</i> holds
    that the fiduciary nature of the relationship between a parent and his or
    her child
    “supports a liberal application of the [delayed] discovery rule” (at p. 68).  The
    rationale for this approach flows from the essential character of a parent’s
    relationship to his or her child.  As La Forest J. put it in <i>M.(K.)</i> at
    pp. 61-62:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he relationship between parent and child is fiduciary
    in nature, and … the sexual assault of one’s child is a grievous breach of
    the obligations arising from that relationship.  Indeed, I can think of few
    cases that are clearer than this.  For obvious reasons society has imposed
    upon parents the obli-gation to care for, protect and rear their children.  The
    act of incest is a heinous violation of that obligation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently,
    in <i>K.L.B. v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 403, McLachlin C.J.,
    writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, explained the content of the
    parental fiduciary obligation in terms that stressed breach of trust (paras.
    48-49):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The traditional focus of breach of fiduciary duty
    is breach of trust, with the attendant emphasis on disloyalty and promotion
    of one’s own or others’ interests at the expense of the beneficiary’s interests.  Parents
    stand in a relationship of trust and owe fiduciary duties to their children.  <i>But
    the unique focus of the parental <u>fiduciary</u> duty, as distinguished
    from other duties imposed on them by the law, is breach of trust</i>. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have said that concern for the best interests
    of the child informs the parental fiduciary relationship, as La Forest J.
    noted in <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.), supra</i>, at p. 65.  But the duty imposed
    is to act loyally, and not to put one’s own or others’ interests ahead of
    the child’s in a manner that abuses the child’s trust. … The parent who exercises
    undue influence over the child in economic matters for his own gain has put
    his own interests ahead of the child’s, in a manner that abuses the child’s
    trust in him.  <i>The same may be said of the parent who uses a child for
    his sexual gratification or a parent who, wanting to avoid trouble for herself
    and her household, turns a blind eye to the abuse of a child by her spouse</i>.  The
    parent need not … be consciously motivated by a desire for profit or personal
    advantage; nor does it have to be her own interests, rather than those of
    a third party, that she puts ahead of the child’s.  <i>It is rather a question
    of disloyalty – of putting someone’s interests ahead of the child’s in a
    manner that abuses the child’s trust</i>.  Negligence, even aggravated negligence,
    will not ground parental fiduciary liability unless it is associated with
    breach of trust in this sense.  [Underlined emphasis in original; italicized

    my view, just as the delayed discovery rule should be liberally applied to
    avoid too ready a recognition of a limitation period defence in an incest
    case, so too should the courts be reluctant to allow a defendant in an incest
    case – including the ‘bystander’ parent – to escape liability for breach
    of fiduciary duty by invocation of the doctrine of laches.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    considerations identified by La Forest J. in <i>M.(K.)</i> as arguing against
    a “rigorous application” of a limitations statute in an incest case, listed
    above, apply with equal force to consideration of a laches defence in an
    incest case.  These considerations relate to the nature and effects of incest
    and sexual abuse.  The policy considerations germane to such offences apply
    whether a limitation period or a laches defence is raised.  Moreover, limitations
    statutes and laches defences are animated by
    “similar policy imperatives” and the requisite inquiries under both “very
    close[ly]” mirror each other.  <i>M.(K.)</i> at p. 79.  Finally, given the
    special character of the parental fiduciary duty and the especially “heinous” nature
    of the breach of trust and loyalty that incest represents, a strict application
    of the doctrine of laches in such cases is inappropriate.<a

    of laches in an incest case, whether claims are advanced against the abusive

    from this court: <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; <i>Stein
    v. The Ship
    “Kathy K”</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question of whether a plaintiff has acquiesced in the defendant’s conduct
    in an incest case is a fact-specific inquiry that depends on the circumstances
    of each case.  <i>M.(K.)</i> at p. 80.  Thus, the operation of the acquiescence
    branch of the doctrine of laches varies from situation to situation.  However,
    in <i>M.(K.)</i>, La Forest J. issued this clear warning: “particularly compelling
    evidence [is required] to demonstrate that an incest victim … ‘acquiesced’ in
    the sexual assaults made against her” (at p. 80).  Similarly, in my opinion,
    cogent and compelling evidence is required to establish that an incest victim
    acquiesced in the failure of a ‘bystander’ parent to intervene to protect
    the victim from the abusing parent’s wrongful conduct.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiff’s knowledge of her rights is the critical element in the acquiescence
    branch of the doctrine of laches.  As La Forest J. emphasized in <i>M.(K.)</i> at
    pp. 78-79:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>It is not enough that the plaintiff knows of
      the facts that support a claim in equity; she must also know that the facts
      give rise to that claim</i>.
    … However, this Court has held that knowledge of one’s claim is to be measured
    by an objective standard … [T]he question is whether it is reasonable for
    a plaintiff to be ignorant of her legal rights given her knowledge of the
    underlying facts relevant to a possible legal claim.  [Citations omitted

    Forest also offered this description of acquiescence: “[A]fter the deprivation

    delays.  This leads to an inference that her rights have been waived” (at

    was required in this case for a finding of acquiescence was proof of K.K.’s
    delay and, further, proof of her knowledge that K.W.G.’s failure to intervene
    to protect her gave rise to a claim against K.W.G.  Given that K.K.’s delay
    was manifest, the core question was whether it could reasonably be inferred
    that: (i) K.K. knew that her rights had been violated by her mother as well
    as by her father; (ii) K.K. also knew that her mother’s violation gave rise
    to a claim; and (iii) nonetheless, K.K. refrained from seeking redress against
    her mother.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, on the record before him, it was open to the trial judge to conclude
    that these inferences should not be drawn.  I say this for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge was alert to the centrality of the issue of K.K.’s knowledge
    in assessing K.W.G.’s laches defence.  As he correctly observed: “Knowledge
    is fundamental to the operation of both the common law discoverability doctrine
    and the determination of acquiescence in relation to an equitable claim.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge expressly considered and rejected K.W.G.’s contention that
    K.K., with full knowledge of her rights, delayed bringing suit until motivated
    to do so by a desire to seek retribution against her mother for conduct unrelated
    to P.G.’s sexual abuse, including the threat of disinheritance and other
    financial and family tensions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    so doing, the trial judge took into account K.K.’s denial of any improper
    motive, as well as the evidence of the many family conflicts and tensions
    that K.W.G. said formed the real basis for K.K.’s lawsuit.  He also noted
    the absence of any evidence that K.K. was aware, prior to the commencement
    of her action, that her mother had taken steps to alter the terms of her
    will.  Indeed, as the trial judge pointed out, it was K.K.’s evidence that
    she knew that her mother would likely take action to disinherit her <i>if</i> she
    commenced legal proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    considered this evidence, the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I suspect the conflict that preceded the commencement
    of this action may have made it easier for the plaintiff to summon the resolve
    to proceed, but I do not accept the defendant’s contention it was the reason.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Having reviewed the record, it is
    my view that this conclusion was available to the trial judge on the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judge accepted that K.K.’s only reason for commencing the litigation
    was “to force her mother to take some responsibility for what had happened”.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  At trial, when pressed for an explanation of
    the timing of her lawsuit, K.K. testified: “[I] was suffering a lot with
    the sexual abuse and I wanted my mother to realize exactly what I was going
    through.  It was – I wanted her to know what my pain and suffering was”.  K.K.
    expressly denied that her lawsuit was precipitated by any improper motive
    relating to disputes or conflicts with her mother or her sisters about matters
    unrelated to the sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    considered the entirety of the evidence, the trial judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>In my opinion, it cannot be reasonably inferred
      that the plaintiff acquiesced in the defendant’s conduct.</i>  After escaping
      from the abuse, the plaintiff coped with the pain and shame by remaining
      silent.  She had no reason to believe that disclosure after she left her
      parents’ home would result in her receiving any more support than she had
      received when the abuse was occurring.  Time and the broken confidence
      by [E.N.] eventually led to disclosure of the abuse, <i>but there was no
      acknowledgment of responsibility by the defendant and, in my view, never
      any acceptance by the plaintiff of her mother’s denial of knowledge.  I
      therefore, conclude that acquiescence is not demonstrated and the defence
      of laches is not established</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>M.(K.)</i>,
    when discussing the application of the discoverability rule to incest, La
    Forest J. commented at p. 35:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am satisfied that the weight of scientific evidence
    establishes that in most cases the victim of incest only comes to an awareness
    of the connection between fault and damage when she realizes who is truly
    responsible for her childhood abuse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in the context of a limitation period defence in an incest case, <i>M.(K.)</i> stresses
    that the question of when an incest victim became fully cognizant of
    “who bears the responsibility for her childhood abuse” is a pivotal consideration,
    for it is only “then that she realizes the nature of the wrong done to her” (at
    p. 45).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the trial judge was directing his attention to this factor when
    he said, “[T]here was no acknowledgment of responsibility by the defendant
    and, in my view, never any acceptance by the plaintiff of her mother’s denial
    of knowledge.”  Although the trial judge referred to K.K.’s lack of acceptance
    of K.W.G.’s “denial of knowledge” of the abuse, rather than to her lack of
    acceptance of K.W.G.’s failure to intervene in the face of the abuse, he
    also said: “[I]t cannot be reasonably inferred that the plaintiff acquiesced
    in the defendant’s conduct”.  I understand the trial judge to have concluded
    that when K.K. gained knowledge of her rights, she did not accept or condone
    her mother’s failure to protect her or her mother’s proffered explanation
    for that failure.  This was tantamount to a finding that K.K. never accepted,
    waived or forgave her mother’s breach of trust and violation of her rights.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    this critical finding is supported by the record.  Other than not commencing
    proceedings earlier, there was no evidence at trial that K.K. knowingly did
    anything to signal a waiver, release or abandonment of a claim against K.W.G.  Indeed,
    there is no indication on this record of knowledge by K.K. <i>at any time</i> prior
    to the summer of 2000 that she had a claim against her mother arising from
    her mother’s failure to intervene to protect her from P.G.  For instance,
    although the trial judge held that K.K. knew in 1993, as a result of the
    grandmother incident, “that her mother was aware of the abuse but was not
    prepared to intervene”, there is no evidence that K.K. also knew that she
    had a right to sue her mother because of this failure to intervene.  Nor
    is there any evidence of a decision by K.K. to refrain from suing K.W.G.,
    knowing that she had a claim against her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent
    such evidence, or evidence that it was unreasonable in the circumstances
    for K.K. to be unaware of a possible claim against K.W.G., it cannot be said
    that, by her conduct, K.K. waived, affirmed or released her mother’s breach
    of fiduciary duty so as to bar equitable relief on the ground of acquiescence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude, therefore, that this record falls short of affording what La Forest
    J. termed in <i>M.(K.)</i> the “particularly compelling evidence” that would
    be required to demonstrate that K.K. acquiesced in her mother’s failure to
    intervene to stop P.G.’s incestuous conduct.  </p>
  <h2><i>Justice as between the parties</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am also not persuaded that justice as between the parties compels the application
    of the doctrine of laches in this case.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    observe first, as the trial judge noted, that K.W.G.’s laches defence at
    trial rested solely on the first branch of the doctrine of laches – acquiescence.  K.W.G.
    did not argue at trial, as she does before this court, that “justice as between
    the parties” provides a discrete basis for the invocation of laches.  It
    is therefore not surprising that the trial judge’s reasons contain no explicit
    analysis of this issue.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not read <i>M.(K.)</i> as holding that the objective of achieving justice
    as between the parties is a third and independent component of the doctrine
    of laches.  Rather, this objective informs the requisite inquiries under
    the first and second branches of the doctrine.  Under either branch, equitable
    relief may be refused on the ground of laches in circumstances where the
    plaintiff’s conduct would make it unjust to grant the relief sought.  See <i>Lindsay
    Petroleum Co. v. Hurd</i> (1874), L.R. 5 P.C. 221 at 239-40; and <i>Erlanger
    v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.</i> (1878), 3 App. Cas. 1218 (H.L.) at 1279-80.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.’s
    claim that justice as between the parties mandates the denial of equitable
    relief to K.K. is predicated on the assertion that K.K.’s delay in commencing
    or prosecuting her action irreparably prejudiced K.W.G. because she was unable
    to testify and instruct counsel at trial.  In the unusual circumstances of
    this case, I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial indicated that K.W.G. was competent in 2000 when K.K.’s
    action was commenced and was still competent in 2001 when she was examined
    for discovery.  It appears that 2003-2004 marked the onset of her dementia.  There
    is no suggestion that her dementia was foreseeable.  Nor, apart from the
    fact of K.W.G.’s advancing age, is there any evidence to support such a claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, there is no assertion on K.W.G.’s behalf that K.K. knew or could
    have known, either before or when she initiated her lawsuit, that K.W.G.
    would become incompetent.  Nor does K.W.G. contend that K.K. was responsible
    for any delay in bringing the action to trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    while K.W.G.’s mental disorder is most unfortunate, there is no basis on
    this record to visit the consequences of her illness on K.K., or to conclude
    that the timing of the commencement of her lawsuit or its pace after commencement
    was influenced by her mother’s health.  K.W.G. simply succumbed to an unforeseen
    mental illness – dementia – after the commencement of K.K.’s lawsuit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    factor must be balanced against K.K.’s rights.  To hold that K.W.G.’s unexpected
    illness bars any equitable relief for K.K. would be to deny all redress for
    an admitted incest victim on account of an unforeseen development that was
    entirely beyond her control.  That outcome would scarcely serve the interests
    of justice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the record in this case is not silent as to K.W.G.’s history and version
    of events.  As I have mentioned, although K.W.G. was unable to participate
    at trial due to her mental illness, the trial judge granted K.K. leave to
    read-in K.W.G.’s discovery evidence as if it were her testimony at trial.  He
    also admitted K.W.G.’s memoir, which provided some insights into her background,
    life experiences and personality.  The reception of this evidence is not
    challenged on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, contrary to K.W.G.’s submission, the trial judge’s reasons indicate
    that he had the issue of alleged prejudice to K.W.G. well in mind.  In his
    analysis of the defence assertion that K.K. acquiesced in K.W.G.’s conduct,
    the trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I also reject the submission that acquiescence is
    established because of the prejudice that has resulted from age and infirmity
    intervening to prevent the defendant from testifying in her own defence.  Such
    an argument might be sustainable if the action was delayed until after the
    defendant had succumbed to dementia, but that is not the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would stress two additional factors.  First, R.G. was appointed as K.W.G.’s
    litigation guardian over the objections of K.K.  In her sworn affidavit materials
    filed in support of her motion to be appointed litigation guardian, R.G.
    essentially represented that, unlike other potential litigation guardian
    candidates, she was in an informed position to represent her mother’s interest,
    she had been involved in K.K.’s lawsuit from the beginning, and she intended
    to try and settle the action.  In his ruling allowing R.G.’s motion, the
    motion judge relied on this evidence to hold that R.G. was capable of properly
    assessing her mother’s legal situation so as to “make appropriate decisions
    concerning this lawsuit”.  This finding, and R.G.’s evidence on which it
    was based, undercut the submission that K.W.G.’s personal inability to instruct
    counsel at trial deprived her of the opportunity to properly defend the action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and more generally, the fiduciary nature of K.W.G.’s relationship with K.K.
    must again be emphasized.  The existence of a power imbalance, and the vulnerability
    of the beneficiary of the relationship to the fiduciary, is inherent to a
    fiduciary relationship.  It is difficult to conceive of a fiduciary relationship
    that involves a greater inequality of positions, or a more overriding degree
    of dependency, than that which arises in a young child’s relationship with
    his or her custodial parents.  For this reason, the law imposes on the parent
    a duty to act loyally and to ensure that the parent’s interests do not overtake
    those of the child in a manner that abuses the child’s trust or constitutes
    an abuse of power.  See <i>K.L.B., supra</i>; and <i>E.D.G., supra</i>.  Where
    these duties are breached in the manner established in this case, it is my
    opinion that justice mandates that the denial of equitable relief to the
    aggrieved plaintiff should be rare.</p>
  <h2><i>Conclusion on laches</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept that the timing of the initiation and prosecution of K.K.’s
    action worked a fundamental injustice on K.W.G. that should be charged to
    K.K. so as to justify the application of the doctrine of laches.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.’s
    response to K.K.’s claims of abuse and breach of fiduciary duty was documented
    in her pleading and her discovery evidence.  K.K.’s sisters testified for
    the defence.  That K.W.G.’s litigation guardian was able to instruct counsel
    concerning her defence is evident from the defence decision, taken shortly
    before trial, to concede – at that late date –
    the fact of P.G.’s sexual abuse of K.K.  In my view, K.W.G.’s litigation
    guardian was positioned to maintain her defence, to instruct counsel and,
    if so advised, to compromise K.W.G.’s defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    was a passive bystander to P.G.’s abuse.  However, this is not a case where
    the
    ‘bystander’ parent learned of the sexual abuse, for the first time, years
    after it occurred.  This is a case where, on the trial judge’s findings,
    the bystander parent knew of the abuse when it was ongoing but took no action
    of any kind to stop it or to obtain assistance for her victimized child.  In
    so doing, K.W.G. breached her fundamental trust obligation to her daughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, I conclude that the trial judge did not err in rejecting
    K.W.G.’s defence of laches.  </p>
  <h2>(2)       The Knowledge Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    argues that the trial judge’s finding that she knew of P.G.’s abuse of K.K.
    is unsustainable because the trial judge: (i) erred in “processing” the evidence
    bearing on this key issue, by disregarding or misapprehending relevant evidence
    and by making unsupportable findings regarding K.K.’s evidence; and (ii)
    further erred by providing insufficient reasons in support of the impugned
    finding.  I will consider each of these complaints in turn.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the alleged “processing” error.  K.W.G. faces a significant hurdle to succeed
    on this ground of appeal.  A processing error occurs where a trial judge
    fails to appreciate the evidence relevant to a factual issue, either by disregarding
    or misapprehending that evidence.  A processing error warrants appellate
    intervention if it taints that part of the trial judge’s reasoning process
    that was essential to the challenged finding of fact.  See <i>Keljanovic
    Estate v. Sanseverino</i> (2000), 186 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;

    ) at para. 334, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 291.  That
    said, as I have already indicated, the factual findings of a trial judge
    attract a high degree of deference from an appellate court and, absent palpable
    and overriding error, appellate interference with such findings is precluded.  See <i>Housen,
    supra</i>; <i>Waxman</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    to displace a factual finding on the basis of an alleged processing error
    by the trial judge, it is necessary to demonstrate both that the error occurred
    and that it was palpable and overriding.  Neither requirement is met here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence said by K.W.G. to have been ignored or misapprehended by the trial
    judge consists of evidence by K.K. and/or her sisters of events surrounding
    K.K.’s and I.H.’s disclosures of P.G.’s sexual abuse; K.K.’s reactions to,
    and conduct after, learning of I.H.’s claim of abuse; and events at the 1993
    family meeting when, according to K.K., K.W.G. acknowledged the grandmother
    incident.  The evidence of K.K.’s sisters on these issues conflicted with
    that of K.K. in many respects.  As well, there were inconsistencies between
    the testimony of each of the sisters concerning many events in the 1990s.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons indicate that he was aware of and considered the competing
    versions of events that took place in the 1990s advanced by K.K. and her
    sisters.  In particular, he noted the contradictions between K.K.’s testimony
    and that of her sisters concerning the discussion of the grandmother incident
    at the 1993 family meeting, which I have earlier set out.  Although the trial
    judge did not explicitly refer in his reasons to all the conflicting evidence
    on these issues, he was not obliged to do so.  See <i>Waxman</i> at paras.
    343-345.   There is no basis on this record to conclude that he failed to
    consider, or that he fundamentally misapprehended, the evidence of K.K. or
    her sisters on the key factual issues in dispute.  I am not persuaded, therefore,
    that the trial judge made the processing error alleged by K.W.G.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, even if it is assumed that the trial judge so erred, it is far
    from clear that this error would have had any effect on his essential reasoning.  In
    the trial judge’s view, the conflicting evidence of the recollections of
    K.K. and her sisters on events in the early 1990s and on the issue whether
    K.W.G. acknowledged the grandmother incident at the 1993 family meeting was
    of little consequence.  For example, with respect to the 1993 meeting, he
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not see that this conflict in the testimony
    of the plaintiff and her sisters is critical in determining whether [the
    grandmother] incident occurred.  I believe it did occur because of the convincing
    nature of the plaintiff’s description of the incident.  That event, like
    none other, must have had an enormous impact on the plaintiff.  It was then
    that the plaintiff came to know for certain that her mother was aware of
    the abuse but was not prepared to intervene.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the impugned finding of knowledge by K.W.G. was firmly anchored in the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the grandmother incident in fact occurred, as described
    by K.K.  This conclusion was not dependent on resolution of the witnesses’
    conflicting evidence concerning K.W.G.’s alleged acknowledgment, years later,
    of the incident.  K.K.’s evidence of the <i>fact</i> of the grandmother incident,
    once accepted by the trial judge, was sufficient to fix K.W.G. with knowledge
    of her husband’s sexual abuse of K.K.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also disagree with K.W.G.’s assertion that the trial judge’s treatment of
    K.K.’s evidence is tainted by the failure to consider or to correctly apprehend
    critical evidence in any material respect.  This argument, in effect, challenges
    the trial judge’s weighing of the evidence of K.K. and her sisters and his
    appreciation of their credibility.  One example will suffice to illustrate
    this point.  In her factum on appeal, K.W.G. argued that the trial judge
    erred by characterizing certain of K.K.’s evidence as “extravagant” while
    also accepting that the substance of her evidence about P.G.’s sexual abuse
    was truthful and accurate.  These are matters going to the heart of K.K.’s
    credibility, the assessment of which was squarely within the trial judge’s
    domain.  These findings attract great deference from this court.  I see no
    basis on which to conclude that they are tainted by reversible error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I would reject K.W.G.’s attack on the sufficiency of the trial judge’s reasons.  Those
    reasons are 26 pages and 90 paragraphs in length.  Properly read, they reveal
    the trial judge’s reasoning in support of his critical findings, including
    his key finding that K.W.G. knew of P.G.’s sexual abuse, and amply provide
    for meaningful appellate review.  Accordingly, they meet the sufficiency
    of reasons standard set out in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869
    and <i>R. v. Braich</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 324 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <h2>(3)       The Standard of Proof Issue</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    next argues that the trial judge erred by holding that, in order to establish
    a defence to K.K.’s claim of breach of fiduciary duty, K.W.G. was obliged
    to prove with “absolute certainty” that she was powerless to intervene to
    prevent P.G.’s abuse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    submission must be placed in context.  The defence led evidence at trial
    that K.W.G.’s personal history and characteristics may have prevented her
    from acting in the face of knowledge that K.K. was being sexually abused.  For
    example, the evidence indicated that while interned in a Russian labour camp,
    K.W.G. was herself subjected to repeated sexual abuse, as well as other atrocities.  Dr.
    Klassen testified that this history of sexual trauma, combined with K.W.G.’s
    alleged fear of her husband and other factors, “<i>may</i> have contributed
    to a style of adaptation that <i>could conceivably</i> have caused problems
    for her in dealing with various problems in her family, including the sexual
    abuse of her daughters”.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of this theory of an ‘inability to intervene’, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Indeed, I have no difficulty in accepting that a
    mother who is unable to act should not be held in breach of the duty to protect.  A
    fiduciary duty arises from the nature of the relationship and the ability
    to fulfill the duty is inferred from the relationship.  It is an inference
    that may be rebutted, but the evidentiary burden for doing so rests with
    the person on whom the duty is imposed by virtue of the relationship.  It
    is, therefore, incumbent upon the fiduciary to demonstrate that she did not
    have the ability, awareness and means to act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge thus held that if K.K. established a breach of fiduciary duty
    by K.W.G., the onus of proof shifted to K.W.G. to establish any asserted
    defence to that breach, including a defence based on a posited inability
    to intervene to prevent the abuse that gave rise to the breach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to emphasize that K.W.G.’s challenge on appeal concerns the <i>standard</i> of
    proof allegedly applied by the trial judge.  It does not concern the <i>burden</i> of
    proof.  K.W.G. does not contest the trial judge’s allocation of an evidential
    burden to her.  To the contrary, K.W.G.’s counsel acknowledged before this
    court that K.W.G. bore the onus at trial to establish the defence contention
    that she was unable to intervene to prevent P.G.’s abuse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    this case does not turn on the issue of burden of proof.  Rather, K.W.G.’s
    complaint is that the trial judge, in assessing her ability to intervene,
    applied too stringent a standard of proof by requiring proof to a standard
    of “absolute certainty”.  In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence advanced the theory of K.W.G.’s inability to intervene in response
    to the allegation that she breached her fiduciary obligation to protect K.K.  K.W.G.,
    therefore, did not merely deny the breach but also advanced the substantive
    defence of an alleged inability to act.  In these circumstances, while K.K.
    was obliged to establish the breach, K.W.G. bore an evidential burden to
    establish that her inability to act was a live issue, by either adducing
    sufficient evidence or pointing to other evidence on the record of her claimed
    inability to act.  See John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, <i>The
    Law of Evidence in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i> (Toronto and Vancouver: Butterworths, 1992) at 56 and 60-65.  If this
    threshold was met, the issue was whether the trial judge was ultimately persuaded
    on the evidence, to the requisite civil standard of proof, of K.W.G.’s alleged
    inability to act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the trial judge’s language or reasoning to explicitly suggest
    that he applied any standard of proof other than the civil standard of proof
    on a balance of probabilities in determining whether K.W.G. was powerless
    to intervene to protect her daughter from P.G.’s sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do I think that the error alleged arises by necessary implication.  The trial
    judge reviewed the expert evidence bearing on K.W.G.’s alleged powerlessness,
    including, especially, Dr. Klassen’s evidence.  On my reading of his reasons,
    he accepted this evidence – as far as it went – but concluded that it lacked
    sufficient cogency to support anything more than merely a theoretical possibility
    that K.W.G. had been powerless to protect K.K.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I accept that [K.W.G.’s] history and circumstances
    may have conspired to prevent her from acting in the face of knowledge that
    the plaintiff was being abused by P.G.  However, a determination that the
    defendant <i>may</i> have lacked the personal resources to intervene, as
    Dr. Klassen suggests, is not sufficient to support a finding that she was
    unable to act.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole, it is apparent that he viewed
    the expert evidence of K.W.G.’s asserted inability to intervene as too tentative
    and hypothetical to ground a finding that K.W.G. in fact experienced such
    powerlessness.  In my view, this is a fair reading of the evidence.  For
    example, as the trial judge noted, Dr. Klassen indicated that he was not
    in a position to comment on whether K.W.G. “would  have been able to deal,
    psychologically, with the notion [that K.K.] was being sexually abused” or “on
    the extent to which [K.W.G.] … may have … lacked the personal resources,
    for reasons not of her choosing, to intervene”.  Instead, Dr. Klassen listed
    several “<i>possible</i>” circumstances, that he said “<i>may</i>” have rendered
    K.W.G. unable to intervene.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    of K.K.’s sisters, R.G. and I.H., testified that K.W.G. feared P.G., as they
    did.  The third sister, E.N., said that
    “maybe” K.W.G. was afraid of P.G. and, like her daughters, “did what [she
    was] told and everything was good”.  The trial judge indicated that K.K.
    testified that her mother was “unafraid” of P.G.  In making this statement,
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence.  K.K. testified that while she
    did not know whether her mother feared P.G., she thought that K.W.G. “should
    have been fearful of him because I was”.  However, as I indicate below, it
    was not K.K.’s evidence but the evidence of K.W.G. herself on discovery from
    which the trial judge was entitled to conclude that K.W.G. was unafraid of
    P.G.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    discovery, K.W.G. said: P.G. was not “a tough guy” but, rather “a pussycat”;
    in their early years in Canada, she persuaded P.G. to give up a heavy drinking
    habit; when P.G. yelled at her, she “start[ed] laughing”; she would have
    left P.G. if he ever hit her; on one occasion when P.G. did strike her, she “packed
    her things” and threatened to leave him; when P.G. yelled at the children,
    she talked to him and told him that he “better shut up” and “Just leave them
    alone”; P.G. listened to her when she admonished him on that occasion; and,
    if she had seen P.G. hitting their children, she would have “took over for
    sure” and “Then I would be the boss”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    parts of K.W.G.’s discovery testimony are especially telling.  According
    to K.W.G., if she had ever witnessed her husband acting in a sexually inappropriate
    manner with their children, “I might be in jail because I might have killed
    him.  Things like that wouldn’t work with me if I would have seen this” and “If
    I would have seen something, you think I would let that happen?  I would
    be in jail.  I would have killed him.”  Then this exchange took place:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, the evidence of whether K.W.G. feared her husband was but one
    factor among many to be assessed by the trial judge in determining if K.W.G.
    was powerless to protect K.K.  Other evidence at trial contradicted the defence
    hypothesis of an inability on the part of K.W.G. to intervene to protect
    K.K.  This included K.K.’s evidence that her mother presented as strong,
    cold and self-assured and the evidence of K.W.G.’s long-standing solicitor – an
    independent witness – who described K.W.G. as a woman “who knows her own
    mind”, “a dominant personality” and a “drama queen”.  This evidence also
    supported the conclusion that K.W.G. was not powerless to intervene against
    her husband.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am persuaded that, in the end, the trial judge simply weighed the evidence
    that supported and countered the defence theory of K.W.G.’s inability to
    intervene and, while acknowledging the hypothetical possibility that she
    might have experienced such powerlessness, concluded on the evidence that
    this theory was unsustainable.  I see no reviewable error in this assessment
    of the evidence. </p>
  <h2>(4)       The Damages Issues</h2>
  <h2><i>Damages for lost income</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, K.K. claimed damages for lost income from 1959 until March 2006 – when
    she turned 65.  In support of this claim, she relied on Karen Dalton’s evidence
    of various methods by which her economic loss might be calculated.  On Ms.
    Dalton’s evidence, K.K.’s total lost income for the years in question ranged
    from $178,200 to $622,902.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.K.
    also relied on the evidence of Dr. Jaffe, who testified that the symptoms
    associated with child sexual abuse diminish the effectiveness of the victim
    at school or in the workplace.  Dr. Jaffe offered the opinion that K.K. did
    not achieve to her potential and that “it was more likely than not that the
    abuse had adversely impacted her ability to do so”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>K.W.G.
    responded with the evidence of her economic loss expert, Errol Soriano, and
    that of Dr. Klassen.  As I have said, unlike Dr. Jaffe, Dr. Klassen was not
    accepted at trial as an expert qualified to give opinion evidence on the
    economic consequences of sexual abuse.  Nonetheless, it appears that he did
    offer opinions on this issue during his testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen said that it was unlikely that P.G.’s sexual abuse was implicated
    in K.K.’s educational or occupational “trajectories”.  In his written report
    dated September 8, 2005, Dr. Klassen stated: “[I]t is not clear to me that
    [K.K.’s educational and occupational] course is referable to or predicated
    on the history of sexually assaultive behaviour.”  For his part, Mr. Soriano
    was critical of Ms. Dalton’s analysis of K.K.’s economic loss.  In his opinion,
    K.K. failed to adduce sufficient information to permit quantification of
    her claim for past lost income.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected Ms. Dalton’s analysis in its entirety and accepted Mr.
    Soriano’s opinion that K.K.’s lost income claim “defie[d] calculation”.  He
    also accepted Dr. Klassen’s evidence that factors other than P.G.’s sexual
    abuse affected K.K.’s educational and occupational achievements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the trial judge also expressly held that P.G.’s sexual abuse did have an
    adverse impact on K.K.’s income earning capacity.  With respect to K.W.G.’s
    conduct, he found that her failure to protect K.K. from P.G. not only exposed
    K.K. to “the physical trauma, humiliation and desperation of persistent abuse
    over many years” but also caused K.K. “psychological injury that has diminished
    her ability to function in virtually every aspect of her life” including “her
    effectiveness at school and in the workplace” and that this impediment was
    “significant”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s conclusion concerning K.K.’s economic loss claim was expressed
    in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Notwithstanding my concerns about the shortcomings
    of the evidence relating to the plaintiff’s economic loss, I am satisfied
    that there is sufficient evidence for me to find that the defendant’s failure
    to protect the plaintiff from her father’s abuse diminished her effectiveness
    at school and in the workplace and thereby impeded her ability to achieve
    her full potential.  In my view, this impediment had an adverse impact on
    her ability to earn income.  Although the claim defies precision in quantification,
    I am satisfied the impede-ment was significant and award the plaintiff damages
    of $100,000.00 for loss of income to March 16, 2006.</p>

    first proposition is incorrect.  Dr. Jaffe’s and K.K.’s evidence supported
    the trial judge’s finding that K.W.G.’s breach negatively affected K.K.’s
    ability to achieve her life potential, including her educational and occupational
    potential.  For example, on Dr. Jaffe’s evidence, K.W.G.’s failure to protect
    K.K. from P.G.’s abuse accounted for the extent and duration of the abuse
    and aggravated K.K.’s “level of dysfunction”.  A finding based on this evidence
    cannot be characterized as a finding without evidentiary support.</p>

    ) at para. 34, leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, [1998] S.C.C.A. No.
    516, Finlayson J.A. made the point that a plaintiff should not be able to
    recover a higher damages award merely because his or her claim is characterized
    as a breach of fiduciary duty, as opposed to breach of contract or tort.  Proof
    of damages is still required.  See also <i>Waxman, supra</i> at para. 661.  He
    further held that a plaintiff is not entitled to have damages assessed by
    guesswork when he or she fails to discharge his or her burden of adducing
    proof of damages (at paras. 67 and 74).   In the absence of such proof, rendering
    it impossible to assess damages, a plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages
    at best.  However, where there are complex contingencies, incapable of proof,
    a court must then do its best to assess the quantum of damages (at para.
    75).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case where the absence of evidence makes it impossible to assess
    damages, thereby reducing K.K.’s entitlement to only nominal damages at best.  In
    this case, unlike in <i>Goldfarb</i>, K.K. called evidence that assisted
    the court in proving and identifying the loss she suffered.  The trial judge
    was satisfied that her loss was
    “significant”.  What the trial judge rightly rejected was the basis for the
    calculation of K.K.’s loss.  What K.K. suffered was a lost opportunity to
    be in a safe environment that would have allowed her to continue her education
    at the time in her life when her career choices mattered most.  This lost
    opportunity is distinct from the general damages that the trial judge awarded.  See
    for example, <i>K.A.T. v. J.H.B.</i>, [1998] B.C.J. No. 1141 (B.C.S.C.) at
    para. 60.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge did his best to assess K.K.’s damages for economic loss,
    the factors on which he based his award significantly overlapped with those
    pertinent to his assessment of general damages.  Respectfully, the trial
    judge also failed to adequately consider the many other complex contingencies
    that had to be taken into account in assessing damages for the lost opportunity
    suffered by K.K.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge’s award of damages for lost income cannot stand.  In my opinion,
    on this record, $20,000 is a reasonable estimate of K.K.’s damages for her
    lost opportunity to maximize her earning potential.</p>

    also challenges the trial judge’s award of damages in the amount of $30,000
    for future care on the basis that K.K. had been receiving and could continue
    to receive publicly-funded counselling services.  As a result, K.W.G. maintains,
    the award of damages for future care amounts to “double recovery”.  I disagree.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drs.
    Jaffe and Klassen agreed that K.K. would benefit from ongoing treatment and
    counselling to deal with the effects of the sexual abuse that she endured.  Indeed,
    Dr. Jaffe recommended long term counselling on a weekly basis for up to ten
    years.  The trial judge’s reasons reveal that he considered the evidence
    regarding the publicly-funded psychological and psychiatric services in the
    community where K.K. resides and concluded that the availability of timely
    and accessible services was uncertain.  He was also of the view that K.K.
    was entitled to “some reasonable choice in her selection of available therapeutic
    regimes” and that she should have the opportunity to access private psychological
    counselling.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, he reduced K.K.’s claim for future care damages from the sum
    of $85,000 to $30,000, to take account of K.K.’s duty to mitigate her damages.  This
    significantly reduced award, in the trial judge’s view, was sufficient to
    meet K.K.’s “reasonable long term therapeutic needs”.  I see no basis on
    which to interfere with this assessment of damages.</p>

    to trial, K.K. made an offer to settle under Rule 49 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  The offer was not accepted.  When
    the offer proved to be more favourable to K.W.G. than the result at trial,
    K.K. sought recovery of her costs on a partial indemnity scale to the date
    of her offer and on a substantial indemnity scale thereafter, in accordance
    with rule 49.10(1).  The trial judge declined to award costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale and, instead, awarded K.K. her costs throughout on a partial
    indemnity scale.  K.K. cross-appeals from that decision.</p>

     The language of rule 49.10(1) expressly permits a trial judge to depart
    from a strict application of the rule.  This court has held that the trial
    judge is in the best position to determine whether such a departure is warranted
    on an exceptional basis in a particular case.  See <i>Orlando Corp. v Bothwell-Accurate

    this discretionary decision was plainly wrong or tainted by an error in principle.  Accordingly,

    have had the opportunity to read the draft reasons of my colleague Justice
    Cronk.  I agree with her reasons and her disposition with respect to the
    trial judge’s award of $100,000 for lost income and with her decision to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully,
    however, my analysis leads me to a different conclusion concerning the appellant’s
    liability.  I would allow the appeal in that regard for two reasons.  First,
    while I agree with the trial judge – and with my colleagues –
    that the appellant mother owed a fiduciary duty to her daughter to protect
    her from sexual abuse by her father if able to do so, the trial judge erred
    in arriving at his conclusion that the appellant had the ability to do so
    in these circumstances.  Secondly, he erred in failing to apply the doctrine
    of <i>laches</i> in favour of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    of these issues take their texture from the fact that the appellant, who
    was eighty-two years old at the time of trial, was by then suffering from
    dementia, had become legally incapacitated, and was unable to provide instructions,
    participate, or testify at the trial.  Through no fault of her own she was
    not there to defend herself in a case that turned on issues of credibility.  </p>
  <h4>Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not question that a fiduciary relationship exists between parent and child:
    see <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.), </i>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 6.  I also do not question that
    a mother owes a fiduciary duty to protect a child from sexual abuse by the
    child’s father where she is capable of doing so and fails to take reasonable
    steps to do so in the circumstances: see, for example, <i>J.(L.A.) v. J.(H.)</i> (1993),
    13 O.R. (3d) 306 (Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)); <i>L.T. v. R.W.T.</i> (1997), 36 B.C.L.R.
    (3d) 165 (S.C.); and <i>P.B. v. R.V.E.,</i> [2007] B.C.J. No. 2305 (S.C.).  I
    also accept without hesitation the dreadful nature of the incestual abuse
    inflicted on the respondent by her father as well as its grave and enduring
    consequences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully,
    however, the trial judge erred by concluding, in effect, that because the
    expert, Dr. Klassen, could only say that the appellant <i>may</i> have lacked
    the personal resources to intervene on behalf of her daughter, the appellant
    had not met the burden of establishing she was incapable of acting in furtherance
    of her fiduciary obligations.  Two things concern me about this.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant had no such burden.  By conflating an “evidential burden” to
    show there is sufficient evidence of a fact to put it in play with an “ultimate
    burden” to establish a fact, the trial judge lost sight of the plaintiff’s
    overall burden.  The plaintiff’s overall burden is to show, on a balance
    of probabilities, that the appellant had breached her fiduciary duty by failing
    to take reasonable steps to prevent the abuse.  The trial judge erred by
    placing the onus on the appellant to demonstrate that she was incapable of
    acting. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly,
    the trial judge’s analysis of this issue is tainted by his failure to consider
    the argument of appellant’s counsel at trial that it was the cumulative effect
    of the evidence of the father’s dominance at home, the trauma from sexual
    and other abuse she had suffered while interred in a prison camp in the former
    Soviet Union, and the societal realities of the 1950’s that affected the
    appellant’s ability to respond.  Although the trial judge acknowledged this
    argument, he gave it little – if any – consideration in his analysis, instead
    focusing primarily on the evidence of the expert witness Dr. Klassen.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The Onus Question</span></u></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    behalf of the appellant, Mr. Honickman argued that the trial judge imposed
    an impossible standard on the appellant by requiring her to prove with “absolute
    certainty” that she was powerless to intervene.  I am not able to find anything
    in the reasons of the trial judge that articulates or suggests such a standard.  What
    the trial judge did do, however, was to infer a rebuttable presumption that
    the appellant had the ability to fulfill her fiduciary duty from the existence
    of the relationship itself.  He also held that she had failed to meet the
    evidentiary burden of rebutting that inference.  He said at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A fiduciary duty [between a mother and child] arises
    from the nature of the relationship and the ability to fulfill the duty is
    inferred from the relationship.  It is an inference that may be rebutted,
    but the evidentiary burden for doing so rests with the person on whom the
    duty is imposed by virtue of the relationship.  <i>It is, therefore, incumbent
    upon the fiduciary to demonstrate that she did not have the ability, awareness
    and means to act.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge cited no authority for the proposition that the existence of
    a fiduciary relationship creates a rebuttable inference that the person on
    whom the duty is imposed by virtue of the relationship has the ability to
    fulfill that duty.  He nonetheless rejected the appellant’s argument on this
    ground at trial because he concluded that Dr. Klassen’s evidence that the
    appellant <i>may</i> have lacked the resources to intervene was “not sufficient
    to support a finding that she was unable to act.”  In my view, the issue
    was not whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that she
    was unable to act, much less whether the defendant fiduciary had demonstrated
    that fact.  Although such a finding would clearly result in the dismissal
    of the claim, it was not necessary that it be made.  The question was whether
    the plaintiff had met her overall burden of demonstrating that the appellant
    had breached her fiduciary obligation by failing to take reasonable steps
    in the circumstances to intervene when she had the ability to do so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Honickman conceded that there was an evidentiary shift in the burden in cases
    of this nature.  Nonetheless, the ultimate or “persuasive” burden remains
    on the plaintiff.   In law, the evidentiary burden is not a burden “to establish” anything.  As
    Dickson C.J.C. pointed out in <i>R. v. Schwartz</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443
    at 466-467:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The party who has the persuasive burden is required
    to persuade the trier of fact, to convince the trier of fact that a certain
    set of facts existed. Failure to persuade means that the party loses. <i>The
    party with an evidential burden is not required to convince the trier of
    fact of anything, only to point out evidence which suggests that certain
    facts existed.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with my colleague’s view of the nature of the evidentiary shift, as
    expressed in para. 102 of her reasons<b>:</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In these circumstances, while K.K. was obliged
    to establish the breach, K.W.G. bore an <i>evidential burden to establish
    that her inability to act was a live issue</i>, by either adducing sufficient
    evidence or pointing to other evidence on the record of her claimed inability
    to act.  See John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, <i>The

    J.S. Sigurdson accurately expressed that burden in cases of this nature,
    in my view, in <i>B.P. v. R.V.E., supra</i>.  At paras. 246-247 he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, in the circumstances, I have concluded
    that the evidence is not sufficiently clear and cogent to find liability
    on the part of [the mother].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although I prefer the evidence of [the daughter]
    generally over that of her mother, I find that insofar as the claim against
    her mother is concerned, there <i>is insufficient evidence to demonstrate

    J.’s reference to “clear and cogent” evidence to support liability warrants
    some reflection as well, given the nature of the allegations.  Courts have
    held that they are to take greater care in scrutinizing the evidence in civil
    cases when allegations of a serious nature – such as sexual misconduct or
    other conduct of a morally blameworthy nature – are made.  Allegations that
    a mother has breached her fiduciary duty by failing to protect her daughter
    from sexual abuse by her father fall into a similar category, in my opinion.  This
    view of the civil burden does not represent a change in the balance of probabilities
    standard, but merely the application of that standard “with careful scrutiny
    of the evidence in a manner that is proportionate with the serious claims
    being alleged”: <i>B.P. v. R.V.E.</i> at para. 127.  See <i>Continental Insurance

    capacity to act consist of the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[58]     Dr. Klassen addressed the issue of the
    defendant’s capacity to act in the following excerpt from his report of September
    8, 2005:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In addition to being unable to comment on whether
    or not [the respondent’s] mother may or may not have known about the alleged
    sexual behaviour, including its scope or duration, on a cognitive level,
    I am also not in a position to comment on whether or not [the respondent’s]
    mother would have been able to deal, psychologically, with the notion that
    her daughter was being sexually assaulted by her husband.  By means of example,
    one cannot rule out the possibility that [the respondent’s] mother herself
    was traumatized in one or more ways, leading to extensive use of denial and
    repression to manage conflict.  As well, there may have been a relationship
    dynamic between  [the respondent’s] mother and father that may have made
    it difficult for [the respondent’s] mother to feel empowered to act on information
    that she may have had, given that [the respondent’s] father was described
    as violent and domineering.  In short, I believe that it is impossible for
    me to comment on the extent to which [the appellant] may have known of the
    sexually assaultive behaviour, and <i>it is similarly difficult if not impossible
    for me to comment meaningfully on the extent to which </i>[the respondent’s]<i> mother,
    if she knew, may have engaged in wilful neglect of </i>[the respondent],<i> as
    opposed to having lacked the personal resources, for reasons not of her choosing,
    to intervene.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[59]     Notwithstanding the bravado displayed
    by the defendant in her memoir and on her examination for discovery, I accept
    that her history and circumstances may have conspired to prevent her from
    acting in the face of knowledge that the plaintiff was being abused by [the
    father].  However, a determination that the defendant<i> may</i> have lacked
    the personal resources to intervene, as Dr. Klassen suggests, is not sufficient
    to support a finding that she was unable to act.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[60]     I, therefore, conclude that the defendant
    breached her fiduciary duty to the plaintiff when she failed to protect the
    plaintiff from the physical and sexual abuse that she knew was being perpetrated
    by [the father].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s analysis, then, focuses on Dr. Klassen’s comment that the appellant <i>may</i> have
    lacked the personal wherewithal to intervene, from which he concluded there
    was not sufficient evidence “to support a finding that [the appellant] was
    unable to act.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was considered insufficient to meet the<i> appellant’s</i> onus, and therein
    lies the error regarding the burden of proof, in my view.  The trial judge’s
    discounting of the
    “bravado” displayed by the appellant in her memoir and on discovery, and
    his acceptance “that her history and circumstances may have conspired to
    prevent her from acting in the face of knowledge that the plaintiff was being
    abused by [the father]” were enough to make the appellant’s inability to
    intervene “a live issue” – to adopt my colleague’s phraseology.  The question
    should then have become whether on all of that evidence, the <i>plaintiff</i> had
    met her onus of demonstrating that the appellant had breached her fiduciary
    duty by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the abuse when she was
    able to do so.  That is not the question the trial judge asked, however.  Instead,
    he essentially asked only whether <i>the appellant</i> had demonstrated that
    she <i>did not</i> have the ability, awareness and means to act; he did not
    direct his mind to determining whether <i>the plaintiff</i> had demonstrated
    in all the circumstances that the appellant <i>did </i>have the ability,
    awareness and means to act. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, considerable evidence was led at trial about the dynamics of the
    family and the father’s role in it, and about the historical sexual and other
    abuse the mother herself was subjected to in the Russian prison camp.  In
    addition, the appellant had attempted to deal with those issues in her memoir
    and she gave evidence about them on her examination for discovery.  The trial
    judge did review some of that evidence earlier in his reasons.  But except
    for his general reference to it in the passage from his reasons cited immediately
    above, he gives no indication how that evidence played into his determination
    about the appellant’s ability to fulfill her fiduciary obligations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore,
    the trial judge misapprehended a key piece of the respondent’s evidence.  The
    respondent has three sisters.  The evidence of the sisters was that their
    father was the dominating force in the family and that they, <i>and their
    mother</i>, were afraid of him.  He was the boss, they said, and everyone – again,
    including the appellant – did what he told them to do.  In contrast, the
    trial judge said that the respondent described the appellant as “unafraid
    of her father”.  The respondent did volunteer that comment in the context
    of an answer to the effect that her mother would talk back to her father.  However,
    it was not the thrust of the respondent’s evidence that her mother was “unafraid
    of her father”, a man whom she described variously as “cruel”, “vicious” and
    a “monster”.  In fact her evidence on this issue was at least neutral and
    arguably was to the contrary.  In cross-examination the following exchange
    took place:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        When did your mother stand up to your
    father?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        <i>She would talk back to him.  She wasn’t
      afraid of him.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        <i>Well, I thought you said before that
      you agreed that she may have been fearful of him?</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        <i>Well, that – I thought that, but I
      don’t know if she was.  I just felt she should have been fearful of him
      because I was.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        And I wrote down different words that
    you’ve used at different times describing your father, cruel, correct?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Fault-finding?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Terrifying, humiliating, correct?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        And you have absolutely no idea, I’m
    going to suggest to you, the scope, for example, of any abuse if there was
    any against your mother by your father, correct?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No, I haven’t.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        You have no idea?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Could have been, verbally? Was he – he
    was verbally abusive in front of you to your mother, correct?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        You don’t know if he was physically abusive?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No, I don’t.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        You have absolutely no idea of what when
    on, to use the vernacular, behind closed doors, behind the two of them, do
    you?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No, I don’t.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        You don’t know what level of trauma,
    if any, your mother may have experienced at the hands of your father, do
    you?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        And – and you agree with me, you have
    no idea what was going on with your mother psychologically back then in the
    1950’s with respect to her own personal trauma and what she could do or couldn’t
    do, correct?  You have no idea, right?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I have no idea.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        <i>And was it your perception back then
      that your mother was fearful of your father at any time?</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        <i>It wasn’t my perception.  I just felt
      she –
    she was possibly fearful of him, because I was fearful of him.</i></p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s view that the appellant was
    “unafraid of her father [the husband]” is troubling, and significant.  The
    trial judge made no findings of credibility as between the respondent and
    her three sisters.  Indeed, he went out of his way not to do so, taking the
    view that there were understandable inaccuracies in all of their testimonies
    and that it was unnecessary for him to make such findings.  However, his
    disposition of the case can only be supported on the basis that he accepted
    the evidence of the respondent where he had to do so, and this, in turn,
    has implications for his acceptance or rejection of the appellant’s version
    of events as set out on her examination for discovery, particularly when
    the appellant was incapable of presenting that version of events personally
    to the judge at trial.  I shall return to this specific point in more detail
    when dealing with the issue of <i>laches</i>.  For present purposes, it is
    sufficient to say that the trial judge misapprehended the respondent’s evidence
    on a very key point. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence of the respondent’s three siblings was that they were all afraid
    of their father, including the appellant mother.  The evidence of the respondent – at
    best – was that she did not know, but that she too thought that her mother
    was afraid of her abuser.  Had that evidence been considered by the trial
    judge in the course of his analysis about whether the appellant had the ability
    to intervene to protect her daughter – along with the evidence of the other
    sisters and the appellant about her historical abuse, and with some recognition
    of societal mores in the 1950’s at least discouraging the public disclosure
    of such events – it might well have affected the trial judge’s decision on
    this issue.  This might be so, particularly, had the trial judge concentrated,
    as he should have, on the<i> plaintiff’s</i> overall burden to show that
    the appellant breached her fiduciary duty by failing to take reasonable steps
    to intervene when she had the ability to do so rather than placing the burden
    on the appellant to establish that fact.  This is all enhanced by the trial
    judge’s downplaying of the appellant’s attempts in her memoir and on discovery
    to portray herself as a strong independent woman by dismissing them as bravado. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal and, in other circumstances, would have ordered a
    new trial on this ground alone.  Because of the view I take on the application
    of the doctrine of <i>laches</i> in this case, however, I am satisfied that
    the appeal should be allowed and the plaintiff’s action dismissed.  I turn
    to the issue of <i>laches</i> now.</p>
  <h4>The Doctrine of <i>Laches</i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    colleague has outlined the principles governing the application of the doctrine
    of <i>laches</i>, as articulated by La Forest J. in <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i>.  There
    are two branches to the doctrine, and it is well-established that mere delay – even
    extensive delay – does not, by itself, disentitle an applicant to equitable
    relief.  For convenience, I repeat the statement of La Forest J. at pp. 77-78
    of <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i> defining the doctrine:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Thus there are two distinct branches to the
      laches doctrine, and either will suffice as a defence to a claim in equity</i>.  What
      is immediately obvious from all of the authorities is that mere delay is
      insufficient to trigger laches under either of its two branches.  <i>Rather,
      the doctrine considers whether the delay of the plaintiff constitutes acquiescence
      or results in circumstances that make the prosecution of the action unreasonable.</i>  <i>Ultimately,
      laches must be resolved as a matter of justice as between the parties</i>,
      as is the case with any equitable doctrine. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    purposes of disposing of the appeal I need not accept the appellant’s argument
    that the trial judge erred by concluding that acquiescence on the part of
    the respondent had not been established.  I say that because I am satisfied
    that he did err in failing to hold that the equitable relief claimed by the
    respondent should be denied “as a matter of justice between the parties” because
    the inescapable reality is that, by the time of trial, the delay had resulted
    in a situation where it was unjust to find and impose liability on the appellant
    in the circumstances.  The appellant was eighty-two years of age by then.  She
    was legally incapacitated, unable to instruct her counsel, and incapable
    of participating or testifying at trial.  This in a case that turned fundamentally
    on issues of credibility and involved an elderly woman who was herself a
    victim of abuse.  The events in question had taken place almost fifty years
    earlier and the frailties of age had caught up with her.  She did not have
    the capacity, or the ability, to defend herself at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to my colleague and the trial judge, I do not accept that the operative
    moment for the purposes of <i>laches</i> in these circumstances is when the
    action was commenced (the appellant was competent at that time).  Nor do
    I take the existence of her memoir or the fact that she was able to be examined
    for discovery prior to trial to be particularly determinative of this issue.  In
    circumstances such as these, the colour and texture of aids such as these
    depend very much on what the witness says about them at trial – and how the
    witness says it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is the <i>effect</i> of the delay that is critical.  The appellant was elderly
    when the action was commenced.  Indeed, the respondent had cared for her
    during a period of serious illness in the 1990’s when she almost died.  The
    fact that she might become incapacitated at any time was reasonably foreseeable.  The
    effect of the delay is that she was incapacitated by the time of trial and
    the trial judge did not have the benefit of seeing her and listening to her
    testimony in relation to these issues.  While no one can overlook – and I
    do not wish to minimize for an instant
    – the appalling abuse to which the respondent was subjected, it was in my
    view manifestly unfair to impose liability for that abuse on the non-committing
    parent who was incapable of defending herself and telling her story at the
    only time it counted in a case such as this: the trial.  It was the respondent’s
    delay in bringing her action that permitted this unjust situation to arise. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    view is consistent with the summary of the principles relating to <i>laches</i> cited

    Forest in the passage immediately preceding the one outlined above from <i>M.(K.)
    v. M.(H.)</i> at p. 77:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The rule developed in [<i>Lindsay Petroleum Co.
      v. Hurd</i> (1874), L.R. 5 P.C. 221] is certainly amorphous, perhaps admirably
      so.  However, some structure can be derived from the cases.  A good discussion
      of the rule and of <i>laches</i> in general is found in Meagher, Gummow
      and Lehane, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 755-65, where the authors distill the
      doctrine in this manner, at p. 755:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>It is a defence which requires that a defendant
    can successfully resist an equitable (although not a legal) claim made against
    him if he can demonstrate that the plaintiff, by delaying the institution
    or prosecution of his case, <i>has either</i> (a) acquiesced in the defendant’s
    conduct <i>or</i> (b) caused the defendant to alter his position in reasonable
    reliance on the plaintiff’s acceptance of the status quo, <i>or otherwise

    on statements contained in <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.) </i>to the effect that the
    rigorous application of limitation periods is inapt in incest cases<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>, my colleague concludes that “the applicable jurisprudence
    and the policy considerations that underlie it tell strongly against a rigorous
    application of the doctrine of <i>laches</i> in an incest case, whether claims
    are advanced against the abusive or the ‘bystander’ parent”.  I would prefer
    to leave for another day consideration of whether the same “rigorous” ethic
    that the courts have applied to limitation period defences in sexual assault
    and incest cases as between the victim and the direct perpetrator of the
    abuse should be extended to parties that are arguably more remote participants.  For
    myself, I do not see the doctrine of <i>laches</i> as being the subject of
    either a “rigorous” or
    “non-rigorous” application.  <i>Laches</i> is an equitable doctrine designed
    to be applied flexibly on the facts of each case to ensure, ultimately, that
    the case is “resolved as a matter of justice as between the parties.” </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    reluctance on this issue is driven partly by the fact that much is unknown
    about the relatively new concept of imposing liability for abuse on the parent
    – usually the mother – who did not perpetrate the abuse directly.  This is
    particularly so in the context of historical incest or sexual abuse committed
    in a different social era, as is the case here.  Elizabeth K.P. Grace and
    Susan M. Vella highlight some of these concerns in their article “Vesting
    Mothers with the Power They Do Not Have: The Non-Offending Parent in Civil
    Sexual Assault Cases: J.(L.A.) v. J.(H.) and J.(J.)” (1994) 7
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Can.</st1:country-region>
    J. Women &amp; L. 184-196.  The following comments at pp. 186-187 are instructive:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Non-offending mothers’ role in and accountability
    for sexual abuse perpetrated against children by father figures raises many
    difficult and intractable questions.  For instance, given the comparatively
    greater power that mothers as adults have vis-à-vis their children, under
    what circumstances should legal responsibility be pinned on individual mothers
    for failing to protect their children form sexual violence?  Is it appropriate
    to use the civil courts to vindicate a survivor’s feelings of anger and betrayal
    against her mother and to reduce her self-blame when the mother is essentially
    being blamed for her powerlessness?  <i>The propriety of imposing liability
    on mothers must be considered in light of the gender inequality that permeates
    our social, economic, and political structures (including families)</i>,
    as well as the lack of publicly-funded shelters and treatment facilities
    for victims of sexual and physical abuse.  Before more dangerous precedents
    like <i>J. (L.A.)</i> are set, there needs to be a process of debate and
    reflections, both within the broader feminist movement and among lawyers
    doing plaintiff-side sexual assault work, about the degree to which non-offending
    mothers should be made responsible <i>in law</i> for the sexual abuse suffered
    by their children at the hands of father figures.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It may be too late and, indeed, undesirable to
    turn back the clock on recent advances in the law pertaining to sexual assault
    that have imposed private law duties of care and fiduciary obligations on
    persons and institutions in positions of power and trust.  <i>However, there
    is a sad, if predictable, irony to these developments being used against
    one of the weakest links in the chain of child sexual abuse – namely non-offending
    mothers</i>.  Unquestionably, mothers owe both a duty of care and a fiduciary
    duty to their children.  The issue to be considered is whether, so long as
    they are denied viable choices and the power to prevent the abuse, mothers
    should be held to have breached their legal obligations.  <i>Otherwise, an
    enormous gulf will continue to develop between a system of legal regulation
    that imposes partial, privatized solutions by vesting individual, non-offending
    mothers with power they probably did not have, and a society that refuses
    to provide the means by which real choices can be exercised</i>. [Emphasis

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    concerns expressed by Grace and Vella resonate in the context of the debate
    about the application of the doctrine of <i>laches</i> here, in my view.  Their
    comments are directed at the problem of using modern day standards to inform
    a duty that existed in a different social era.  These concerns evoke even
    more caution – and even more concern about <i>laches</i> in circumstances
    such as this – in the present context, in my view.  We are dealing with family
    incest occurring almost half a century before the trial, in a societal era
    with quite different perspectives and coping mechanisms respecting such abuse
    than the era in which the case was tried.  We are dealing, as well, with
    a family itself coming from an abusive post-World War II prison camp experience.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    previously noted, the trial judge acknowledged the argument of appellant’s
    counsel at trial that it was the cumulative impact of her husband’s dominance
    within the family, the trauma she experienced in the prison camp, and the
    prevailing societal mores of the 1950’s that led to the appellant’s powerlessness
    to intervene.  In the absence of the appellant’s participation at the trial,
    however, the trial judge appears not to have assessed these matters in the
    context of the <i>laches</i> debate.  Moreover, as noted above in the section
    of these reasons dealing with the burden of proof, the trial judge misapprehended
    the respondent’s testimony on a key point going to the appellant’s ability
    to intervene – concluding erroneously that the respondent’s evidence was
    that her mother was “unafraid” of her father.  The testimony of her siblings
    was to the contrary.  The absence of the appellant’s testimony at trial to
    provide the trial judge with some direct insight into this central issue
    only highlights the unfairness resulting from the delay between the underlying
    events and the trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    I recall again the need for “clear and cogent” evidence, and for “careful
    scrutiny” of that evidence, in cases of this nature.<b>  </b>There is particular
    meaning to this in the <i>laches</i> context where – as here – a party is
    incompetent and cannot participate or testify at trial.  The trial judge
    is deprived of the opportunity to weigh the evidence of that party in determining
    whether the burden of proof has been met.  Although the proceedings can lead
    to a high stigma finding of liability and the evidence thus requires a high
    level of scrutiny, some of the most important evidence – the testimony of
    the appellant herself – was not available at trial and was therefore subjected
    to a much lower level of scrutiny. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some
    reliance is placed on the fact that the appellant was able to testify at
    her examination for discovery and that over the course of that examination,
    and in her memoir, she portrayed herself as an independent woman able to
    stand up to her husband. Justice Cronk outlines some of this evidence at
    paras. 107-109 of her reasons.  I do not doubt that parts of the memoir and
    the discovery evidence could be interpreted in that fashion.  However, to
    the extent that this part of the record was referred to by the trial judge,
    as I have earlier observed, he appears to have discounted it as “bravado” on
    the part of the appellant.  Whether the trial judge’s reaction – had he been
    able to hear and see a competent appellant give evidence at trial – would
    have been to interpret the bravado as even greater bravado or to interpret
    it as something else is something we cannot know.  Therein lies the unfairness
    in forcing the appellant to undergo a trial in which she could not defend
    herself in the most important of ways – by testifying – and in finding her
    legally responsible in such circumstances. </p>

    paras. 77-78 of her reasons Justice Cronk states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            Consequently, while K.W.G’s mental
    disorder is most unfortunate, there is no basis on this record to visit the
    consequences of her illness on K.K., or to conclude that the timing of the
    commencement of her lawsuit or its pace after commencement was influenced
    by her mother’s health.  K.W.G. simply succumbed to an unforeseen mental
    illness – dementia – after the commencement of K.K.’s lawsuit.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span>            </span>This factor must be balanced
    against K.K.’s rights.  To hold that K.W.G’s unexpected illness bars any
    equitable relief for K.K would be to deny all redress for an admitted incest
    victim on account of an unforeseen development that was entirely beyond her
    control.  That outcome would scarcely serve the interests of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this respect I simply see the case differently than my colleague.  While
    I do not suggest that either the commencement or the pace of the lawsuit
    by the respondent were influenced by the appellant’s health, dementia in
    a person approaching or in her eighties is hardly uncommon or unforeseeable
    and it is not a situation that was “entirely beyond the [respondent’s] control”.  She
    could have
    – and should have – started her action sooner.  The trial judge found that
    it was during the discussion about the grandmother incident in 1993 “that
    the plaintiff came to know for certain that her mother was aware of the abuse
    but was not prepared to intervene.”  The respondent could have started her
    action at least by then.  But she did not.  Instead, she waited seven years,
    a period during which she knew – because she had cared for her mother at
    a time when she almost died – that the appellant’s health was failing.  In
    so doing she permitted a situation to arise where, “as a matter of justice
    as between the parties,” it was unjust to make adverse findings against her
    and to impose liability.</p>

    below, and substitute a judgment dismissing the action.  I would award the
    appellant her costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis.</p>

    second branch of the doctrine of laches by arguing that the trial judge erred

    of laches in the incest context in the contemporary legislative approach
    to limitation periods and sexual assault.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. recognizes
    that, in the case of sexual assault, the passage of considerable time may
    be required before the claimant both appreciates the assault and its effects
    and is sufficiently empowered to advance a legal claim.  Under the Act, the
    standard two-year limitation period does not run in respect of a claim based
    on sexual assault during any time in which the claimant is incapable of commencing
    the proceeding (s. 10(1)).  Instead, a sexual assault claimant is presumed
    to be incapable of commencing litigation before his or her action is actually
    initiated, unless this presumption is rebutted by evidence of an earlier
    capability to sue (s. 10(3)). </p>

    is no suggestion here that K.K.’s realization of her rights presumptively
    materialized upon the commencement of therapy.  While K.K. began counselling
    for sexual abuse in October 2000, she acknowledged at trial that she had
    consulted a lawyer and decided to sue K.W.G. sometime in the summer of 2000.</p>
