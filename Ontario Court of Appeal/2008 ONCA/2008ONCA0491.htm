line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s appeal is based on the position that the Family Court Judge did
    not accord her procedural safeguard standards in the hearing on September
    6, 2006 when the children were made Crown wards without access. That hearing
    was the return date for a status review hearing under the <i>Child and Family
    Services Act</i>. The children had been found in need of protection on September
    7, 2005 and the appellant, a family friend, had been granted twelve months
    custody of the children under a CAS supervision order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the children were apprehended from her custody in May 2006 following a police
    incident where crack cocaine trafficking was alleged to have been conducted
    at her home. A hearing was therefore held in May 2006 when the children were
    put in foster care, and the status review was adjourned to September 6, 2006.
    The appellant and her lawyer were in attendance that day. Her lawyer had
    brought a motion to get off the record to be heard that day. She was in default
    of providing the required information to the court and to CAS, and had relapsed
    into her previous drug problem at that time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CAS asked the court at the status review hearing on September 6, 2006 for
    a date for a summary judgment motion. However, the judge determined that
    there was no triable issue for a summary judgment motion. The appellant was
    at that time not rehabilitated from her drug problem, and had not complied
    with previous court orders. Furthermore, her original plan of care was conditional
    on her being drug free and it is clear that she was not at that time. The
    appellant and her lawyer were present and participated in the hearing. No
    adjournment was requested but there was no basis for seeking one in any event.
    We are therefore satisfied that on this record there was no procedural unfairness
    at the hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    specifically do not decide the issue whether the appellant was at that date
    a parent under s. 57 of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, given that
    the children had been apprehended from her care and therefore were no longer
    in her custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledged that on the merits of the issue of what was in the
    best interests of the children, the appellant is not in a position to argue
    against the disposition in this case. As this court and others have said
    on numerous occasions including in a decision of this court in <i>Children’s
    Aid Society of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo</i> <i>v. V.L</i>.,
    dated February 20, 2007: “Time is an important consideration in the <i>Child
    and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 and a child is not to be
    kept in limbo while a parent having difficulties attempts to straighten out
    her life”. That was the basis on which the Family Court Judge and the Appeal
    Court Judge proceeded in this matter. Both the Family Court Judge and the
    Appeal Court Judge made no error and their disposition is clearly in the
    best interests of the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed, in the circumstances without costs.</p>
