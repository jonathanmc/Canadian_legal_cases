  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that s. 426(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires proof
    that acceptance of the benefit, which is admitted in this case, actually
    influenced the appellant in the way she conducted the affairs with her employer.  As
    we read s. 426(1), the offence is established by proof that agents have,
    by accepting a secret benefit, placed themselves in a position of conflict
    of interest without alerting their principals.  That was the case here.  We
    have considered the other grounds in the appellant’s factum, but have concluded
    they are without merit.  The conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    imposing sentence, the trial judge carefully explained that the appellant
    could not expect to receive as light a sentence as received by her superior,
    who planned and set up the scheme, because he had pleaded guilty at an earlier
    stage and had cooperated with the authorities in prosecuting others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the trial judge conclusion that a jail term was necessary was based
    on her characterization of the appellant’s crime as a well-planned fraud
    upon the public purse.  In our view, the record does not support this characterization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the secret money was paid to the appellant out of the account of a private
    company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    while secret payments were made, the evidence did not establish the existence
    of a fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    while in most cases it may well be fairly inferred that kickbacks paid by
    companies that contract with government entities have the effect of inflating
    the cost of the goods and services purchased, the evidence in this case is
    to the contrary.  Here, the evidence established that neither the amount
    of the contract between the private company and the school board, nor the
    amount of the grant made by Human Resources Development Canada to the school
    board was inflated by the kickback scheme.  Rather, the evidence establishes
    that the amount of the grant was determined and the contract with the private
    company was executed before making of any secret payments was even discussed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    decided that the trial judge erred in concluding that the jail time was necessary
    because there had been a fraud on the public purse, it falls to us to determine
    the appropriate sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the seriousness of the offence in contributing with the culture of dishonesty
    in school board affairs, we take particular note of the following factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The
    appellant had no prior record;</li>
    <li>She
    made full restitution;</li>
    <li> The
      conviction had had a devastating impact on her – she has lost her employment
    and career with the school board;</li>
    <li> She
      played a junior role in setting up the scheme that was orchestrated by
    her immediate superior;</li>
    <li> While
      her charges were outstanding, she cooperated with the police and testified
      for the Crown in respect of more serious allegations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    believe that the trial judge aptly caught the nature of the appellant’s involvement
    by saying: “The cumulative effect of all of this evidence leads to the inescapable
    conclusion that she knew that what she was taking was wrong.  Hers was simply
    a willing, if naïve, acceptance of improper payments that others were also
    getting.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all the circumstances, we would allow the sentence appeal, set aside the
    term of imprisonment imposed and replace it with a conditional sentence of
    eighteen months.</p>
