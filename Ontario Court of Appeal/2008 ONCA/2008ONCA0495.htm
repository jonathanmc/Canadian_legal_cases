    February 20, 2004, Leaman J.P. convicted the applicant of failing to take
    all reasonable precautions in the circumstances for the protection of one
    of its workers in the workplace contrary to s. 25(2)(h) of the <i>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1. As particularized, the charge
    was that the applicant failed to take the reasonable precaution of ensuring
    that a worker working on pavement and exposed to vehicular traffic “prepared
    and implemented an adequate traffic control plan, consisting of flaggers
    and/or signs and/or traffic cones.” The particulars also stated, “a worker
    was injured.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Justice of the Peace found that the actions of the applicant’s workers amounted
    to a construction project within the meaning of the <i>Occupational Health
    and Safety Act</i>. Further, because s. 67 of Ontario Regulation 213/91,
    enacted under the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> concerning construction
    projects, required the applicant to “develop in writing and implement a traffic
    protection plan”, he concluded that the issue of whether it was reasonable
    in the circumstances for such a plan to be prepared and implemented was “moot”.
    Following conviction, the Justice of the Peace imposed a $20,000 fine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the provincial offences appeal court, Pelletier J. upheld the conviction
    and sentence. In relation to conviction, although she agreed with the analysis
    in the court below, she also found that, because of the high volume of truck
    traffic in the area where the worker was injured, the preparation and implementation
    of a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances.
    In relation to sentence, she concluded that the Justice of the Peace had
    considered all relevant factors and that the fine imposed was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant asks for leave to appeal the conviction and sentence to this court
    under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. P. 33. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant submits that the Justice of the Peace and the provincial offences
    appeal court judge erred in law in holding that because of the mandatory
    regulatory requirement it was unnecessary, in order to convict, to conduct
    an analysis of whether a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution
    in the circumstances. In addition, the applicant claims that the sentence
    imposed was harsh and unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> sets a high threshold for granting
    leave to appeal, requiring that an applicant establish: i) special grounds;
    ii) a question of law alone; and iii) that in the particular circumstances,
    it is essential in the public interest or for the due administration of justice
    that leave be granted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, in my view, this is not an appropriate case in which
    to grant leave to appeal the conviction. The applicant did not pursue its
    request for leave to appeal the sentence in oral argument and given the high
    threshold for granting leave to appeal I see no merit in that aspect of the
    applicant’s request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 7, 2001, a worker employed by the applicant was hit by a truck
    as it made a wide turn out of a scale area at a mill in Thunder Bay. At the
    time he was injured, the worker was painting lines on pavement, preparing
    to patch it. The worker was experienced. Although he had a flagger, traffic
    cones and work-in-progress signs with him, he was not using these safety
    devices when he was hit because he was in the process of deciding where to
    put them. He began painting the area where he was injured before positioning
    the safety devices because the location was off the roadway, it was a thirty
    second to one minute job, and he thought that it was safe. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Relevant Legislation</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    25(1) and 25(2)(h) of the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>25. (1) An employer shall ensure that,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the equipment, materials and protective
    devices as prescribed are provided;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the equipment, materials and protective

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) the equipment, materials and protective

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) a floor, roof, wall, pillar, support or

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>25. (2) Without limiting the strict duty imposed

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                            …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(h) take every precaution reasonable in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    67(4) of Regulation 213/91 enacted under the<i> Occupational Health and Safety
    Act</i> states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>67. (4) Every employer shall develop in writing
    and implement a traffic protection plan for the employers’ workers at a project
    if any of them may be exposed to a hazard from vehicular traffic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Reasons of the Justice
      of the Peace</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    setting out the elements of the offence, the Justice of the Peace noted that
    the contentious issue was “whether it was reasonable in the circumstances
    that Bruno’s workers prepare and implement a traffic control plan, consisting
    of flaggers and or signs and, or traffic cones at this particular worksite.” In
    reviewing the facts, he observed that the injured worker and his flagger
    had merely “a nodding acquaintance” with the Ministry of Labour’s Ontario
    Traffic Control Manual, book seven. In addition, he noted that s. 2.1 of
    the Manual provides that in preparation for work, a traffic control plan
    should be prepared “in detail appropriate to the complexity of the work project”.
    This section further provides that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>for minor projects, this plan may be primarily
    the selection of appropriate, typical layouts. Ensure that the plan is understood
    by all responsible parties before the site is occupied. Any changes in the
    traffic control plan should be approved by an authorized individual/person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    Justice of the Peace found that “no one from Bruno’s prepared a written traffic
    protection or control plan with respect to this worksite” and that “none
    was implemented.” After noting that the injured worker’s supervisor opined
    in his evidence that it would take longer to prepare such a plan than for
    the workers to do the work, the Justice of the Peace observed that the construction
    industry is highly regulated and that protective legislative provisions are
    to be interpreted in a manner that is in keeping with its objectives and
    purposes. He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Bearing that in mind the issue of whether it was
    reasonable, in the circumstances for such a plan to be prepared and implemented
    by Bruno’s is moot. It is required by the regulation that applies to the
    work engaged in at the site.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Reasons of the Provincial
      Offences Appeal Court Judge</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provincial offences appeal court judge held that, “[r]ead together, s. 25(2)(h)
    of the [<i>Occupational Health and Safety</i>] <i>Act</i> and s. 67(4) of
    Ontario Regulation 213/91 creates a duty on employers in construction projects
    involving vehicular traffic hazards to plan and implement a traffic control
    plan.” Further, she stated, “[g]iven that a traffic control plan was a mandatory
    regulatory requirement it would be an absurd situation to come to a conclusion
    that it was not a reasonable precaution in the circumstances involving a
    construction project and vehicular traffic.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provincial offences appeal court judge also made an alternative finding that
    a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances.
    She said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence was also that it was an extremely
    busy pulp mill site with extensive movement of tractor trailer units and
    other motor vehicles moving through the site. The circumstance in which [the
    injured worker] was conducting his work was not a routine situation of vehicular
    traffic, for example, a residential street. It was a high traffic, very busy
    pulp and paper mill that, in my opinion, was a dangerous and challenging
    commercial work environment for asphalt workers and one which required more
    than the routine approach to traffic control. <i>The circumstances required
    a well thought out traffic control plan that was implemented and properly
    supervised.</i> <i>I am of the view that given the level of vehicular hazard
    in this commercial setting a traffic control plan was reasonable and should
    have included the actual implementation of traffic cones, a flagger, barriers,
    signage and perhaps a traffic control person.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>I am of the opinion that even in the absence
      of the mandatory requirements of section 67(4) of Regulation 213/91, the
      evidence supports a finding of guilt under s. 25(2)(h) and the alleged
      particulars</i>. Any traffic control planning of the appellant was inadequate
      and not implemented…. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><b>Position of the Applicant</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <i>R. v. Brampton Brick Ltd.</i> (2004), 189 O.A.C. 44, the applicant
    submits that “the circumstances” are an element of the offence under s. 25(2)(h)
    of the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> that must be considered
    before concluding that a precaution was reasonable. The applicant contends
    that the Justice of the Peace and the provincial offences appeal court judge
    erred in law when they found that because s. 67(4) of Regulation 213/91 requires
    an employer to create a traffic protection plan, it was unnecessary to conduct
    any analysis of whether a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution
    in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the applicant relies on its position at trial that a traffic protection plan
    was not a reasonable precaution in the circumstances. At trial, the applicant
    argued that where, as here, the job was of brief duration, the injured worker
    was experienced, and a flagger and safety equipment were provided but not
    used, requiring a traffic protection plan is unreasonable and would create
    a “totally unfeasible” industry. Simply put, the applicant submitted that
    traffic protection plans are not necessary, practical or financially viable
    for small projects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    applicant also submits that the trial judge and the provincial offences appeal
    court judge erred in failing to consider whether the absence of a traffic
    protection plan had anything to do with the accident. In this respect, the
    applicant relies on evidence from the injured worker that he believed the
    truck driver who hit him saw him and that earlier that day he saw that some
    of the truck drivers on site failed to obey the flagger and engaged in risky
    driving due to impatience with the work crew.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Position of the Respondent</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the respondent did not press its position that the Justice
    of the Peace considered all of the circumstances in deciding whether preparing
    and implementing a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution in
    the circumstances, or its position that the courts below were correct in
    holding that it would be absurd to conclude that a mandatory regulatory precaution
    was unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the respondent submitted that the legal issue raised by the applicant concerning
    the necessity of assessing whether a traffic protection plan was a reasonable
    precaution in the circumstances does not warrant granting leave to appeal
    for two reasons: i) it is not an issue that arises frequently, and ii) on
    the facts of this case, it is a hypothetical issue because the provincial
    offences appeal court judge found that preparing and implementing a traffic
    protection plan was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant did not raise any issue in its proposed notice of appeal concerning
    the alternative finding made by the provincial offences appeal court judge,
    and relied on by the respondent, that preparing and implementing a traffic
    protection plan was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances. However,
    in oral argument, I asked the respondent on what basis the provincial offences
    appeal court judge was entitled to make this alternative finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent indicated that its submissions in the provincial offences appeal
    court were premised on the curative proviso contained in s. 120(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>. That section mirrors the proviso contained
    in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>120. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a
    conviction … the court by order,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>                                                   …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) may dismiss the appeal where,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>                                                   …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii) although the court is of the opinion
    that on any ground mentioned in subclause (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided
    in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the provincial offences appeal court judge did not indicate that
    she was applying the proviso when she made the alternative finding. Nonetheless,
    in my opinion, the alternative finding made by the provincial offences appeal
    court judge militates against granting leave to appeal in this case. On the
    evidentiary record, I am satisfied that it was open to the provincial offences
    appeal court judge to dismiss the appeal on the basis that no substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the provincial offences appeal court judge noted, the evidence at trial indicated
    that this was an extremely busy pulp mill site with extensive truck traffic
    in the area where the worker was injured. That in itself was sufficient to
    justify the provincial offences appeal court judge’s conclusion that preparing
    a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution in the circumstances.
    Given the volume and nature of the traffic, the fact that the job was of
    brief duration did not displace the necessity of a traffic protection plan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the fact that the worker was experienced and had, but did not use, the available
    safety measures supports rather than undermines the conclusion that a traffic
    protection plan was a reasonable precaution. A written traffic protection
    plan could only have reinforced the necessity and importance of using appropriate
    safety measures at all times. Finally, particularly in light of the truck
    driver’s evidence that he thought the injured worker was at the scale house
    when the accident occurred, the applicant’s suggestion that the accident
    was solely the result of rogue driving is mere speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    as part of her alternative finding, the provincial offences appeal court
    judge stated that, “[t]he circumstances <i>required</i> a well thought out
    traffic protection plan [emphasis added].” In my view, this statement indicates
    that the provincial offences appeal court judge considered that the finding
    that a traffic protection plan was a reasonable precaution in all the circumstances
    was inevitable. This implicit conclusion is amply supported by the evidence
    and justified applying the proviso. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant asserts that leave to appeal should be granted in any event, because
    this case will otherwise stand for what the applicant asserts is an incorrect
    proposition of law. I reject this argument. In the absence of a presenting
    fact situation in which a traffic protection plan may not be a reasonable
    precaution in the circumstances, I see no basis for holding that it is necessary
    in the public interest or for the due administration of justice that leave
    to appeal be granted. If the legal issue raised is theoretical only, it cannot
    meet the threshold that a decision on the point is “necessary” for any purpose.</p>
