  <h2>I.          INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 draws a distinction between appeals in
    indictable proceedings, which are governed by Part XXI, and applications for
    leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals in summary conviction
    proceedings, which are governed by Part XXVII.  In indictable matters, this court provides the first level of appellate
    review, and this court’s jurisdiction is very broad.  In summary conviction appeal proceedings, the
    Superior Court of Justice is the primary appellate court, and it has the same
    broad jurisdiction.  Access to this court
    from these decisions of the Superior Court is restricted to questions of law
    alone and only if leave to appeal is granted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite the very different statutory provisions
    governing indictable and summary proceedings, the vast majority of summary proceeding
    matters brought to this court proceed as if they were appeals as of right in
    indictable proceeding matters.  By that I
    mean, the court does not address the question of leave to appeal as a discrete
    preliminary issue; rather, it simply lists summary conviction matters for oral
    argument before a panel of the court.  The
    application for leave to appeal and the appeal itself are addressed in the same
    proceeding.  In oral argument, leave to
    appeal is sometimes not even mentioned (much less argued).  Instead, counsel and the court generally proceed
    directly to the merits of the grounds advanced on behalf of the
    applicant/appellant.  Often the argument focuses
    on alleged errors at trial and makes only passing reference to the reasons of
    the summary conviction appeal court.  This
    court’s disposition is almost always based on the merits of the appeal and
    seldom alludes to the leave requirement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this proceeding, Crown counsel raised the
    question of leave to appeal as a separate issue and argued that leave should
    not be granted.  At the outset of oral
    argument, the court heard submissions on this issue from both counsel.  It reserved on the question of leave and heard
    arguments on the merits of the appeal.  At
    the conclusion of those arguments, the court was satisfied, despite Ms.
    Presser’s able argument, that, were this a proper case for leave to appeal, the
    appeal must fail on the merits.  The two
    arguments put before this court were virtually the same as those raised before
    the summary conviction appeal court judge.  This court could see no error in the careful and thorough analysis of
    Eberhard J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having decided that the appeal must fail
    essentially for the reasons given by Eberhard J., this court would routinely
    dispose of the appeal with a brief endorsement.  Instead, the court dismissed the appeal with reasons to follow.  While I briefly address the specifics of this
    appeal, the primary intent of these reasons is to set out the basis upon which
    leave to appeal should be decided and to raise concerns that the present
    process should perhaps be modified to bring it in line with the role assigned
    to this court in summary proceedings.    </p>
  <h2>II.        HISTORY OF THE MATTER</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The history of this case is similar to many of
    the summary conviction appeals heard by this court.  I will review the history briefly as it helps
    explains why this court should consider changing its approach to applications
    for leave to appeal in summary conviction proceedings.  In November 2003, R.R. (sometimes referred to
    as the applicant) was charged with seven offences, all arising out of the
    break-up of his common-law relationship with the complainant, J.R.  The offences allegedly occurred between
    September and November 2003.  R.R. made
    his first court appearance on the charges on November 10, 2003.  He was released on bail two days later. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown elected to proceed summarily on all
    charges.  In September 2004, some ten
    months after R.R.’s arrest, the trial began in the Ontario Court of
    Justice.  Evidence was heard periodically
    over some four days.  On April 22, 2005,
    the trial judge convicted R.R. on four of the charges:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>sexual assault;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>assault;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>threatening; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>criminal harassment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.R. was not sentenced until six months later in
    November 2005.  He received sentences
    totalling six months (plus credit for his brief pre-trial incarceration) to be
    followed by two years probation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.R. immediately appealed to the Superior Court
    of Justice.  The appeal was argued over
    two days in February and March 2007.  Eberhard J. dismissed the appeal in reasons dated March 27, 2007.  R.R., who had been on bail, surrendered into
    custody shortly after the reasons were released.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>R.R. commenced an application for leave to
    appeal to this court in April 2007.  He
    secured his release on bail pending this court’s disposition.  In keeping with the afore described practice
    of this court, the application for leave to appeal and the appeal were
    scheduled and heard together by a panel of this court on May 7, 2008 – four-and-a-half
    years after R.R. was arrested.  Clearly,
    the proceeding has been summary in name only.</p>
  <h2>III.       THE NATURE OF THIS APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant and J.R. testified at trial.  They gave very different versions of the
    relevant events.  The trial judge
    ultimately accepted most of J.R.’s evidence.  He was satisfied on the totality of the evidence that the Crown had
    proved its case with respect to four allegations.  R.R. was convicted accordingly.  It is unnecessary in these reasons to detail
    those allegations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the Superior Court, counsel for R.R. advanced
    two grounds of appeal.  He submitted that
    Crown counsel’s cross-examination of R.R. was so improper as to result in a
    miscarriage of justice.  Counsel also
    argued that the trial judge failed to address significant inconsistencies and
    flaws in the complainant’s testimony and that this failure led him to
    improperly accept her evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eberhard J. addressed these arguments in clear
    and cogent reasons.  After a detailed
    examination of the Crown’s cross-examination of R.R., she held at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In considering
    not only fairness but the appearance of fairness, a reasonable observer would
    not have a concern that R.R. was unfairly treated though a few questions and
    comments by Crown counsel may have briefly departed from ideal propriety.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eberhard J. also considered, at length, the
    second argument advanced on R.R.’s behalf.  She ultimately held at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Upon examination
    of the evidence of internal inconsistency that the appellant suggests should
    have given rise to a reasonable doubt, I have found that such inconsistency was
    minor, and could only arise as an internal inconsistency upon the contradictory
    evidence of the appellant which was rejected by the trial judge.  The pathway provided by the trial judge in
    his reasons was proportionate to the thin material through which it had to cut.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this court, counsel for R.R. renewed these
    arguments, which had failed in the Superior Court.  I quote from counsel’s overview of her
    position as set out in her factum:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>First, Crown
    counsel’s cross-examination of the appellant was impermissible in law (in four
    different ways) and highly prejudicial.  The impermissible cross-examination (which pervaded the trial) compelled
    a new trial.  Second, there were serious
    internal inconsistencies or flaws in the testimony of the complainant.  The trial judge’s failure to direct himself
    to those inconsistencies or flaws prevented meaningful appellate review and
    constituted reversible error.  As
    discussed below, the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s arguments came down to the application
    of well-settled legal principles to the specific circumstances revealed by this
    trial record.  Counsel essentially asked
    this court to redo the analysis undertaken at the first level of appeal and
    come to a different conclusion.  For
    example, in her argument alleging improper cross-examination by the Crown,
    counsel urged this court to take a different view of the number and seriousness
    of the alleged improprieties in the Crown’s cross-examination than Eberhard J. took.  In characterizing counsel’s submissions as I
    do, I intend no criticism.  These are the
    kinds of submissions that this court routinely considers, and sometimes accepts,
    on appeals in summary conviction proceedings.</p>
  <h2>IV.       FIRST AND SECOND LEVEL
    APPEALS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    justice system in

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  They protect against wrongful convictions and
    enhance the fairness of the process.  The
    benefits afforded by the appellate process, however, come at some cost.  Appeals extend the life of criminal
    proceedings, thereby exacerbating the uncertainty and anxiety the process
    causes to individuals caught up in it.  Most appeals fail and ultimately delay the imposition of the appropriate
    order made at first instance.  Prolonged
    appellate proceedings detract from the timeliness and finality of criminal
    verdicts.  Dispositions in criminal
    matters made in the detached, rarefied climate of the appeal court, years after
    the relevant events, by a court with virtually no connection to the place or
    people affected by the allegation are not the ideal way to resolve criminal cases.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The history of this matter provides a good
    example of the negative effect brought about by a prolonged appellate
    process.  R.R. was convicted and
    sentenced in November 2005.  When this
    matter came before this court in early May 2008, R.R. had yet to serve a
    sentence imposed two-and-a-half years ago.  He was still uncertain as to whether he had been properly convicted and
    when, if ever, he would serve his sentence.  Even if successful, R.R. faced a retrial on criminal allegations that
    occurred more than five years ago.  The
    complainant, who has no say in the appellate process, has lived with the same
    uncertainty.  This court’s practice of
    treating summary proceeding matters as if they were appeals as of right on the
    merits may well contribute to the unsatisfactory length of the post-trial phase
    of some of these summary proceedings.</p>

    of appellate review and the negative effects inherent in that process by
    distinguishing between first and second levels of appeal in criminal
    proceedings.  Access to the former is
    virtually carte blanche.  Access to the
    latter is narrowly restricted.<a href="#_ftn2"

    level of appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada, is very limited.  Most appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada
    in indictable proceedings are governed by ss. 691 to 693 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Except in very limited circumstances (where a
    judge of the Court of Appeal has dissented on a question of law), leave to
    appeal must be obtained from the Supreme Court.  As well, that court’s jurisdiction is limited to questions of law.  The <i>Criminal
    Code</i> does not set out the criteria governing the granting of leave to
    appeal.  In practice, the court grants
    leave only where the proposed questions of law have a significant potential
    impact on the administration of justice beyond the specifics of the case.  As stated in Brian A. Crane and Henry S.
    Brown, <i>Supreme Court of Canada Practice
    2008</i> (

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are no
    statutory criteria for leave in <i>Criminal
    Code </i>cases.  However, leave is likely
    to be granted if there is a significant question of law which affects the
    administration of justice or in relation to which there is conflict between
    provincial courts of appeal.  On the
    other hand, the Court is not likely to grant leave in a case which requires an
    assessment of the evidence or the wording of a charge to the jury.</p>

    appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from some decisions of this court in
    indictable proceedings.  The section
    applies to decisions that do not directly attack the conviction or
    acquittal:  e.g. see <i>R. v. Laba</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965 and <i>R. v. Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.  Like the provision of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, leave to appeal is
    required under s. 40.  Leave may,
    however, be granted on questions of mixed fact and law, as well as on questions
    of law alone.  The language of s. 40
    imposes a high threshold for the granting of leave to appeal.  The Supreme Court may grant leave to appeal
    pursuant to s. 40 only if the issue is one of “public importance” or “of such a
    nature or significance” as to warrant consideration by the court.  </p>

    Superior Court judge has the same broad powers that this court has in
    indictable matters, including the power to receive fresh evidence in
    appropriate circumstances:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 822.  Under the governing Rules of Practice fixed
    by the Superior Court, the procedure for the perfection and hearing of summary
    conviction appeals parallels closely the procedure followed in this court in
    indictable matters.  Just as in this
    court, counsel are responsible for ordering and providing the necessary trial
    transcripts, preparing the requisite appeal books, and filing facta before oral
    argument:  <i>Ontario Court of Justice Criminal Proceedings Rules</i>, S.O.R./1992-99,
    Rule 40.  A Superior Court judge sitting
    on appeal in summary conviction proceedings can conduct a thorough review of
    all aspects of the trial.  If an
    appellant demonstrates prejudicial error, the Superior Court judge is cloaked
    with all the remedial powers necessary to correct that error.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second level of appeal in summary conviction
    proceedings (to this court) is found in s. 839(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The section
    reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A]n appeal to
    the court of appeal as defined in section 673 may, <i>with leave of that court or a judge thereof, be taken</i> <i>on any ground that involves a question of
    law alone</i>, against </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addressing the scope of appellate review
    contemplated by s. 839(1), three aspects of that provision deserve
    emphasis.  First, the appeal is not a
    second appeal from the trial decision; rather, it is an appeal from the
    decision of the Superior Court judge.  Second, the appeal is limited to questions of law alone.  Like the Supreme Court of Canada on
    indictable appeals brought under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions, this court cannot revisit factual findings or correct
    errors of mixed fact and law.  Third,
    even if the applicant raises a question of law arising out of the decision of
    the Superior Court judge, the applicant must still convince this court (or a
    judge of this court) that leave to appeal should be granted on that question of
    law.  Not all questions of law merit a
    second appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These three features of s. 839, all of which are
    found in the corresponding section dealing with leave to appeal to the Supreme
    Court of Canada in indictable matters, make it clear to me that a second appeal
    in summary conviction proceedings should be the exception and not the rule.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no sensible criminal law policy that
    would justify more extensive rights of appeal in relatively minor criminal
    matters than those available in the most serious criminal cases.  As the relevant provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> indicate, this court’s
    role in the appellate process in summary conviction proceedings is similar to
    the role played by the Supreme Court of Canada in appellate proceedings in
    indictable matters.  Both the parallel
    statutory provisions and policy dictate that this court should, in exercising
    its discretion to grant a second appeal in a summary conviction proceeding,
    adopt a similar approach to that taken by the Supreme Court of Canada on
    applications for leave to appeal in indictable offences.  Furthermore, summary proceedings are intended
    to be expeditious.  Routinely granting a
    second full appeal on the merits from the trial decision hardly furthers that
    goal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The requirement that the applicant obtain leave
    to appeal in s. 839 provides the mechanism whereby this court can control its
    summary conviction appeal docket.  Access
    to this court for a second appeal should be limited to those cases in which the
    applicant can demonstrate some exceptional circumstance justifying a further
    appeal.  </p>
  <h2>V.        WHEN SHOULD LEAVE TO APPEAL
    BE GRANTED IN SUMMARY CONVICTION PROCEEDINGS?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 839 appears to give the Court of Appeal
    (or a judge of this court) an unfettered discretion as to when leave to appeal
    should be granted.  Ultimately, that
    discretion must be exercised in the interests of justice:  <i>R. v. Martin</i>,
    [2004] B.C.J. No. 2191 (B.C.C.A.) (Southin J.A. in chambers).  There is no single verbal formulation that
    can capture all of the cases in which it may be ultimately in the interests of
    justice to grant leave to appeal.  That
    said, it is necessary to articulate the factors which should guide the exercise
    of the discretion provided in s. 839.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court has seldom addressed the question of
    leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839.  That
    issue occasionally arises on motions where granting leave to appeal is a
    condition precedent to granting the relief sought on the motion, as for example
    where an applicant/appellant seeks a stay of a driving prohibition pending his
    application under s. 839.  In <i>R. v. Zamfirov</i> (1996), 92 O.A.C. 317 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Carthy
    J.A. was faced with such a motion.  In
    refusing to grant leave to appeal under s. 839, he said at paras. 6-7:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he applicant
    presents fact oriented questions of law which have no general application and,
    while the grounds are not frivolous, it is my opinion that the chances of
    success in setting aside the verdicts is very modest.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This is the type
    of case that should not be treated as one deserving a third hearing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two factors identified by Carthy J.A., the
    significance, beyond the specific case, of the proposed question of law to the
    administration of justice in the province, and the strength of the appeal have
    featured prominently in other provincial appellate court decisions that have
    considered applications under s. 839:  see <i>R. v. Hunt</i> (1998), 108
    B.C.A.C. 218 (C.A.) (Hall J.A. in chambers);  <i>R. v. Breeden</i>, [2008] B.C.J.
    No. 582 (C.A.) (Lowry J.A. in chambers);  <i>R. v. Open Sky Inc.</i> (1996),
    110 Man. R. (2d) 153 (C.A.) (Lyon J.A. in chambers);  <i>R. v.

    broader potential significance of the question of law on which leave is sought
    and the apparent merits (or lack thereof) of the proposed appeal as central
    questions on the application for leave to appeal.  I also find helpful the observation of
    Russell J.A. in <i>R. v. Chaluk</i> (1998),
    237 A.R. 366 (C.A.) at para. 7:<a href="#_ftn4"

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 839 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> confines leave to
    issues of law alone.  <u>Courts have
    further confined leave to matters of public importance.</u>  [Citation omitted.]  <u>This public aspect underscores both the
    insufficiency of mere error, as well as the need to demonstrate the potential
    for significant impact on the administration of justice.</u>  Well settled principles of law do not present

    power to grant leave to appeal in summary conviction proceedings is broad
    enough to reach two quite different categories of cases.  Leave to appeal may be granted where the
    merits of the proposed question of law are arguable, even if not strong, and
    the proposed question of law has significance to the administration of justice
    beyond the four corners of the case.  Leave
    to appeal may also be granted where there appears to be a “clear” error even if
    it cannot be said that the error has significance to the administration of justice
    beyond the specific case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The public interest in granting leave to appeal
    in the first category of case described above is obvious.  It is this court’s function, subject of
    course to decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, to settle questions of law
    of general application.  In doing so, the
    court performs a valuable function for the administration of justice beyond its
    error correcting function in the individual case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The value to the administration of justice in
    granting leave to appeal in the second category of case described above is also
    clear.  Summary proceedings can result in
    criminal convictions that carry strong social stigma and serious penalties,
    including significant incarceration.  The
    interests of justice require that a person who stands convicted of a serious
    criminal offence and has perhaps lost his or her liberty should have access to
    this court to review the merits of that conviction if he or she can show a
    strong likelihood that the conviction was sustained at the first level of appeal
    because of an error in law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The facts of this case can be used to
    demonstrate the operation of the two categories of appeals I have referred to
    above.  The questions of law raised by
    R.R. have no significance beyond this case.  He relies on well-settled legal principles and contends that they were
    improperly applied in the specific circumstances of this case.  Consequently, while the questions of law
    raised by R.R. are arguable, he could not bring himself within the first
    category of case in which leave to appeal would be appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to the second category of case, R.R. has
    been convicted of serious criminal offences that carry a very real stigma.  He also faces a six month jail sentence.  I have no doubt that if he were able to make
    out a strong case that Eberhard J. had made a reversible error in law, this
    would be an appropriate case to grant leave even though the resolution of the issues
    raised on the appeal would have no significance beyond this case.  The arguments advanced on behalf of R.R.,
    while raising arguable issues, do not, in my view, give strong reason to think
    that Eberhard J. may have fallen into reversible error of law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839
    should be granted sparingly.  There is no
    single litmus test that can identify all cases in which leave should be
    granted.  There are, however, two key
    variables – the significance of the legal issues raised to the general
    administration of criminal justice, and the merits of the proposed grounds of
    appeal.  On the one hand, if the issues have
    significance to the administration of justice beyond the particular case, then leave
    to appeal may be granted even if the merits are not particularly strong, though
    the grounds must at least be arguable.  On the other hand, where the merits appear very strong, leave to appeal
    may be granted even if the issues have no general importance, especially if the
    convictions in issue are serious and the applicant is facing a significant
    deprivation of his or her liberty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel should separately address the question
    of leave in their facta and, if necessary, in oral argument.  The specific question or questions of law on
    which leave is sought should be clearly set out.  The factors said to justify the granting of
    leave should also be clearly articulated.  The respondent’s written material should also address separately the
    question of leave as a preliminary issue.  It is also important that the leave application focus on the alleged
    errors made by the Superior Court judge.  To properly fix the focus of the leave application, the material filed
    in this court should include the notice of appeal and the facta filed in the
    Superior Court.  Generally speaking, this
    court should not entertain legal arguments that were not advanced at the first
    level of appeal.</p>

    course.  Applications for leave to appeal
    and the merits of the appeal are addressed at the same time in a single oral
    argument.  In practice, the requirement
    of obtaining leave to appeal is all but ignored except in those cases where
    some preliminary ancillary relief is sought.  In those cases, leave to appeal must be granted by a judge in chambers before

    the application for leave to appeal and the merits of the appeal are heard
    together before a panel, the requirement of leave will fall into
    desuetude.  It is almost impossible to
    avoid the temptation of proceeding directly to the merits.     </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Proceeding as if there was a right of appeal to
    this court on the merits in summary proceedings flies in the face of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It will also, in at least some cases, unnecessarily
    prolong what should be expeditious proceedings.<a

'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Ignoring the leave requirement also gives individuals
    with financial resources a real advantage.  Legal Aid funding for summary proceedings in this court is very limited;
    therefore, persons who can fund their own appeals have a real advantage under
    the present r<span style='"Times New Roman"'>e</span>gime
    in that they get two full appeals.  Finally,
    treating all summary conviction matters as appeals on the merits minimizes the
    significance and value of the role played by the Superior Court in the summary
    proceeding appellate process.  Routinely
    treating appeals in summary conviction proceedings as if they were appeals as
    of right from the trial decision undervalues the review carried out by Superior
    Court judges.    </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The leave requirement in s. 839 can perform its
    proper function only if it is addressed separately from the ultimate merits of
    the appeal.  A separate preliminary
    consideration of the question of leave should also quickly eliminate those
    cases from the system that do not warrant leave to appeal.  In my experience, most summary conviction
    matters brought to this court should fail at the leave to appeal stage.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the court were to separate the application for
    leave to appeal from the hearing of the merits of the appeal, then different
    procedures could be adopted to reflect that bifurcation.  The practice of this court on applications
    for leave to appeal in civil matters from the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court pursuant to s. 6(1)(a)
    of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C-43 is worth considering.  Pursuant to rule 61.03.1(1) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, motions for leave to appeal to this court in civil
    matters are dealt with in writing without oral argument or the attendance of
    the parties unless the court orders otherwise.  The Rule sets out a detailed timetable for the filing of the necessary
    material.  That timetable aims to have
    the material in the hands of the panel who will decide the question of leave
    within ninety days of the decision from which leave is sought.  Leave requests are quickly decided by a panel
    once the material is delivered to the panel.  No reasons are given.  If leave to
    appeal is refused (the result in most motions in civil matters), then the
    matter comes to an end within about four months of the motion being launched in
    this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    costs that may flow from separating the leave application from the hearing of
    the ultimate merits, the potential for additional costs would, of course, apply
    only to those relatively few cases in which leave to appeal is granted.  Presumably, adopting a practice like that
    followed in civil applications for leave to appeal would reduce the costs in
    those cases where leave is not granted.  As
    well, in those cases where leave to appeal is granted, cost increases could be
    minimized by listing those appeals for hearing very quickly after leave is
    granted.  This would substantially reduce,
    if not avoid, the added costs associated with double preparation.  </p>
  <h2>VII.     CONCLUSION</h2>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although this is not a case in which leave to
    appeal should be granted on the standards set out in these reasons, the court
    heard full arguments on the merits of the appeal and indicated after oral
    argument that the appeal failed on the merits.  In those circumstances, I think the appropriate order is to grant leave
    and dismiss the appeal.  </p>

    Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P-33, which provides very broad first level
    rights of appeal in quasi-criminal matters.  Further appeals to this court from the first level of appeal are with
    leave only and leave may be granted only in very limited circumstances:  see s. 131(2) and s. 139(2).</p>

    in summary proceedings set out in s. 830.  This is similar to the old “stated case” procedure and provides for a
    narrower right of appeal than is found in s. 813.  I do not propose to address this right of
    appeal any further.  </p>
