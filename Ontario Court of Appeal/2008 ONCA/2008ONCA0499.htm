    appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to five years incarceration,
    minus fourteen months pre-sentence custody.  He appeals his conviction on
    the basis that the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       subjected the appellant’s evidence to
    a different level of scrutiny from that of the complainant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       erred in finding the appellant’s testimony
    internally inconsistent; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       made gratuitous comments to the complainant,
    which suggested the trial judge had closed his mind to the issue of the complainant’s
    credibility; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       interfered with counsel for the appellant’s
    cross-examination in relation to information contained in a third party record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, the appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence on the basis that
    the sentence was unduly harsh and excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    brief, the conduct in question is as follows.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    February 1999 and September 2000, the appellant was living in a room at the
    Rockwood Hotel.  The complainant and other young teenage boys would periodically
    go to the appellant’s room in search of marijuana.  On one such occasion,
    the complainant went to the appellant’s room alone. The two drank some beer
    and watched TV.  The appellant then gave the complainant some type of pill,
    a drug that made him “sleepy and numb”.  After the drug took effect, the
    appellant engaged in non-consensual sex with the complainant: he performed
    fellatio on the complainant, which was followed by anal intercourse. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first three issues raised on appeal can be dealt with together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the argument that the trial judge scrutinized the appellant’s
    evidence differently from that of the complainant.  In his detailed reasons,
    the trial judge cited <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.)
    and pointed out the strengths and weaknesses in the testimony of each of
    these two key witnesses.  One of the problems in the appellant’s evidence
    that the trial judge noted was that it was internally inconsistent.  The
    evidence supports this conclusion. For example, the appellant provided differing
    versions of the number of times the complainant visited his room and the
    circumstances surrounding those visits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant also cites a gratuitous comment made by the trial judge
    to support his claim of different levels of evidentiary scrutiny.  Specifically,
    he cites an exchange after the complainant had testified where the trial
    judge counselled the complainant not to blame himself for what may have happened
    or what he perceived to have happened.  While counsel did not argue that
    this comment rose to the level of bias, he suggested that it should cause
    this court considerable concern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is clear the trial judge was simply trying to show compassion toward the
    complainant after a particularly difficult part of his testimony, it would
    have been preferable had he resisted expressing his sentiments.  That said,
    the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was aware of the issues in
    contention and that this statement was not relevant to his determination.  The
    trial judge correctly understood that the case turned not on the complainant’s
    credibility but on the reliability of his evidence. The fact that the complainant
    believed the appellant had sexually assaulted him was not the issue.  The
    issue was whether this belief was grounded in actual experience.  Viewed
    in this context, the judge’s comments do not indicate that he prejudged the
    case and does not constitute reversible error.  We would also note that defence
    counsel did not comment on or object to the trial judge’s remarks at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the cross-examination on the statement contained in the third
    party record, we agree with the Crown that the area of cross-examination
    upon which the defence was attempting to embark was not proper as no evidentiary
    foundation had been laid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances surrounding the offence were serious
    – the appellant used drugs to lure the young complainant into his lair, where
    he then plied him with other drugs to facilitate a violent and degrading
    assault.  We see no error in the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we grant leave to appeal the sentence, but dismiss both the conviction and
    sentence appeals.</p>
