    Quidley seeks to set aside his convictions on serious drug-related offences
    which formed part of a larger conspiracy to import cocaine, hash oil, hashish,

    proceedings, at least six others were also convicted of various offences
    arising out of the same circumstances.</p>

    appellant worked as a groomer for Air
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  The investigation into this drug conspiracy –
    Project O’Booker – covered a period of approximately one year and produced
    a large number of intercepted phone calls said to have taken place between
    the appellant and others.  Many of the conversations were conducted in Jamaican
    Patois and had to be translated into English.  These phone calls were central
    to the case against the appellant.  The accuracy of the voice identification
    and the accuracy of the translations from Patois to English were thus key
    components of the trial.  It is the way in which the trial judge dealt with
    these issues in his charge to the jury that is at the heart of the appeal.</p>

    Lockyer also raised a <i>Vetrovec</i> issue in relation to a key Crown witness,

    the nature and scope of the conspiracy and the role of Air
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    in some instances.  We did not call on the Crown with respect to the <i>Vetrovec</i> issue
    and, on the view I take of the appeal, it is not necessary to deal with that
    issue directly.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed on the first ground raised,
    namely that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the burden of proof in
    relation to the voice identification evidence and the accuracy of the translations
    from Patois into English.  This error could not have been overcome by the
    otherwise flawless charge with respect to the burden of proof and reasonable
    doubt.  My reasons for arriving at this conclusion follow.</p>

'>In each case, telephone interceptions of conversations purporting to involve
    the appellant were key to establishing the conviction.  Although large quantities
    of drugs seized over the course of Project O’Booker  were alleged to be linked
    to the conspiracy, none of them were ever directly linked to the appellant.</p>

    total of forty-nine kilograms of cocaine, one hundred and three kilograms
    of hashish, and fifty-five kilograms of hash oil were seized in the course
    of the investigation.  An expert witness testified for the Crown as to the
    value of these drugs and this evidence was not challenged by the defence.  The
    cocaine seized would have generated over $1.3 million if sold by the kilogram,
    $2.07 to $3.11 million if sold by the ounce, and upwards of $12 million if
    sold by the gram.  The hashish would have sold for between $1.03 and $5.12
    million, and the hash oil could have generated $734,000 or more.  It was
    not an inconsequential criminal operation that was foiled.</p>

    of Project O’Booker’s surveillance evidence – except for the September 26,
    2000 incident involving trafficking in cocaine – connected the appellant
    to the crimes.  However, he was alleged to have been a participant in a large
    number of intercepted wiretap conversations concerning the conspiracies.  The
    wiretap connection was central to the Crown’s case on all convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    total of eighty-six intercepted telephone calls were entered into evidence
    against the appellant.  Many of them were conducted in Jamaican Patois and
    required English translation.  While the defence admitted the time, date,
    and place of the calls, the voice identification and the accuracy of the
    translations from Patois to English were hotly contested issues at trial.  In
    this respect, the evidence of two witnesses
    – Jeffrey Cahill and P.C. Williams – was particularly important.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first witness was Jeffrey Cahill.  He was permitted to give voice identification

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    employee and a major participant in the conspiracy.  Shortly before the appellant’s
    trial, he agreed to testify for the Crown against the other alleged members
    of the conspiracy.  In exchange the Crown agreed to – and did –
    stay all charges against Mr. Cahill, including conspiring to import drugs,
    importing drugs, and certain firearms charges arising from his arrest.  The
    agreement between Mr. Cahill and the Crown was filed as an exhibit at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart

    of Air
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    groomers in it, Mr. Cahill listened to the telephone interceptions and testified
    as to the identity of many of the participants, including the appellant.  Indeed,
    the Crown relied upon Mr. Cahill as their sole evidence of voice identification.  When
    the interceptions were played to him in the witness box, Mr. Cahill had the
    transcripts of those conversations in front of him with the alleged speakers
    already identified on the page.  A similar process had been followed prior
    to the date he gave his evidence when he met with Crown counsel and a police
    officer to review the tapes.  Mr. Cahill testified that in almost all of
    the instances in which the appellant was purported by the transcript identification
    to be speaking in the conversations, he was able to identify the appellant’s
    voice.  The defence challenged these identifications, arguing that Mr. Cahill
    had motive to shape his testimony in favour of the Crown and that the resulting
    identifications were particularly dangerous since they lay at the very heart
    of the Crown’s case against the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second witness was P.C. Williams of the Peel Regional Police.  P.C. Williams
    was permitted to provide opinion evidence on the accuracy of the Patois translations
    and testified that the translations were accurate.  The trial judge ruled
    that the jury should also hear the interceptions themselves to listen for
    voice intonation and emotion.  The trial judge instructed the jurors that
    in the case of the English portions of the recordings, the evidence was the
    recordings themselves, and in the case of the Patois portions, the transcripts
    were the primary evidence – so long as they were prepared to rely upon the
    evidence of P.C. Williams.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    the intercepted conversations were critical to the case is apparent from
    the position taken by the defence at trial.  The trial judge heard pre-charge
    submissions from counsel and asked each counsel to provide him with a summary
    of their positions so that he could put them accurately to the jury.  Counsel
    did so, and in his charge to the jury the trial judge gave the summary of
    the defence as provided to him.  The defence raised four points:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown had not proven the voice identification in the phone calls where it
    was alleging the appellant was the speaker;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury should use the translated transcripts with caution because of the frailties
    in P.C. Williams’ knowledge of Patois;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if the jury believed the Crown had proven voice identification and the accuracy
    of the translation, the jury should carefully consider what it was the parties
    to the intercepted conversations were speaking about, i.e. that the subject
    matter of the calls was not clear and that too many assumptions had to be
    made to come to the conclusion that the appellant was definitely talking
    about drugs and airplanes; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if the jury believed the appellant was definitely talking about drugs and
    airplanes, it was more probable than not that the intercepted conversations
    had to do with a plot to steal the drugs from Mr. Cahill rather than with
    a conspiracy to import them into Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    three out of four of the defence’s main points turned on voice identification
    and the accuracy of the translations from Patois to English.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    behalf of the appellant, Mr. Lockyer argues that the trial judge misdirected
    the jurors on the burden of proof by instructing them that in the vital areas
    of voice identification and the accuracy of the translations they need only
    be satisfied on a balance of probabilities.  In so doing, Mr. Lockyer submits,
    the trial judge left it open to the jury, in the circumstances of this case,
    to convict on the basis of that standard of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury – on several occasions – that both voice
    identification and the accuracy of the translations from Patois to English
    were matters that did not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt
    because they were not essential elements of the offence, and that the jurors
    need only be satisfied with respect to those matters on a balance of probabilities.  For
    example, in his jury instructions on the voice identification evidence the
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Voice identification is not something that must be established
    beyond a reasonable doubt because it is not an essential element of the offence.  <i>However,
    for any calls where the identity of the speaker matters,</i> <i>you should
    be satisfied that the speaker has been identified to a probability</i>.  In
    other words, that the evidence establishes that it is more probable than
    not that the speaker is a particular identified individual. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[After reviewing some of the evidence, the trial judge returned to this
    theme.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><i>In any event, it is you that must be satisfied of the voice identification
      on the balance of probabilities – more probable than not – in any case
      where voice identification matters</i>.  You make that determination from
      a consideration of all of the evidence.  Frailties in the voice identification
      go to the weight you are prepared to give the evidence in determining if
      someone’s voice is identified.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now you may
    have noticed that I spoke of voice identification, … ‘where it matters’.  It
    will always matter in the case of Mr. Quidley.  Before you can attribute
    a statement from the wiretap evidence to Mr. Quidley, you must be satisfied
    that he is the speaker who said it.  That is on the balance of probabilities,
    as I said.  Before you can look at the contents of the telephone call as
    evidence admissible directly against Mr. Quidley, you must be satisfied that
    he is a participant in the conversation.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the use of the balance of probabilities standard when determining
    the accuracy of the translations, the trial judge instructed the jury as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[Defence counsel] suggested in her address to you – and this
    is no criticism of her, I just want to make sure you understand something
    properly – that you need to be completely satisfied as to the translation.  I
    want you to understand that the accuracy of the translation is not something
    that must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is because it is
    not an element of the offence.  <i>Before relying on the translation of a
    call or calls it is sufficient if you are satisfied that the translation
    is probably accurate</i>.  <i>That is, that it is more probable than not
    that the translation is accurate.</i>  Aside from that, any deficiencies
    that you may find in the translation process are matters which go to the
    issue of the weight you will give the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>So with respect to the transcripts, for English they may be used to the
    extent you find they are accurate.  If there are differences, rely on the
    recording.  For Patois, the transcripts are the primary evidence, provided
    you are prepared to accept and rely upon the opinion evidence of Constable
    Williams as to the probability of the accuracy of the translation. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    deliberations the jury posed a question to the trial judge: “Is the transcript
    agreed to be an accurate representation of the wiretaps?”  The trial judge
    was concerned about this question, as he thought it might have meant that
    the jury had fundamentally misunderstood his earlier instructions.  After
    discussions with counsel, he re-charged the jury in essentially the same
    terms as he had previously done.  He resisted the Crown’s suggestion at that
    time to provide the jury with his written charge, but ultimately he did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    behalf of the Crown, Mr. Wilson does not seek to support the trial judge’s
    use of the balance of probabilities standard in relation to the charge respecting
    voice identification and the accuracy of the translation.  Indeed, he concedes
    there is nothing in the case law to justify it.  He submits, however, that
    the trial judge gave an otherwise solid charge on the burden of proof and
    reasonable doubt and that upon a review of the whole of the charge, there
    is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct standard
    of proof – namely, proof of guilt on all counts beyond a reasonable doubt:
    see <i>R. v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para. 233 (S.C.C.); <i>R.
    v. Rhee</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 32 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Bisson</i> (1998),

    this respect, the Crown places considerable emphasis on the portions of the
    charge where the trial judge stated that deficiencies or frailties in the
    voice identification or the accuracy of the translations go to the weight
    of that evidence.  The trial judge followed most of his references to the
    balance of probabilities standard with respect to voice identification and
    the accuracy of the translation with this instruction.  The trial judge used
    language to this effect:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    process are matters which go to the issue of the weight you will give to
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You make that
    determination [i.e. the determination of voice identification on the balance
    of probabilities] from a consideration of all of the evidence.  Frailties
    in the voice identification go to the weight you are prepared to give the
    evidence in determining if someone’s voice is identified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in responding orally to the above mentioned question from the jury
    about the accuracy of the translations, the trial judge told the jury: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As long as you’re
    able to say from the evidence … that the interpretation is probably accurate,
    you can take it into account and consider any frailties or whatever you think
    it has and give it the weight that you determine you should give it in your <i>overall</i> assessment.

line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is the closest the trial judge came to directing the jury that, having been
    satisfied about the voice identification and the accuracy of the translations,
    they must nonetheless still consider that evidence as part of their overall
    assessment of the evidence on a beyond a reasonable doubt basis.  The Crown
    fairly acknowledges, however, that the latter instruction was part of the
    oral re-charge, whereas the original flawed language regarding balance of
    probabilities was included in the original charge and in the copy of the
    written charge that was later – also in the midst of deliberations – given
    to the jurors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the end, the Crown submits that the foregoing caveats, coupled with the language
    of the model <i>Lifchus</i> charge, were sufficient to ensure that the jury
    did not misapprehend the Crown’s overall burden to prove the appellant’s
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Crown points to the following general
    language, in particular: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'><i>It is not enough for you to believe that an accused is probably
      or likely guilty</i>.  In those circumstances you must find the accused
      not guilty because Crown counsel would have failed to satisfy you of guilt
      beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>Proof of probable or likely guilt is not
      proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Absolute certainty is a standard of proof that is impossibility high.  However,
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt falls much closer to absolute certainty than
    to proof of probable or likely guilt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>If, at the end of the case, <i>after considering all of the evidence, you
      are sure</i> that the accused committed an offence, you should find him
      guilty of it since you would have been satisfied of guilt of that offence
      beyond a reasonable doubt. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the particular circumstances of this case, it constituted reversible error
    on the part of the trial judge to charge the jury as he did with respect
    to the evidence of voice identification and the accuracy of the translations.  In
    my view, there was a very serious likelihood that the jury would be confused
    and would misapprehend the correct standard of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    voice identification evidence and the evidence of P.C. Williams respecting
    the accuracy of the translations were pivotal to the case.  Without the jury
    deciding that it was the appellant’s voice they heard on the tapes and that
    P.C. Williams’ translation of those conversations was accurate, the Crown
    had no case against the appellant.  If the jury decided in the Crown’s favour
    on those questions, there was every likelihood the appellant would be convicted,
    as indeed he was.  These two areas of evidence – while not essential elements
    of the offences charged – were sufficiently central to the determination
    of the case that they were, for practical purposes, almost the same as essential
    elements on this record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge focused on the point that neither the voice identification nor
    the accuracy of the translations was an essential element of the offence.  Accordingly,
    he instructed the jurors that these matters need not be established beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  There was no error in that direction in itself.  However,
    his decision to instruct the jurors that they must be satisfied on these
    matters on a balance of probabilities, and the manner in which he put it
    to them, were problematic.  It left the jurors with the impression that,
    once they had determined on a balance of probabilities (a) that Mr. Quidley
    was the speaker who said what was said on the wiretap, and (b) that the translation
    of that conversation was accurate, that was the end of the exercise respecting
    those pieces of evidence.  In effect, the jurors were told to make a <i>finding</i> with
    respect to them and were then asked to incorporate their probability finding
    as a fact in their decision on reasonable doubt.  The jurors were not told
    clearly that they must consider the voice identification evidence and the
    evidence respecting the accuracy of the translation – together with all of
    the other evidence – in determining whether that evidence, or any of the
    other evidence, raised a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    danger is apparent from the following passage of the charge, for example:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>In any event, <i>it is you that must be satisfied of voice identification
      on a balance of probabilities </i>– more probable than not – in any case
      where voice identification matters.  You make <i>that</i> determination
      from a consideration of all of the evidence.  Frailties in the voice identification
      go to the weight you are prepared to give to the evidence <i>in determining
      if someone’s voice is identified</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Now you may have noticed that I spoke of voice identification … ‘where
    it matters’.  It will always matter in the case of Mr. Quidley.  <i>Before
    you can attribute a statement</i> <i>from the wiretap evidence to Mr. Quidley,
    you must be satisfied that he is the speaker who said it.</i>  <i>That is
    on a balance of probabilities…  </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s other instructions on voice identification and the accuracy
    of the translations leave the same impression.  The instructions tell the
    jurors that once they are satisfied – on a balance of probabilities – that
    the voice identified is the appellant’s (or, in other instances that the
    translation from Patois to English is accurate), they may attribute the statement
    on the wiretap to the appellant (or consider the translation accurate).  There
    is nothing left, then, to consider on a reasonable doubt basis with respect
    to those issues.</p>

    law makes it clear (a) that jurors are not to address the evidence piecemeal
    and seek to apply the criminal standard to separate pieces of evidence before
    doing so to the evidence as a whole (see <i>R. v. Morin </i>(1988), 44 C.C.C.
    (3d) 193 at 210-211 (S.C.C.)), and (b) that jurors are not to examine evidence
    in two separate stages, first sifting out facts they find to be true and
    reliable and then, in a second stage, using only those facts to reach their
    verdict (see <i>R. v. Miller </i>(1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 517 at para. 70 (Ont.
    C.A.)).</p>

    210-211 Sopinka J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The argument in favour of a two-stage application of the criminal
    standard has superficial appeal in theory but in my respectful opinion is
    wrong in principle and unworkable in practice.  <i>In principle, it is wrong
    because the function of a standard of proof is not the weighing of individual
    items of evidence but the determination of ultimate issues</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The concern which proponents of the two-stage process express is, that
    facts which are doubtful will be used to establish guilt.  The answer to
    this concern is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  If facts
    which are essential to a finding of guilt are still doubtful notwithstanding
    the support of other facts, this will produce a doubt in the mind of the
    jury that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>I conclude from the foregoing that the facts are for the jury to determine
    subject to an instruction by the trial judge as to the law.  While the charge
    may and often does include many helpful tips on the weighing of evidence
    such as observing demeanour, taking into account the interest of the witness
    and so forth, the law lays down only one basic requirement: during the process
    of deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the evidence
    as a whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  This of necessity requires that each element
    of the offence or issue be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Beyond this
    injunction it is for the trier of fact to determine how to proceed…. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The reason we
    have juries is so that lay persons and not lawyers decide the facts.  To
    inject into the process artificial legal rules with respect to the natural
    human activity of deliberation and decision would tend to detract from the
    value of the jury system.  Accordingly, it is wrong for a trial judge to
    lay down additional rules for the weighing of the evidence.  Indeed, it is
    unwise to attempt to elaborate on the basic requirement referred to above.  I
    would make two exceptions.  <i>The jury should be told that the facts are
    not to be examined separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal
    standard</i>.  This instruction is a necessary corollary to the basic rule
    referred to above.  Without it there is some danger that a jury might conclude
    that the requirement that each issue or element of the offence be proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt demands that individual items of evidence be so
    proved. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Miller</i> at
    para. 70 this Court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the present
    case, the impugned direction did not instruct the jury to apply proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt in two stages.  In our opinion, however, it was a misdirection
    to instruct the jury to examine the evidence in a first stage, to eliminate
    all evidence except that which the jurors accepted as true and reliable (a
    lower standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt), and then to consider
    only the residual in arriving at their verdict.  This involved the injection
    of artificial rules for the jury and constituted “an intrusion into the province
    of the jury”.  We believe it is wrong and prejudicial to confine the jury,
    in their initial findings of fact, to evidence accepted as true and reliable;
    evidence which is neither rejected nor accepted should survive to the final
    stage of the jury’s determination on the crucial application of reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the specific circumstances prevailing in <i>Morin</i> or <i>Miller</i> do
    not arise in this case, the fundamental danger underlying the reasons in
    those cases is inherent in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  Those
    cases stand for the proposition that jurors are not to apply the standard
    of proof to individual pieces of evidence on a piecemeal basis and then use
    only the evidence that meets that standard to arrive at their verdict.  This
    is for fear that such an approach will skew the jury’s ultimate determination
    of the overall application of reasonable doubt.  The concern is that this
    skewing may occur either by jurors rejecting evidence altogether that might
    be capable of giving rise to a reasonable doubt, or by accepting evidence
    at an earlier stage and not considering it further.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, one of the concerns is that the jurors may have accepted certain
    evidence on a balance of probabilities, thus removing any potential concerns
    about that evidence from their consideration of guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  By instructing the jurors that they should first determine the important
    issues of voice identification and the accuracy of the translations on a
    balance of probabilities standard without making it clear that the jurors
    then had to consider whether on <i>all</i> of the evidence – <i>including
    the voice identification and translation evidence</i> – a reasonable doubt
    was raised in favour of the accused, the trial judge effectively did the
    same thing, in my view.  The trial judge should not have referred to the
    balance of probabilities standard in the way he did.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Telling
    the jury to apply a lower standard of proof to individual pieces of evidence
    was an error, particularly, in the circumstances of this case, where voice
    identification and the accuracy of the translations were so critical to the
    conviction or acquittal.  These two issues were central to three out of four
    of the lines of defence put to the jury on the appellant’s behalf.  Some
    measure of the importance of the instructions, and of the role played by
    the wiretap evidence, is the fact that the appellant was acquitted on the
    only count where wiretap evidence was not a factor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    risks of leaving the jury with the instructions they received were amplified
    by a number of other factors in this case, as well.  First, the only voice
    identification evidence came from a <i>Vetrovec</i> witness – Mr. Cahill – who
    had much to gain from currying Crown favour.  The jury was told to address
    this evidence on the lower standard of balance of probabilities in relation
    to the one issue (voice identification) where his evidence incriminated the
    appellant.  Moreover, voice identification evidence requires careful consideration
    itself because of its inherent frailties, much like eyewitness testimony:
    see <i>R. v. Rowbotham (No. 4),</i> [1977] O.J. No. 1686 at para. 46 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Co. Ct. J.), Borins J.  Secondly, the jurors were given copies of the trial
    judge’s written instructions part way through their deliberations and after
    they had asked a key question about whether the transcripts were agreed to
    be an accurate representation of the wiretaps – thus fortifying the earlier
    misdirection.  Finally, the trial judge allowed the Crown to file a chart
    with the jury
    – not as evidence but for their assistance only – that listed all of the
    calls where the appellant had been “identified” as one of the callers, thereby
    enhancing the likelihood that the crucial question of the appellant’s voice
    identification would be determined decisively on the balance of probabilities
    standard.</p>
