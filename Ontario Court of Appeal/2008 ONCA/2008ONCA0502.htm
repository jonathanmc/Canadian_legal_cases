    a trial by judge alone, the appellant appeals his convictions for operating
    a motor vehicle while disqualified, possession of a loaded restricted firearm
    without authorization, possession of a firearm while prohibited and careless
    storage of a firearm.  He received a global sentence of five years (minus
    the equivalent of 2 years pre-sentence custody calculated on a 2:1 basis).  He
    appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the conviction appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred in failing to find a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable
    search and seizure pursuant to section 8 of the <i>Charter </i>and in failing
    to exclude the evidence under 24(2).  The appellant also alleges that the
    trial judge erred in his reasons for convicting the appellant by improperly
    rejecting the appellant’s evidence.  Finally, the appellant appeals against
    his sentence alleging that it was harsh and excessive.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the car he was driving became the target of surveillance being
    conducted by members of the Urban Organized Unit (“Unit”).  Initially, the
    police followed the appellant with the intention of stopping him for “information
    purposes”.  He was understood to be associated with the
    “Flagstaff Young Assassins”, a gang linked to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Flagstaff Road and
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

 w:st="on">
    Jane Street area in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  During the course of surveillance, the appellant committed at least
    one <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> (“<i>H.T.A.</i>”) infraction and was stopped.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    confronted by two uniformed officers, the appellant refused to identify himself.  Section
    33(3) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, provides that
    a person who is unable or refuses to surrender his or her licence in accordance
    with a demand by a police officer shall, when requested by a police officer,
    give reasonable identification of himself or herself.  A person who fails
    to comply may be arrested without a warrant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two uniformed officers arrested the appellant.  They then searched the appellant’s
    car purportedly to find identification.  Eventually, the officers found a
    loaded, .45 calibre firearm behind the rear passenger seat of the vehicle.  No
    identification was found.  The police officers then re-arrested the appellant
    for possession of a firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    his trial, the appellant brought a motion pursuant to sections 8, 9, 10 and
    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> to exclude the gun.  The main thrust of the appellant’s
    argument was that the police knew the identity of the appellant, that his
    detention and arrest were arbitrary and that the police used the <i>H.T.A.</i> as
    a pretext to investigate the appellant and his car because of an alleged
    gang association.  The trial and the <i>Charter</i> motion proceeded in blended
    fashion.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s argument that the search of his car
    after he was arrested for failing to identify himself was unnecessary because
    the police already knew his identity.  In so-doing he relied on <i>R v. Caprara, </i>[2006]
    O.J. No. 2210.  In that case the court held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We reject the appellant’s argument that the search
    for identification evidence was unnecessary because police already his identity.  The
    trial judge made no such finding.  On the contrary, she found that although
    the police ‘would have been quite certain [who the appellant was]’, they
    were not sure of identity and … this was not a ‘guessing game’.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Similarly, in this case, the trial
    judge found that the officers who conducted the search did not know who the
    appellant was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred because although
    the arresting officers did not know the appellant’s identity, his identity
    was part of the collective knowledge of the Unit.  The evidence with respect
    to the Unit’s collective knowledge is as follows.  D.C. Hayles, a plain clothes
    member of the Urban Organized Crime Unit, was assigned to make observations
    from the parking lot of a high rise apartment building.  He noticed a four
    door Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot of the Community Centre nearby and
    recalled seeing it before.  He notified D.C. Payne over an encrypted radio
    channel and asked him to run a computer check on the vehicle’s licence.  P.C.
    Jackson informed D.C. Hayles that the vehicle was registered to Marcia Jack,
    the appellant’s mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C.
    Jackson also told D.C. Hayles that the vehicle had been investigated seven
    weeks earlier.  At the time the appellant and Mr. Yeboah were the two occupants
    of the vehicle.  P.C. Jackson provided a description of the appellant and
    Yeboah over the radio.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after this D.C. Hayles observed a man approach the vehicle.  P.C. Hayles “recognized”
    the appellant from a poster containing a photograph of 25 individuals believed
    by police to belong to the Falstaff Young Assassins Gang. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    man approaching the vehicle was favouring the right side of his body, indicative
    of concealing something such as a firearm.  The man opened the vehicle with
    a remote and leaned into the rear passenger side door of the vehicle.  He
    then walked around the vehicle, sat in the driver’s seat and began driving
    away.  D.C. Hayles communicated his observations over the air and believed
    it was heard by members of the Unit and assisting officers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.C.
    Payne admitted D.C. Hayles identified the man over the air as Duval Smith.  The
    other officers testified that they did not recall hearing D.C. Hayles transmit
    the appellant’s name over the air.  The police were using two different radio
    channels and the respondent submits that the appellant’s identity may have
    been conveyed over an encrypted radio channel not the divisional channel
    ordinarily used on the car radio. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> D.C.
    Skinner came on the air.  She stated that she wanted uniformed officers to “stop
    and speak with this individual that was in the car to obtain identification,
    find out who the registered owner of the car was, for intelligence information.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.C.
    Payne then instructed D.C. Hayles and assisting uniform officers, Moxam and
    Moore, to follow the appellant’s car.  Both Hayles and Payne also followed
    the appellant in their respective unmarked cars.  While they were following
    the Jeep, it entered an intersection on an amber light which turned red while
    the driver was in the intersection.  The appellant also rolled through a
    stop sign at Jane and Church and failed to signal while changing lanes.  D.C.
    Payne testified that he ordered the marked cruiser to stop the vehicle when
    he saw the Jeep fail to stop at a stop sign.  P.C. Moxam turned his emergency
    lights on to stop the appellant.  The appellant did not stop and the police
    officers continued to follow him with their lights and siren on for approximately
    150 metres.  The appellant turned into a driveway, got out of his car and
    began walking up the walkway to the porch of a house.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the uniformed officers who were present when the appellant was arrested
    for failing to identify himself had ever met or seen the appellant before
    the day in question.  D.C. Skinner’s evidence suggested that she had seen
    the appellant before.  She did not watch the arrest.  Neither did D.C. Hayles.  However,
    D.C. Payne watched the arrest and did not intervene.  He had no communication
    with the arresting officers until after the arrest.  The appellant submits
    that as D.C. Payne knew who the appellant was, the police officers had no
    right to search his car for identification and that the trial judge erred
    by failing to consider the collective knowledge of the team, particularly,
    D.C. Payne. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.C.
    Payne was not asked if he had ever actually seen or met the appellant before
    the day in question.  In any event, the trial judge found that D.C. Payne
    erred in thinking that he learned of the identity of the man who approached
    the car over the radio.  The trial judge’s finding is not unreasonable.  Had
    the police been certain of the appellant’s identity, they could have arrested
    the appellant for driving while disqualified.  This case falls squarely within
    the ratio of <i>Caprara, supra.  </i>We would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h3><i>Whether the search itself was unreasonable </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant argued that the scope of the search of his car exceeded
    what was reasonable in the circumstances.  The trial judge rejected this
    argument.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    a pat down search of the appellant did not reveal any identification, and
    the appellant continued to refuse to provide his name, P.C. Moxam asked the
    appellant if he had any identification in his vehicle.  The appellant replied, “You
    can’t search the car.”  P.C. Moxam and P.C. Jackson began to search the vehicle.  They
    began by searching the glove box, front console, the door flaps, and the
    floor.  The appellant’s baseball cap was on the back seat of the vehicle.  The
    trial judge found that the police only lifted a rear seat when the search
    in “more likely places for locating identification proved fruitless, and
    even then only after noticing that one of the rear seats was not properly
    engaged”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to appreciate that the searching
    officers had exhausted all locations where identification could reasonably
    expect to be found and the search was therefore unreasonable.  We would disagree.  It
    was open to the trial judge to find that the search was a progressive, reasonable
    search and one where identity may be found.  We would reject the appellant’s
    submission that the trial judge erred in holding that his rights under s.
    8 of the <i>Charter </i>were violated.</p>
  <h3><i>The trial judge’s treatment of the appellant’s evidence</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    did not call upon the respondent to argue this ground of appeal as we were
    of the opinion that the trial judge committed no error in rejecting the appellant’s
    evidence.  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The sentence appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the sentence was outside the range of sentences for
    this offender and this offence.  We would disagree.  The appellant had a
    lengthy, serious and related criminal record.  He was subject to weapons
    and driving prohibitions and was in breach of both of them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed. </p>
