  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a clear sunny day on July 26, 1998, shortly before 11:00 a.m., Carol Jones,
    the appellant, was driving her 16-year-old son, Charles, to work.  As they
    travelled down a paved country road, the car collided with a dog.  Ms. Jones
    lost control of the car.  The car hit a tree and Ms. Jones was severely injured.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nearly
    eight years later, at a trial presided over by Justice Belch of the Superior
    Court, a jury found Walter Niklaus, the respondent and the owner of the dog,
    35 per cent responsible for Ms. Jones’s damages and Ms. Jones 65 per cent
    responsible for her loss.  Ms. Jones’s damages were assessed at $664,745.  In
    the result, Ms. Jones received judgment in her favour of $232,660.75 for
    damages and $32,352.51 for prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge ordered Ms. Jones to pay Mr. Niklaus costs in the amount of $65,000
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Jones appeals to this court in respect of the jury’s findings of contributory
    negligence and damages.</p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p><b><i>Evidence Relating to the Collision</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    were four witnesses to the accident: Ms. Jones and her son, Charles, and
    two children, Cassandra and Johnny Niles, who were playing in the front yard
    of their father’s house which was adjacent to the roadway where the accident
    happened.  The
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children’s version of how the accident happened was diametrically opposed
    to that of Mrs. Jones and her son.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    road on which the accident occurred is a two-lane country road in the town
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Newcastle.  The speed limit is 80 kilometres per hour.  As one travels eastbound
    toward the location of the accident, the road is straight with a slight decline.  A
    person driving on that section of the road would have a completely unobstructed
    view of the road in front of him or her.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Jones testified that she was driving eastbound on the country road when a
    dog suddenly came out of nowhere to her left and was charging her vehicle.  Ms.
    Jones said that she made a small corrective manoeuvre to the right to avoid
    the dog.  She was unable to avoid hitting the dog.  Her car hit the shoulder
    of the road, she lost control of it and eventually hit a tree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    also testified that at the time of the accident, she was travelling within
    the speed limit.  She estimated that the time between when she first saw
    the dog on the road and when it came into contact with her car was
    “split seconds”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Charles
    Jones confirmed his mother’s evidence.  He testified that as they drove down
    the road, the dog came out of nowhere.  The dog came into contact with the
    side of the car and then the car went into the ditch and struck a tree.  The
    elapsed time between seeing the dog and impact with the dog was a “split
    second”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Charles
    Jones did not know at what speed the car was travelling.  However, he testified
    that his mother did not go over the speed limit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cassandra
    Niles was 17 years old at the time of trial.  At the time of the accident,
    she was 9 years old and she and her brother, Johnny, were visiting their
    father’s house.  Cassandra Niles went outside to play and was told by her
    stepmother to shut the gate to the driveway.  When she went outside, Mr.
    Niklaus’s dog was in her father’s front yard.  While she was closing the
    gate, the dog ran to the other side of the gate.  The dog then went onto
    the road and she observed a car crest the hill while the dog stood stationary<span
style='color:red'> </span>and directed his head towards the car.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Ms. Niles, the car was travelling fast.  She tried to call the dog off
    the road but he paid no attention to her.  The car struck the dog, swerved
    and went into the ditch.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    February 2002, approximately three and one-half years after the accident,
    Cassandra Niles gave a statement concerning her recollection of the events.  Counsel
    for the appellant cross-examined her on this statement and in particular
    on an opinion she had advanced in the concluding paragraph of the statement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    at the end of the statement, the very last paragraph, and I’ll read it out
    to you, Miss Niles.  “If the lady was going slower, driving in her own lane
    and paying better attention, she would have noticed the dog sooner and would
    have been able to react more calmly to avoid hitting the dog and also going
    into the ditch.  She seemed to just suddenly notice [the dog] Buddy at the
    last second and then to react very quickly and in a panic just before she
    hit him.”  Are those your words?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Those
    are my words.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>So
    you decided when you finished this statement to sum it up in that way?  Is
    that true?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would say so.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I guess that would be my opinion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cassandra
    Niles and her stepmother, Diane Smith, testified that Johnny Niles was inside
    the house at the time of the accident.  However, Johnny Niles, who was 11
    years old at the time of the accident and 18 years old at the time of trial,
    testified that he was in the driveway walking back towards the house.  When
    he was about 20 metres from the road, he heard the brakes squealing on a
    car.  He turned back and saw a car hit the dog and swerve into the ditch
    and hit a tree.  There was an interval of three or four seconds between the
    time he heard the brakes and saw the car hit the dog.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Johnny
    Niles also gave a statement in February 2002 concerning his recollection
    of the accident.  Counsel for the appellant put the following excerpts of
    the statement to Johnny Niles in cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Even having hit the dog, if she [the driver] had
    accepted the impact, and not panicked and turned so suddenly, she still would
    not have lost control of her car.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>She was driving too fast, she was not paying attention
    and she was in the wrong lane when the accident happened.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury heard evidence from a number of people who were familiar with the habits
    of Mr. Niklaus’s dog and his propensity or otherwise to chase cars.  The
    appellant led evidence that the dog had a wheel fetish and chased cars.  Witnesses
    called on behalf of the respondent testified to the contrary.  One witness
    said the dog was well behaved and when he crossed the road, he looked both
    ways.  Another witness who visited Mr. Niklaus’s property two or three times
    a week testified that he never saw the dog interact with cars in any way.  </p>
  <p><b><i>Evidence Relating to Damages</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Jones was badly injured in the accident.  The most severe of her injuries
    was a shattered right leg.  She underwent surgery on her leg and was hospitalized
    for two and one-half months –
    returning home in October 1998.  She received intensive physiotherapy and
    other medical care for more than three years and underwent numerous surgeries.  Although
    she was enrolled part-time in an at-home program at Laurentian University,
    the evidence suggested that Ms. Jones was not fit to return to work or continue
    her academic studies full-time until the end of 2001 or the beginning of
    2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    graduating from high school in 1969, Ms. Jones worked in an administrative
    position at Simpson’s department store for ten years.  She then worked at
    home until 1986.  From 1986 to 1994, she returned to a series of administrative
    jobs.  Over the years, she acquired a number of employable skills including
    book-keeping and a proficiency with computers.  In 1994, having found that
    administrative work had become unfulfilling and unbearable, she enrolled
    as an at-home student at Laurentian University (referred to above) and received
    a B.A. in sociology.  Ms. Jones also had a very positive experience working
    with and teaching children on a volunteer basis at her local Anglican Church
    and at her children’s school.  At the time of the accident, she had been
    accepted at teacher’s college at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    York
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University and was scheduled to begin classes in August 1998.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    two one-year deferments of her enrolment in teacher’s college, Ms. Jones
    was denied a third deferment.  In or around the summer of 2000, she realized
    that her lack of mobility would not permit her to pursue a career as a teacher.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Jones decided to explore a career as a counsellor.  She obtained a second
    B.A. degree in religious studies at Laurentian University and in September
    2003 enrolled in a Master of Divinity / Counselling degree program at
    <st1:PlaceName

    Tyndale
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Toronto at a reduced course load.  It was anticipated that she would complete
    the Master of Divinity program in 2008 and then begin working as a counsellor.</p>
  <h2><i>The Jury Verdict</i></h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of Walter Niklaus, the jury concluded that his dog did not attack
    the car of Carol Jones.  However, the jury found that Mr. Niklaus was negligent
    and provided the following particulars of negligence:</p>

      2 D.L.R. 639, so that ‘the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against
      the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust
      as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole
      and acting judicially could have reached it’. The principle has been re-affirmed

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(1)  <i>Is the Jury’s Finding of Contributory Negligence Unreasonable?</i></h2>
  <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant raises three arguments in support of his submission that
    the jury’s finding of contributory negligence is unreasonable.  First, he
    argues that the jury’s conclusion on this issue cannot stand because the
    trial judge failed, in his charge, to caution the jury regarding the relative
    reliability of children’s evidence.  According to the appellant, since the
    jury’s finding of contributory negligence was based solely on the evidence
    of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children, that finding was unreasonable given this omission in the
    jury charge.  Second, the appellant argues that the jury’s findings that
    Ms. Jones failed to keep a proper lookout and failed to keep proper control
    of her car are also unreasonable because they are based upon lay opinion
    evidence from the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children, taken primarily from their February 2002 statements, referred
    to above.  According to the appellant, since the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children were not qualified to offer these opinions, they were “not
    entitled”
    to give such evidence in the first place or, if they were entitled to give
    the evidence, such evidence should receive no weight. Third, the appellant
    also attacks the jury’s finding that Ms. Jones failed to apply her brakes
    on the basis that it finds no support in the evidentiary record.  For the
    following reasons, I disagree with these submissions and would decline to
    interfere with the jury’s finding of contributory negligence.</p>

    for the appellant submits that prior to the jury charge, trial counsel for
    the appellant requested the trial judge to caution the jury about the reliability
    of children’s evidence and he declined to do so. Counsel for the appellant
    submitted that the trial judge was obliged to accede to this request at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the appellant has fallen short of establishing that the trial judge’s
    failure to charge the jury concerning the reliability of the children’s evidence
    occasioned a “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” justifying a new
    trial under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have great difficulty finding substantial prejudice or a miscarriage of justice
    in this case in the face of the Supreme Court of Canada’s comments in <i>R.
    v. W.(R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, to the effect that children’s evidence
    is not <i>per se </i>less reliable than the evidence of adults.  As McLachlin
    J. stated in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <i>W.(R.)</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The law affecting the evidence of children has undergone … major
    changes in recent years.  The first is the removal of the notion … that the
    evidence of children was inherently unreliable and therefore to be treated
    with special caution.  Thus, for example, the requirement that a child’s
    evidence be corroborated has been removed [see, in the civil context in Ontario,
    s. 18.2(1), <i>Evidence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23] … The repeal of provisions
    creating a legal requirement that children’s evidence be corroborated does
    not prevent a judge or jury from treating a child’s evidence with caution
    where such caution is merited in the circumstances of the case.  <i><u>But
    it </u>does <u>revoke</u> the assumption formally applied to all evidence
    of children, often unjustly, that children’s evidence is always less reliable
    than the evidence of adults </i>… [Citations omitted. Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is the trial judge who is best positioned to determine, in the overall context
    of a civil trial, whether the circumstances merit a specific caution to the
    jury on the issue of a witness’s relative youth at the material time.  In
    the case at bar, the trial judge declined to issue the caution, partly in
    light of the fact that the Niles children had aged considerably since the
    collision, with Cassandra Niles being 17 years old, and Johnny Niles being
    18 years old, at the time of trial.  In my view, this discretionary decision
    on the part of the trial judge is supportable in the overall context of this
    case.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, on several occasions during the course of the trial, the appellant’s
    counsel had the opportunity to warn the jury to be wary of relying on the
    children’s evidence.  For example, the appellant’s counsel at trial had ample
    opportunity to cross-examine the children on issues relating to the fact
    that they were very young at the time of the collision.  Moreover, in his
    closing submissions to the jury, the appellant’s counsel emphasized the general
    frailty of children’s evidence, and asked the members of the jury to approach
    this issue from the perspective of their own life experience:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You also know from your own experience as parents,
    grandparents, aunts and uncles, that young children are impressionable, and
    subject to being influenced by adults and persons in authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Indeed, at the conclusion
    of his charge to the jury, the trial judge summarized the appellant’s position
    at trial on this issue in the following strong terms:   </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The evidence of Cassandra and Johnny Niles must
    be viewed with great caution.  They are recalling events that occurred many
    years ago when they were young children … For both children there is a real
    concern that their recollections [were] influenced by adults or persons in
    authority.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Therefore, the jury was
    alerted to the appellant’s position regarding the potential frailties in
    the children’s testimony.  This, I note, occurred despite the Supreme Court’s
    holding in <i>W.(R.)</i> to the effect that children’s evidence is not <i>per
    se </i>less reliable than that of their adult counterparts.  This also suggests
    that the appellant suffered no substantial prejudice from the trial judge’s
    failure to charge the jury on the issue of the children’s youth at the time
    of the collision.  </p>

    </i>, 2<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>nd</span> ed. (Markham,
    Ontario:  Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1999) at 609.  Counsel notes that at
    the time of the accident, neither Cassandra Niles nor Johnny Niles had any
    driving experience.  They were both under 16 years of age and had never driven
    a car at the time that they gave their statements in February 2002.  Even
    at the time of trial, Cassandra had not yet driven a car.</p>

    Niles children were “not entitled” to offer opinion evidence loses much of
    its force when one considers that this evidence was led through cross-examination
    by the appellant’s own counsel at trial.  See paragraphs 13 and 15 above.  Also,
    as this court noted in <i>Marshall v. Watson Wyatt &amp; Co.</i> (2002),
    57 O.R. (3d) 814 at para. 15, “if no objection is made to the admissibility
    of evidence in a civil trial, an objection on appeal will usually be unsuccessful.”  Although
    the appellant argues that the opinions were only led by his trial counsel
    in the context of a prior inconsistent statement, it was his obligation to
    seek a clear limiting instruction from the trial judge regarding the use
    for which the jury could put this evidence.  I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.      </p>

    for the appellant submits that the jury’s finding that Ms. Jones failed to
    apply her brakes in time or at all is unreasonable.  He submits that at no
    time during the trial did counsel for the respondent suggest to the jury
    that Ms. Jones was negligent because of her failure to apply her brakes in
    time or at all.  However, this allegation was made in the statement of defence
    and the trial judge referred to it in his charge to the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Well another one that they allege was that she failed
    to apply her brakes.  Well the only people that mentioned brakes were the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children.  Johnny said he heard them but you have to determine whether
    he was in the house watching cartoons or out in the yard.  And Cassandra
    said she heard them.  The photographs two days after the accident don’t appear
    to show any skid marks, but I don’t know, there’s no evidence as to whether
    there was rain. … I thought I heard that Diane Smith asked them to wash down
    where the dog had been killed.  Whether that would have any impact if there
    had been skid marks I don’t know.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the above excerpt from the jury charge, counsel for the appellant
    submits:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this review of the evidence, the trial Judge
    recognized that the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Niles children were the only witnesses to give evidence as to the application
    of brakes.  Both children testified that the plaintiff had applied her brakes.  Cassandra
    did so in her February 2002 statement but said at trial that she could not
    recall whether the brakes had been applied.  Johnny Niles testified that
    he heard the brakes for 3-4 seconds prior to the accident.  The jury’s finding
    is inconsistent with the only evidence on this issue.  That particular of
    negligence is therefore unreasonable and significantly undermines the jury’s
    finding that Jones was negligen[t].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept that the evidence of the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niles children is inconsistent with a finding that there was a failure to
    apply the brakes.  However, the finding of negligence on this point is that
    Ms. Jones “failed to apply the brakes <i>in time</i> <i><u>or</u></i> at
    all”.  [Emphasis added.]  In my view, there was evidence from which a jury
    could find that Ms. Jones failed to apply the brakes in time.  If the jury
    believed the evidence of Cassandra Niles that the dog stood stationary in
    an unobstructed position several hundred metres below the crest of the hill,
    that would have been sufficient to ground a finding that Ms. Jones failed
    to apply the brakes in time.
     </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the language of the jury finding could have been more carefully crafted,
    the fact that the jury added the words “or at all” does not, in my view,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in oral argument, counsel for the appellant submitted that the accident could
    not have happened in the way that the jury found.  The only reasonable explanation
    is that the dog charged the car.  Counsel submits that the distance from
    the crest of the hill to the location of the accident is four-tenths of a
    kilometre.  Accepting that the appellant was travelling at 80 kilometres
    per hour, it would have taken the car eighteen seconds to travel that distance.  Counsel
    submits that it was not possible for Ms. Jones to have missed seeing the
    dog in the road for eighteen seconds.  </p>

    is asking us to second guess the jury.  The jury did not accept the appellant’s
    evidence that the dog charged the car.  While eighteen seconds is a long
    time, as already stated, this court cannot interfere with the jury’s verdict
    unless we conclude “it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy
    the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially
    could have reached it.”  See
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>McLean</i><i> v. McCannell, supra</i> at 343.   While there is a certain
    attractiveness to counsel’s argument, I simply cannot conclude that the jury’s

    it, acting judicially.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant concedes that if Cassandra Niles’s evidence is to be accepted
    in its entirety, then the 35/65 percent division of responsibility was appropriate.  He
    also argues that there is a view of the evidence available to the court which
    could lead to a different division of responsibility.  He reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, it is open to this Court to determine that
    the case at trial was not one of diametrically opposed versions of events.  Rather,
    it was open to the jury to accept some of the child’s evidence, but not all
    of it, in arriving at its findings of fact.  In that case, it was open to
    the jury to strip away the more unreliable (and implausible) aspects of the
    child’s evidence (concerning the more adult subject matter of driving, timing,
    etc.) while at the same time accepting her basic assertion that the dog walked
    onto, rather than charged onto, the road.  On that view of the evidence,
    there was a moment of inattention by the plaintiff (consistent with the jury’s
    findings), but something significantly less than the 18 seconds that Cassandra
    would unreasonably attribute to the plaintiff.  Then, given the brief nature
    of the inattention, Carol made the all too human error of over-reacting to
    the situation and losing control of her vehicle, again consistent with the
    finding of the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>On the basis of the above
    analysis, counsel concludes that liability should be divided 75 percent to
    the respondent and 25 percent to the appellant.  </p>

    jury’s decision on apportionment of damages can only be disturbed in exceptional
    circumstances.  See <i>Deshane v. Deere &amp;

    Co., supra,</i> at 238 and <i>Jack (litigation guardian of) v. Kirkrude</i>,
    [2002] O.J. No. 192 at para. 3.  As this court noted in <i>McIntyre v. Gregg </i>(2006),
    274 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 28 at para. 38, in “the absence of a material
    misdirection or non-direction”, an appellate court will not disturb a jury’s
    apportionment decision unless “no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole
    and acting judicially could have arrived at that conclusion.”  The appellant
    has failed to convince me that such interference is justified in this case.   </p>

    do not agree that, on the issue of apportionment, there is a useful distinction
    in this case between the “basic assertion”
    in Cassandra’s evidence and the portions of her evidence relating to the “adult
    subject matter of driving, timing <i>etc.</i>”   In my view, the aspect of
    Cassandra Niles’s evidence most relevant to apportionment was her position
    that the dog stood stationary on the road during the entire time that Ms.
    Jones’ car travelled from the crest of the hill to the scene of the collision.  This
    core aspect of Cassandra Niles’s evidence – which was the “basic assertion” in
    her testimony –
    is diametrically opposed to the evidence of Ms. Jones and her son.  It firmly
    grounds the jury’s apportionment of damages without necessary resort to “implausible
    aspects of the child’s evidence concerning the more adult subject matter
    of driving, timing, <i>etc</i>.”</p>

    theory as to how the court could come to a 75/25 percent split in favour
    of the appellant would involve the court re-trying the issue, which is an
    impermissible course to follow.  Even if I was prepared to accept that Cassandra
    Niles’s evidence can be divided as the appellant has suggested, it is trite
    law that a jury is entitled to rely on all of a witness’s evidence; the jury
    in this case was entitled to rely on all of Cassandra Niles’s evidence in
    apportioning liability.  Although I may well have come to a different apportionment
    of the responsibility for this accident, the appellant has failed to point
    to “exceptional circumstances” that could justify appellate interference.    </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of mitigation, the appellant’s position at trial was twofold.  First,
    she argued that the respondent had failed to prove that she could have found
    administrative work in 2002 even if she wanted to.  In other words, she attacked
    the respondent’s position that she <i>could</i> have earned $40,000 per year
    starting in 2002, had she been prepared to accept administrative work.  Second,
    she also argued that her own interests were important and that she acted
    reasonably by pursuing a master’s degree and counselling career rather than
    undertaking administrative work that she found unbearable.  In this context,
    the trial judge gave what he described as the “standard charge” on mitigation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[237]   When a plaintiff is wronged, he or she is
    required to act reasonably to mitigate or lessen the loss.  No damages are
    recoverable for any loss that Carol Jones could have avoided through reasonable
    action.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[238]   In this case you must decide whether Carol
    Jones could have pursued job opportunities more actively.  On this issue
    the burden of proof rests with Walter Niklaus.  Walter Niklaus must prove
    on the balance of probabilities that Carol Jones did not act reasonably.  Merely
    suggesting some other course that Carol Jones might have followed is not
    good enough.  Criticism of Carol Jones, her conduct, by Walter Niklaus must
    be viewed with caution as you may decide that it was Walter Niklaus who was
    responsible for these damages.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[239]   Carol Jones is not held to a high standard
    of conduct in mitigation.  The law is satisfied if Carol Jones takes steps
    that a reasonable person would take in the circumstances to reduce the loss.  Whether
    Carol Jones did act reasonably to reduce her damages is a question of fact
    for you to decide.  If Walter Niklaus satisfies you that Carol Jones did
    not act reasonably you must not award Carol Jones compensation for any losses
    which could have been avoided had she acted reasonably to reduce the damages.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[240]   Now upon reflection, and you may find that
    there are other things that you would have considered in this area, but I
    suggest that you may want to have reviewed when everybody said the active
    treatment period had ended.  And you may want to look at, were there any
    jobs available, such as the $40,000 job that the defendant suggests she should
    have taken beginning in September of 2002.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of the charge, trial counsel for the appellant took issue
    with the sufficiency of the last passage from the charge on mitigation:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… Your Honour, you explained to the jury that one
    issue they would have to consider is when the plaintiff was physically and
    emotionally able to return to work.  A second issue for them to consider
    was whether or not when she was able to return to work were there any jobs
    available to her.  There is a third issue which I would ask that the jury
    be instructed on, and that is they could answer yes to those two questions,
    or two issues, but if they considered that the plaintiff’s vocational plans
    were reasonable, they could conclude that she has fulfilled her duty to mitigate.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge declined to re-charge
    the jury on the basis that his charge on mitigation was sufficient.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant on appeal argues that the trial judge misdirected the jury
    on mitigation by failing to instruct the jury that the appellant’s interests
    should play an “important role” on this issue.  Instead, counsel submits
    that the judge emphasized the appellant’s ability to obtain employment in
    2002.  The jury charge ignored her concern that administrative jobs had become
    unbearable and that counselling was an appropriate alternative to a teaching
    job which she was denied as a result of her injuries caused by the respondent.  </p>

    I understand the position of counsel on appeal, he does not take issue with
    the abstract statements of law contained in the first three paragraphs of
    the charge on mitigation.  Instead, according to counsel for the appellant,
    because the fourth paragraph of the charge “was skewed towards a consideration
    of [Ms Jones’] ability to obtain alternative employment in 2002, as proposed
    by the defendant [at trial]”, the trial judge was obliged to go further and
    instruct the jury that the appellant’<span lang=EN-US>s vocational interests
    were also important.  Without this clarification, the appellant submits,
    the jury was misdirected on mitigation.  </span></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    relies on this court’s reasons for judgment in <i>Talon v. Whalley</i> (1988),
    63 O.R. (2d) 723.  In that case, the plaintiff was injured while riding his
    bicycle.  At the time of the accident, he was due to become an apprentice
    gas fitter.  Due to his injuries, he could not do heavy labour and was not
    able to take up the apprenticeship.  He decided that he would pursue a career
    as an optometrist which would take nine years of study and two degrees before
    he qualified.  The trial judge assessed his damages on the basis of nine
    years’ lost income as a gas fitter.  This court, on appeal, found it was
    not reasonable to compensate the plaintiff for lost income while pursuing
    a nine-year professional course of study leading to a career that the plaintiff
    had no intention or expectation of achieving before the accident. However,
    this court held that compensation at the gas fitter rate for a period of
    three years while the plaintiff obtained his Bachelor of Science degree was
    reasonable in the circumstances.  According to this court (at p. 726), in
    mitigating damages, a plaintiff “<i>is bound to act with the defendant’s
    interest in mind as well as his own</i>.” [Emphasis added.]   </p>

    appellant also relies upon the reasons for judgment of this court in <i>Peet
    v. Babcock
    &amp; Wilcox Industries Ltd.</i> (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 321.  This was a wrongful
    dismissal case in which the court said at para. 8:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>An employee who has been terminated is entitled
    to consider his or her own long-term interests when seeking another way of
    earning a living.  The respondent’s efforts at mitigation cannot be classified
    as unreasonable simply because his actions did not neglect all other interests
    while focussing exclusively on his short-term obligation to mitigate damages
    for the sake of his former employer.</p>

    of the above cases are non-jury cases and do not address the specific issue
    of jury misdirection.  The question in cases of alleged misdirection is not
    whether the charge constitutes a perfect articulation of the law in the relevant
    area.  Instead, as this court noted in

    <i>Pereira</i><i> v. Hamilton Township Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</i> (2006),

style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the context of this charge, the appellant focuses on the last paragraph on
    mitigation, where the trial judge emphasized the appellant’s ability to return
    to work in 2002 and the availability of administrative jobs at that time.  It
    was this single passage from the charge on mitigation to which the appellant’s
    counsel<span style='color:red'> </span>objected at trial.  In my view, this
    passage constitutes a comment by the trial judge regarding the evidence;
    it represents a suggestion by the trial judge that the jury consider two
    aspects of the evidence when examining mitigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s comments were fair given the parties’ relative positions on
    mitigation at trial.  The appellant’s own position at trial was that the
    respondent had failed to prove that there was administrative work available
    to the appellant in 2002.  In other words, by pointing the jury to the evidence
    concerning the availability of administrative work in 2002, the trial judge
    was merely encouraging it to make a finding on an issue on which <i>both
    parties </i>had taken clear and opposing positions.  Bearing in mind that
    a trial judge is permitted to express opinions on the evidence, it is relevant
    to me that the trial judge neutrally pointed to a factual issue central to
    both parties’
    positions on mitigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also,
    before making the impugned evidentiary suggestions, the trial judge clearly
    instructed the jury, in terms favourable to the appellant, that there was
    an important overarching question on mitigation:  whether the defendant had
    proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the plaintiff failed to take
    steps that a reasonable person would take in the circumstances to reduce
    her loss.  The jury was therefore clearly told to consider the reasonableness
    of the appellant’s conduct, which would include her conduct in choosing to
    spend five years pursuing a third university degree – a master’s degree from
    Tyndale College – rather than pursue more immediate employment.  The concept
    of reasonableness was pivotal to mitigation and I am satisfied that the trial
    judge’s charge on this issue was more than adequate.  What I believe becomes
    clear from the jury’s assessment of the damages is that the jury simply did
    not accept as reasonable the appellant’s plan to pursue a third university
    degree over a five-year period.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    making the impugned comments, the trial judge told the jury that it was free
    to consider other aspects of the evidence beyond those raised by the trial
    judge.  In the end, the trial judge simply suggested two aspects of the evidence
    that the jury “may” want to consider on mitigation.</p>

    charge on mitigation and would decline to find the jury award unreasonable

  <h2><i>(b) Was there a Basis to Support the Respondent’s Suggested Figures
      for Future Income and Pension Loss?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    this ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant argues that the jury’s award
    of damages for future income loss was based on a theory postulated by counsel
    for the respondent that Ms. Jones’s future income loss should be calculated
    on the assumption that the difference between what she would earn as a teacher
    and what she would earn if she entered the workforce in an administrative
    position would stay constant each year.  Counsel submits that there was no
    evidence to support this assumption.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    so-called “lock-step” theory was derived from the respondent’s cross-examination
    of the actuarial expert called by counsel for the appellant.  As I read the
    evidence, counsel in cross-examination was testing the opinion of the appellant’s
    expert by putting to him hypothetical questions which counsel is entitled
    to do.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge cautioned the jury as
    to the limited application of the
    “lock-step” theory.  While he could have added that the evidence was based
    upon answers to hypothetical questions, I do not believe his failure to do
    so is any reason to interfere with the jury’s award of damages.  It would
    have been clear from the actual questions that the theory was postulated
    on a hypothetical basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, the quantification of future loss is ultimately an uncertain exercise:  see
    Waddams, <i>The Law of Damages</i>, loose-leaf (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Aurora,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario:  Canada Law Book, 2007) at para. 13.60.  In this case, much of the
    evidence bearing on future loss came from actuarial testimony premised on
    various assumptions and hypothetical questions.  Some assumptions and hypothetical
    scenarios are more likely or plausible than others, but this is a question
    for the jury to decide.  In my view, the jury was adequately instructed on
    the limited use to which it could put the “lock-step” theory and it was entitled
    to assess future loss as it did.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the pension portion of the future income loss, the appellant submits
    that counsel for the respondent advanced another erroneous theory in his
    cross-examination of the actuary.  He asked the actuary to assume that the
    appellant would have obtained pensionable employment from 2002 rather than
    2008 when she was expected to graduate with her master’s degree from
    <st1:place

style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant contends that this assumption required Ms. Jones to have
    completed her counselling degree by 2002.  I disagree.  A fair reading of
    the entire cross-examination on this issue makes it clear that counsel was
    not limiting his questions to the assumption that Ms. Jones would have obtained
    work as a counsellor in 2002.  In one answer given by the witness, it was
    the witness who limited his response to Ms. Jones completing her degree in
    counselling and obtaining a counselling job in 2002.  However, as soon as
    the witness did so, counsel made it clear that the job he was positing was
    not limited to a position as a counsellor.  It included a broader category
    of government jobs.  This is also clear from counsel’s closing address to
    the jury.  In any event, it is clear that the thrust of this cross-examination
    was to establish the simple point that the earlier one starts contributing
    to a pension plan, the greater will be the future entitlement.  In my view,
    counsel for the appellant takes an unreasonably restrictive view of the scope
    of the respondent’s position on the issue of pension entitlement during the
    cross-examination of the actuary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also observe that the argument made by counsel in respect of future loss
    of income is premised on the basis that the jury simply adopted the figures
    advanced by the respondent at trial.  I do not accept this premise.  The
    respondent’s position at trial was that the jury should award a total of
    $240,000 for future loss of income, including loss of pension entitlement.  The
    jury award was nearly $50,000 greater than that number.</p>
  <h2><i>(c) Should the Respondent’s Assumptions and Actuarial Theories have
      Gone to the Jury?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    counsel for the appellant submits that the respondent’s assumptions and actuarial
    theories should not have gone to the jury.  This argument is essentially
    a repetition of the argument in respect of the jury’s award for loss of past
    and future income and, as indicated, I am not persuaded by the appellant’s
    submission.  Counsel further submits that the respondent’s theories were
    confusing to the appellant’s counsel and the trial judge.  He points out
    that this is demonstrated by the fact that the trial judge personally contacted
    the actuary outside of court hours to confirm that the “lock-step” theory
    was plausible.  Appellant’s counsel does not suggest any impropriety on the
    part of the trial judge other than to observe that it was a highly unusual
    step.  That said, there was no objection at trial and no objection in this
    court.  Whatever the trial judge’s confusion may have been, he appears to
    have cleared it up before he charged the jury.  Moreover, as I noted above,
    the respondent was free to introduce assumptions and hypothetical questions
    in the course of leading evidence on future loss of income.  </p>
