  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    appeal from the decision of Low J. granting partial summary judgment dismissing
    a number of aspects of the fired employee’s claim, concerns the legal implications
    when an employer embarks on an investigation of the criminal conduct of its
    employees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    2002, Joao Correia’s employer Canac Kitchens and its parent company Kohler
    Ltd. suspected that there was theft and drug dealing occurring at the Canac
    plant.  They therefore retained a private investigation firm to conduct an
    investigation.  The firm placed an undercover agent in the firm and he identified
    several employees engaged in theft and drug dealing.  The firm kept the local
    police force apprised of the investigation, but the police force did little
    if any independent investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    October 24, 2002 Mr. Correia, a long-time employee aged sixty-two years,
    was brought into his employer’s human resources office, accused of theft
    and fired for cause.  He was then taken to another office and arrested by
    police officers for theft.  The only problem is that Mr. Correia was innocent.  Through
    a series of mistakes, he was confused with another employee with a similar
    name but who was almost forty years younger.  Eventually, the mistake was
    discovered, but by then Mr. Correia claims to have suffered serious injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr.
    Correia and his family sued his employer, the parent company, the private
    investigation firm, the police force and several individuals.  The plaintiffs
    claim damages under various causes of action.  On summary judgment motions
    brought by all the defendants except the police defendants, the motions judge
    dismissed several of those causes of action including claims for negligent
    investigation, malicious prosecution, false arrest, intentional infliction
    of mental distress, inducing breach of contract and intentional interference
    with contractual relations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the following reasons we would allow the appeal in part and in particular,
    set aside the dismissal of the claim for negligent investigation against
    the private investigation firm and for intentional infliction of mental distress
    against Kohler and Marilyn Smith and the Aston defendants. </p>

    company, Kohler.  Canac employs over 800 people at its facility.  By 2002,
    Canac was having a serious problem with theft and drug dealing at its plant.  With
    the assistance of Kohler, Canac decided to attempt to identify the employees
    involved and dismiss them.  Kohler retained Aston to conduct an investigation.  In
    June 2002, Canac added Fashid Dhanji, an employee of Aston, to its payroll
    and he was put on the factory floor.  Because Aston anticipated that Dhanji
    would come in contact with illegal drugs it contacted the York Regional Police
    to obtain advice about handling the drugs.</p>

    which could fall within a category or in a position analogous to an established
    category in which a duty of care has been recognized.  She held that the
    plaintiff was a stranger to Aston and to all of the individual defendants.  While
    he had a contract of employment with Canac, that did not create a duty of
    care contemplated by the claim.  An employer has a right to terminate employment
    and the fact that “in coming to its decision the employer acted on misinformation
    negligently gathered does not augment the employee’s rights; nor is the employer’s
    obligation diminished if it acts without negligence”.  In the absence of
    a duty of care, no action for negligent investigation lies.  </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view, the same reasoning and considerations apply in the case at bar
      as in <i>BMG</i>. Notwithstanding that Aston and Canac represented to the
      police that they would arrange for the right persons to be available for
      arrest as suspects, it is nevertheless not foreseeable that the police
      would undertake no investigation of their own in circumstances where the
      information they were receiving by way of the Aston reports was a compilation
      of second and third hand hearsay. There was neither obligation nor practical
      compulsion to make the arrests on October 24 as opposed to some later date.
      There was no impediment to the police doing its own checking with the actual
      witnesses (the undercover and the videographer) and no impediment to the
      police reviewing the videotape of the theft occurrence before proceeding
      with the arrest.</span></p>

    that to impose tort liability would have a chilling effect on the willingness
    of citizens to report criminal behaviour and she saw no reason to distinguish
    in this regard between “amateur” informants and professionals like Aston.  She
    was also of the view that adequate alternative remedies exist such as an
    action in defamation and, in this case, an action for wrongful dismissal.</p>

    2-3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For the police
    to arrest someone, they are, as a matter of law, required to determine for
    themselves that reasonable and probable grounds exist to do so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In our view
    it cannot be said to be reasonably foreseeable that <i>the police would take
    the information supplied to them by the respondent</i>, <i>however false
    or sloppily prepared, and proceed to charge the appellant without doing the
    job required of them by law</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this court was not laying down as a matter of law that in no case
    where a party provides information to the police can it be said that the
    requisite foreseeability does not exist.  The authorities make it clear that
    reasonable foreseeability depends upon the circumstances and the context;
    the court looks at the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.  As
    McLachlin C.J.C. said in <i>Hill</i>, the first question is “whether it was
    reasonably foreseeable that the actions of the alleged wrongdoer would cause
    harm to the victim”.  In <i>BMG</i>, the alleged wrongdoer had conducted
    an incomplete investigation which was supplemented by information from a
    person in police custody. BMG was not “in the business” of conducting investigations
    and did not have any special expertise in doing so. In those circumstances,
    it was not foreseeable that the police would not conduct a proper investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case, in our view, is different from <i>BMG</i>.  Aston together with Canac
    and Kohler did a complete investigation.  They gathered all of the information
    of the criminal offences and handed a completed case to the police.  To the
    knowledge of Aston, Canac and Kohler, the police were not intending to do
    any further investigation.  To the contrary, the identified employees were
    to be dismissed and then immediately turned over to the police who were on
    the Canac property for arrest.  It would be open to a trier of fact to find
    that to the knowledge of the defendants, the police had limited, if any,
    ability to conduct a further investigation.  Aston had decided not to make
    the undercover employee available at the time of the arrests.  Again, a trier
    of fact could find that Canac, Kohler and Aston had to have known that the
    police would rely completely on their investigation.  It may be that the
    police should have done more; that will be an issue to be determined at trial.  After
    a trial, however, a court could conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable
    in the circumstances existing here that negligence by Aston, Canac and Kohler
    in identifying the real perpetrator of the crime would cause harm to Mr.
    Correia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second element of the first part of the <i>Anns/Kamloops</i> test to establish
    a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care is whether there is a close and direct
    relationship of proximity or neighbourhood.  In <i>Hill</i> at para. 24,
    McLachlin C.J.C. explains that the proximity relationship requires consideration
    of factors such as “expectations, representations, reliance and property
    or other interests involved”.  In <i>Hill</i>, McLachlin C.J.C. was careful
    to point out that a very particular relationship was involved, namely the
    relationship between a police officer and a specific suspect whom the officer
    is investigating.  She was not suggesting that the proximity element is made
    out in respect to every person with whom the police come in contact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in considering the proximity element in this case, it is important to consider
    the nature of the particular relationship.  This case does not involve all
    persons who may provide information to the police or be investigated by the
    authorities.  It involves the duty of care owed by an employer to its employee
    and the duty of care owed by a professional investigator, hired by that employer,
    to a particular employee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hill</i> at
    para. 29, McLachlin C.J.C. stated that the “most basic factor upon which
    the proximity analysis fixes” is whether there is a “close and direct”
    relationship.  She described the nature of this relationship in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>This
      factor is not concerned with how intimate the plaintiff and defendant were
      or with their physical proximity, so much as with whether the <i>actions</i> of
      the alleged wrongdoer have a close or direct effect on the victim, such
      that the wrongdoer ought to have had the victim in mind as a person potentially
      harmed. A sufficiently close and direct connection between the actions
      of the wrongdoer and the victim may exist where there is a personal relationship
      between alleged wrongdoer and victim. However, it may also exist where
      there is no personal relationship between the victim and wrongdoer. [Emphasis
      in original.]</span></p>

    C.J.C. found that the relationship between the plaintiff and the police was
    personal, close and direct.  The police had identified the plaintiff as a
    particularized suspect in a series of robberies and had begun to investigate
    him.  This created a close and direct relationship.  Another consideration
    was the interests engaged.  In <i>Hill</i> at para. 34, McLachlin C.J.C.
    found that even though there were no personal representations and consequent
    reliance, the plaintiff had a critical personal interest in the conduct of
    the investigation:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>At stake are
    his freedom, his reputation and how he may spend a good portion of his life.  These
    high interests support a finding of a proximate relationship giving rise

  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The same
    may be said here: the plaintiff had similar high interests at stake.  </p>

    C.J.C. also took into consideration several other factors in dealing with
    the proximity analysis.  She noted that existing remedies for wrongful prosecution
    such as false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution do not
    provide an adequate remedy for negligent acts.  The same considerations apply
    in this case.  The motions judge dismissed the claim of false arrest against
    the Canac, Kohler and Aston defendants because of the absence of evidence
    of a total deprivation of Mr. Correia’s liberty, and no evidence that the
    police could not exercise their independent discretion.  The claim of malicious
    prosecution was likewise dismissed as there was no basis in the evidence
    for a finding of malice.</p>

    including the availability of <i>Wallace</i> damages (<i>Wallace v. United
    Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701) and punitive damages provide
    adequate remedies.  The appellants produced evidence of the serious consequences
    to Mr. Correia flowing from the dismissal and arrest, including major depressive
    disorder and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, to the point where
    he may never be able to work again.  The appellants argue that damages for
    wrongful dismissal would not fully compensate for injuries, such as loss
    of future income, that the appellants submit flow from the negligent investigation.  We

    v. Pilot Insurance Co.,</i> [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595 at p. 617. Since the purpose
    of punitive damages is not to compensate, there can be no assurance that
    even if awarded they would, together with damages for wrongful dismissal,
    fully compensate the plaintiff for the alleged negligence. We also note that
    punitive damages have been relatively modest in wrongful dismissal cases.

      would agree also with the court's view in <i>Elliot,</i> <i>supra</i>,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      is argued on behalf of the plaintiffs that a duty should be imposed on
      persons like Aston who are in the business of gathering information even
      if no duty is imposed on “amateur” informants – that is, ordinary citizens.
      In this regard, I see no valid reason to draw a distinction between “amateur” informants
      and persons who are in the business of fact gathering. There is a built-in
      inhibition against carelessness on the part of the professional fact gatherer
      in that his livelihood depends on the reliability of the information he
      provides to his client; he stands to lose credibility, clientele, and the
      ability to stay in business should his sloppiness cause his clients loss
      or embarrassment. Professional fact gatherers are not, however, the only
      persons who experience such a built-in deterrent to carelessness – the
      same deterrent applies to a panoply of professional and other persons who
      have a vested interest in maintaining their credibility in the community,

    evidence to support this suggestion; the Aston defendants provided no information
    about their relationship with the police or how it would be affected if a
    duty of care were recognized.  There is a good argument that the potential
    disadvantage from curbing the flow of information between the private security
    firm and the police would be substantially outweighed by the advantage of
    encouraging greater care.  To apply what McLachlin C.J.C. said in <i>Hill </i>at
    para. 56 to this case, it is conceivable that the private firm might become
    more careful in the kinds of information that they pass on to the police

    points out at p. 11 of the same discussion paper, these firms and their clients
    operate largely unregulated; certainly they are not obviously governed by
    the many checks and balances that constrain the public police.  Put simply,
    they can often exercise functionally equivalent powers but without the same
    constraints:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Private security
    officers also have ostensibly considerable authority to deprive individuals
    of their liberty.  Like the public police, private security officers arrest,
    detain and search individuals on a regular basis.  But, for the most part,
    private security officers do not operate under the same constraints as the
    public police … in many facets of their work private security officers are
    not subject to the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>

    pp. 15-16, the discussion paper draws attention to the fact that there is

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    a regulatory system for monitoring the performance of the public police.  The
    problem, however, is that there is little effective oversight of private
    security.”  Finally at p. 19, the paper points out that the public police
    and private investigation firms often cooperate; this “contributes to the
    blurring of the relationship between public and private”.  Again, this case
    is an example.  The investigation was carried out by Aston, but with the

    J.A. found that the first step of the <i>Anns/Kamloops</i> analysis was satisfied;
    that the adjusters and investigators working for the insurer could foresee
    that they would create a risk of harm if they were negligent in their investigation
    and reporting.  Particularly relying upon the decision of the New Zealand
    Court of Appeal in <i>Mortensen v. Laing; South Pacific Manufacturing Co.

    2 N.Z.L.R. 282, Cromwell J.A. was satisfied that there was also sufficient
    proximity.  Accordingly, an investigator retained to investigate the cause
    of loss on behalf of an insurer owed a <i>prima facie </i>duty of care.  However,
    the action against the investigators failed at the second stage because of
    broader policy considerations.</p>

line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    policy considerations led the <i>Elliott</i> court to find against imposing
    a duty of care on the investigators.  They are: (1) the insured had a substantial
    and meaningful remedy in contract against the insurer; and (2) imposing the
    duty would distort the legal relationships among the insured, the insurer
    and the investigators and undermine the ability of the insured and the insurer
    to properly deal with insurance claims.  The respondents in this appeal submit
    that similar policy considerations tell against imposing a duty of care on
    the investigator and the employer for negligence.  We will consider both
    of these policy considerations as explained in <i>Elliott</i> and explain
    why, in our view, they do not apply as against the Aston defendants. As indicated,
    we will deal separately with Canac and Kohler.</p>

line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Elliott</i>,
    Cromwell J.A. noted that in an action on the insurance contract, not only
    can the insured recover for the loss, but breach of the duty of good faith
    can sound in punitive damages as recognized in <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance
    Co., supra</i>.  Thus, while not all heads of damages may be available in
    an action on the insurance contract, the availability of a remedy in contract
    was a significant policy reason not to expand tort liability.  As he put
    it at para. 84, the contractual remedy “is a substantial, if not always complete,
    alternative remedy which strongly works against the expanded liability in
    negligence proposed by the appellants”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents in this case make much the same argument.  They submit that the
    contractual remedy of wrongful dismissal and the potential suit against the
    police for malicious prosecution and negligent investigation are sufficient
    remedies.  We disagree.  In our view, there are important differences between
    the nature and scope of the remedies available in the insurance context as
    compared to the employment context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin with the contractual remedy.  The scope of the remedy for wrongful
    dismissal is described in <i>Wallace</i>.  The fundamental principle that
    underlies that remedy is the right of both the employer and the employee
    to terminate the relationship at will, absent contractual terms to the contrary,
    subject to the requirement of giving notice or in the case of the employer
    salary in lieu of notice.  In <i>Wallace</i>, the court therefore rejected
    the submission that there exists a requirement of good faith reasons for
    dismissal, as well as the possibility that there could be an independent
    action or head of damages for breach of this duty either in contract or in
    tort.  However, the court held, at para. 88, that bad faith conduct in the
    manner of dismissal is a factor that is properly compensated by an extension
    of the notice period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are limits, however, to <i>Wallace </i>damages.  The only compensation to
    which the employee is entitled is for loss of salary and benefits during
    the period of notice that should have been given.  The employee is not compensated
    for the loss of the job, because the employer always had the right to terminate
    the employee.  The employment contract is thus fundamentally different from
    the insurance contract.  The discharged employee may not recover the full
    extent of his or her actual loss. On the contrary, subject to contractual
    terms such as a deductible and bargained-for limit on compensation, the insurer
    is ordinarily required to fully compensate the insured for the actual loss.  In
    our view, therefore, unlike in <i>Elliott</i>, the availability of the contractual
    remedy in the employment context does not tell strongly against expanded
    liability in negligence.  There may be significant additional losses left
    uncompensated in a wrongful dismissal claim, such as loss of the job or non-pecuniary
    damages which, as in a case such as this, may be the direct result of the
    negligent investigation by a private firm that led to the dismissal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the availability of actions for malicious prosecution and negligent investigation
    against the police, there are two answers.  First, the fact that an action
    may lie against one wrongdoer is not generally a basis for relieving another
    wrongdoer from liability.  For one thing, such a state of affairs may be
    unfair to the other alleged tortfeasors.  Second, the court in <i>Hill </i>held
    at para. 35 that the intentional torts such as malicious prosecution “do
    not provide an adequate remedy for negligent acts”.  As in <i>Hill,</i> recognition
    of the tort of negligent private investigation would “complete the arsenal
    of already existing common law and statutory remedies”. As to the availability
    of punitive damages, we have already dealt with that issue in the context
    of proximity and the first branch of the <i>Anns/Kamloops</i> test.</p>

    para. 86.  Cromwell J.A. concluded that far from there being special reasons
    warranting expansion of tort liability on insurance investigators, recognition
    of a duty of care could lead to legal incoherence.  The possibility that
    investigators retained by the insurer could have greater liability to the
    insured for carelessness than the insurer itself, would set up a scheme inconsistent
    with the primacy of the insurer’s obligation to the insured.  Further, such
    a negligence claim could be used as a means of avoiding the determination
    of the real issue of what caused the loss as between the insured and the
    insurer.  In his view, this inconsistency should be avoided.</p>

line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not share the same concerns in the context of the employer, employee,
    and investigator relationships.  While the primary relationship is between
    the employer and employee, we see no reason why different or even greater
    liability cannot be imposed upon the private investigator for its carelessness,
    which allegedly led to the kind of damages claimed in this case, including
    post-traumatic stress disorder.  Further, recovery of damages from a negligent
    private investigator would not serve as a means of avoiding determination
    of the wrongful dismissal claim against the employer, as the kinds of damages
    available under each cause of action do not overlap. </p>

    J.A. also held that permitting liability would interfere with settled principles
    in other areas such as the law of defamation and malicious prosecution.  As
    to the former, according to Cromwell J.A., an investigator reporting to its
    principal would generally benefit from a qualified privilege and thus a defamation
    suit could only succeed upon proof of malice.  Similarly, reports of arson
    not infrequently lead to prosecution but again a suit for malicious prosecution
    could succeed only upon proof of malice.  It seems to us, however, that the
    decision in <i>Hill</i>, which was decided after <i>Elliott</i>, tells against
    this policy consideration.  Again, as pointed out earlier, it was the very
    fact that the plaintiff might be denied compensation because of the inability
    to prove malice that led McLachlin C.J.C. to favour recognition of liability
    for negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cromwell
    J.A. had a second concern with respect to the distortion of legal relationships.  He
    expressed this concern in several ways.  First, he saw “a real possibility
    of conflict between the contractual and the tortious duties which could undermine
    the ability of the insurer to administer insurance contracts in a cost effective
    and expeditious manner”: <i>Elliott </i>at para. 90.  A similar argument
    was made in <i>Hill</i> where the defendants argued that recognizing a duty
    of care to a suspect would interfere with the legitimate exercise of discretion
    by police and lead to confusion with the respect to the legal standard applicable
    to police work.  McLachlin C.J.C. held that those concerns could be answered
    by recognizing a “flexible standard of care appropriate to the circumstances”: <i>Hill</i> at
    para. 55.  She went on to hold that the appropriate standard of care is that
    of a reasonable police officer in like circumstances: <i>Hill</i> at paras.
    67-73.  Such a standard would give due recognition to the discretion inherent
    in police investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Cromwell J.A. in <i>Elliott</i>, at para. 91, was concerned that recognizing
    a duty of care in the insurance context would be unacceptably indeterminate:  “it
    would be difficult to justify not extending the proposed duty of care to
    anyone who, in the course of a contractual engagement, carelessly investigates
    and reports on the conduct of a third party”.  Again, we think the answer
    to this particular concern is now found in <i>Hill</i> at para.&nbsp;60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Recognizing
      sufficient proximity in the relationship between police and suspect to
      ground a duty of care does not open the door to indeterminate liability. <i>Particularized
      suspects represent a limited category of potential claimants.</i> The class
      of potential claimants is further limited by the requirement that the plaintiff
      establish compensable injury caused by a negligent investigation. Treatment
      rightfully imposed by the law does not constitute compensable injury. These
      considerations undermine the spectre of a glut of jailhouse lawsuits for
      negligent police investigation.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    similar reasons, we are of the view that the spectre of indeterminate liability
    is not a consideration in this case.  The universe of potential claimants
    is circumscribed first by the necessity of the employment relationship and
    second by the requirement that the duty is owed by the private investigator
    or firm to particularized suspects who are being investigated for the employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    Cromwell J.A. was concerned about the problem of divided loyalties if the
    investigator were found to owe a duty of care to the insured and a contractual
    duty to the insurer.  Referring to <i>Mortensen</i>, he said at para. 92
    that “imposing a duty of care in relation to the insured might inhibit the
    investigators’ ability to discharge their primary duty to the insurer”.  A
    similar consideration loomed large in <i>Hill</i> and was relied upon by
    the dissenting members of the court for refusing to recognize a duty of care
    for negligence albeit on the basis of lack of proximity: see the reasons
    of Charron J. at paras.&nbsp;140-48. The argument is that imposing a duty
    of care to the individual suspect would interfere with the performance of
    the officer’s public duty: see the example posited by Charron J. at para.
    141.  But McLachlin C.J.C. reached the opposite conclusion at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      personal interest of the suspect in the conduct of the investigation is
      enhanced by a public interest. Recognizing an action for negligent police
      investigation may assist in responding to failures of the justice system,
      such as wrongful convictions or institutional racism. The unfortunate reality
      is that negligent policing has now been recognized as a significant contributing
      factor to wrongful convictions in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    . While the vast majority of police officers perform their duties carefully
    and reasonably, the record shows that wrongful convictions traceable to faulty
    police investigations occur. Even one wrongful conviction is too many, and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    has had more than one. Police conduct that is not malicious, not deliberate,
    but merely fails to comply with standards of reasonableness can be a significant
    cause of wrongful convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar
    concerns apply to private investigations.  As the private sector becomes
    more and more involved in activities that were traditionally within the sphere
    of public policing, the greater the likelihood that their negligence could
    lead to wrongful arrests and even convictions.  We see no incoherence in
    requiring a private investigator to be careful in its investigation; surely
    the client would expect nothing less from the investigator.  In our view,
    to the extent there may be a potential problem of divided loyalties, it is
    not sufficiently important to negate the <i>prima facie </i>duty of care,
    at least outside the insurance context.  This court should not be taken to
    have decided the question of a private investigation firm’s liability in
    the context of an insurance claim, as the matter is not before us in this
    case.</p>

    in <i>Elliott</i> at para. 94, Cromwell J.A. noted that the duty of care
    contended for in that case was not supported by authority and had not been
    recognized in “two roughly analogous situations”.  The two situations were
    claims by parents against professionals who have been retained by opposite
    parties or statutory authorities to assess children for child welfare or
    custody proceedings, and claims against medical assessors retained by insurers
    and employers to report to them concerning another person’s physical or psychiatric

    our view, the policy considerations discussed above favour recognizing a
    duty of care in respect of a private investigation firm retained by an employer
    to investigate criminal wrongdoing.  We emphasize that this conclusion applies
    only to the liability of private investigation firms in this specific context:
    when a relationship is created between a private investigator hired by an
    employer and a specific employee who is being investigated.  The question
    whether there existed such a duty on the facts of the case is a matter that

line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the discussion above, we have reviewed the various policy considerations
    as they apply to the private investigation firm, Aston.  One of the strongest
    considerations favouring recognizing a duty of care for Aston is that it
    is in the business of investigation, performing functions analogous to those
    performed by the police.  However, different considerations apply when considering
    the potential liability of an employer such as Canac, even one that embarks
    upon a criminal investigation of its employee.  We rely on two of the considerations
    referred to by Cromwell J.A. in <i>Elliott</i>.  The first is the possibility
    of legal incoherence; the second is the potential chilling effect on non-professional
    investigators.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fundamental premise of the employer-employee relationship in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is the right, subject to contractual terms to the contrary, of either party
    to terminate the relationship.  Thus, in <i>Wallace</i>, the Supreme Court
    of Canada rejected the submission that an employer must have good faith reasons
    for dismissal or that there could be an independent action or head of damages
    for breach of such alleged duty of good faith, either in contract or in tort.  In
    our view, it would be inconsistent to nevertheless recognize a duty on an
    employer not to conduct a negligent investigation regarding an employee.  To
    do so would be to do indirectly what the Supreme Court expressly rejected
    in <i>Wallace</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court, for policy reasons explained in <i>Wallace</i>, has refused
    to recognize an action in tort for breach of a good faith and fair dealing
    obligation.  In this case, Canac fired the plaintiff for cause.  It concedes
    that it was wrong in doing so and it may have been negligent.  But, in our
    view, to recognize a tort of negligent investigation for an employer would
    be inconsistent with the holding in <i>Wallace</i>.  It would, in effect,
    carve out an exception from the broad holding in <i>Wallace</i> where the
    reason for the dismissal was an allegation of criminality.  We can see no
    principled reason for so doing.</p>

line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason that we would not recognize a duty of care on Canac lies in
    the potential chilling effect on reports of criminality by honest citizens
    to the police.  Unlike Aston, Canac was not in the business of investigation.  It
    was in many ways in the same position as any other citizen who reports criminal
    activity to the police.  Public policy favours encouraging the reporting
    of criminality to the police.  Someone not in the business of private investigation
    who honestly, even if mistakenly, provides information of criminal activity
    should be protected: see <i>Mirra v. Toronto Dominion Bank</i>, [2004] O.J.

    J., as she then was, in the British Columbia Supreme Court decision <i>Rahemtulla
    v. Vanfed Credit Union</i> (1984), 51 B.C.L.R. 200. That case was somewhat
    similar to this one because it involved the abrupt termination of an employee
    based on a wrongful charge of theft. There, a bank teller was accused of
    stealing $2,000 that another teller could not account for and was summarily
    dismissed. She suffered mental distress and sued for wrongful dismissal,
    claiming separately for the damages she suffered for her mental anguish caused
    by the false allegation of theft and the fallout from that false accusation. </p>

    J. first analyzed the mental distress claim as part of the damages for breach
    of the contract of employment. She concluded that the damage did not flow
    from the failure to give adequate notice of dismissal, but from the employee’s
    termination for theft without an opportunity to clear her name, which was
    not a breach of her contract of employment. Although the employee could not
    recover these damages as part of her damages from the wrongful dismissal,
    she could recover in tort. McLachlin J. found, at p.&nbsp;214, that the bank
    manager “acted with a reckless disregard as to whether or not shock would
    ensue from his accusation” and that this was sufficient to make the infliction
    of mental distress willful. She had no trouble concluding, at p. 215, that
    the bank’s conduct was outrageous:
    “Allegations of theft should not be made recklessly, without proper care
    for whether they are true or not.” </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

'>[i]t was clearly foreseeable that the accusations of theft which the defendant

      a claim for breach of contract against a company and a claim for tortious
      conduct against the director with damages assessed on a different basis.
      The exception also assures that officers and directors, in the process
      of carrying on business, are capable of directing that a contract of employment
      be terminated or that a business contract not be performed on the assumed
      basis that the company’s best interest is to pay the damages for failure
      to perform. By carving out the exception for these policy reasons, the
      court has emphasized and left intact the general liability of any individual
      for personal conduct.</p>

    similar analysis must be applied to the Aston defendants as to the Canac
    defendants. The motion judge did not consider their conduct sufficiently
    outrageous to meet the first prong of the test for intentional infliction
    of mental distress. That conduct will now be the subject at trial of an action
    for negligent investigation. If it is found that Aston was negligent in its
    investigation, in the context where it knew the serious consequences of a
    wrongful charge of criminal conduct against an employee, its conduct may
    well be found to be outrageous and to meet the requirement for intentional
    infliction of mental distress. When the motion judge’s reasons for dismissing
    the claims for intentional infliction of mental distress against the Aston
    defendants are viewed in light of this possibility, as well as the motion
    judge’s decision to permit this claim to proceed against Canac, we find that
    her clarifying reasons do not provide a sufficient basis for granting summary
    judgment in favour of Aston or its employees on this cause of action.</p>

    of mental distress. For the reasons that the claim can proceed against Canac

    caused Drouillard to lose his employment, those actions did not amount to “unlawful
    means”, as required for the tort of wrongful interference. However, Cogeco
    was liable for inducing breach of contract, as its actions satisfied four
    criteria: (1) Drouillard had a valid and enforceable employment contract;
    (2) Cogeco was aware of the contract; (3) Cogeco intended to and did procure
    the breach of that contract because Drouillard was terminated without proper
    notice; (4) Drouillard suffered damage as a result: see paras. 26–38.</p>

line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>OBG</i>,
    the House of Lords confirmed that despite some historical confusion of the
    two causes of action, they are distinct in their genesis, purpose, and effect.
    The action for inducing breach of contract began with the decision in <i>Lumley
    v. Gye</i> (1853), 2 E &amp; B 216 (Eng. Q.B.), where a theatre owner convinced
    a noted singer to break her exclusive contract with a rival theatre. Lord
    Hoffman characterized this tort action as based on the concept that someone “who
    procures another to commit a wrong incurs liability as an accessory”: <i>OBG</i> at
    para. 3.  The third party has committed an actionable breach of contract.
    The tortfeasor has acted to procure that breach, and on that basis becomes
    liable as an accessory to the wrongful conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, the intentional interference action traces its history to cases
    such as <i>Garret v. Taylor</i> (1620), Cro. Jac. 567 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Eng.</st1:country-region>
    K.B.)<b> </b>(defendant liable for driving away customers of a quarry by
    threatening them with mayhem and vexatious lawsuits) and <i>Tarleton v. M’Gawley</i> (1794),
    1 Peake NPC 270 (Eng. K.B.) (master of trade ship liable for using cannons
    to drive away a canoe that was approaching a rival trade ship with the intention
    to sell cargo), in which the defendant’s liability was based on the defendant’s
    commission of an <i>independent</i> wrong against a third party. In each
    of these cases, although the actions of the third party in submitting to
    the defendant’s threats provided the immediate cause of the plaintiff’s loss,
    the third party’s actions were in no way wrongful. As such, liability for
    intentional interference is not accessory liability, but rather primary liability “for
    intentionally causing the plaintiff loss by unlawfully interfering with the
    liberty of others”: <i>OBG</i> at para. 6. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over

'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Furthermore, the courts had begun to recognize,
    as part of the inducing breach of contract action, an action for wrongful
    interference with economic relations that was applicable to situations where
    a defendant prevented a third party from fully carrying out its contractual
    obligations with the plaintiff, even though no actual breach of contract
    occurred, and the impugned conduct was not independently unlawful.</p>

    the House of Lords determined to clarify and specifically define the elements
    of each tort. In doing so, the Lords corrected and, where necessary, overruled
    formerly precedential cases that, in hindsight, had introduced confusion
    and error into the definition of the two torts.<a

    and their elements. The Lords were unanimous in all aspects of their definition
    of the two torts except one—Lord Nicholls disagreed on the scope of the concept
    of “unlawful means” in the tort of intentionally causing loss by unlawful
    interference with economic relations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    defining the two torts, the Lords emphasized that both are intentional torts
    that aim to give redress in the context of deliberate commercial wrongdoing:
    see <i>OBG </i>at paras. 141–143, 145, 191 (Nicholls L.). Where the impugned
    conduct is merely negligent, then it must be actionable using negligence
    principles, and if it is not, it cannot be made actionable by recharacterizing
    it as wrongful commercial interference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Lords defined the elements of the tort of inducing breach of contract as
    follows: (1) the defendant had knowledge of the contract between the plaintiff
    and the third party; (2) the defendant’s conduct was intended to cause the
    third party to breach the contract; (3) the defendant’s conduct caused the
    third party to breach the contract; (4) the plaintiff suffered damage as
    a result of the breach (see <i>OBG </i>at paras. 39-44 (Hoffman&nbsp;L.)).
    The Lords confined the tort to cases where the defendant actually knew that
    its conduct would cause the third party to breach (it is not enough that
    the defendant ought reasonably to have known that its conduct would cause
    the third party to breach); the defendant must have intended the breach (it
    is not enough that a breach was merely a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s
    conduct); and there must be an actual breach (it is not enough for the conduct
    to merely hinder full performance of the contract).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    elements of the tort of causing loss by unlawful means are: (1) wrongful
    interference by the defendant with the actions of a third party in which
    the plaintiff has an economic interest; (2) an intention by the defendant
    to cause loss to the plaintiff: see <i>OBG </i>at para. 47 (Hoffman L.).
    Again, the intentionality of the defendant’s conduct is critical: it is not
    enough that the loss was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s conduct;
    to be actionable under this tort, the loss must have been the intended result.
    Furthermore, intentional conduct that causes loss but is not unlawful, is
    not actionable. That is considered permissible competitive commercial behaviour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that the requirement for intentionality may be stricter for these economic
    torts than for the tort of intentional infliction of mental distress, where,
    at least when a person is accused of criminal conduct, the foreseeability
    of the inevitable consequences of reckless conduct can amount to intent.
    The difference of approach is justified in this case. The two economic torts
    are strictly limited in their purpose and effect in the commercial world,
    where much competitive activity is not only legal but is encouraged as part
    of competitive behaviour that benefits the economy. In contrast, intentional
    infliction of mental distress is a personal tort that regulates improper
    activity that causes mental suffering, which is never socially beneficial.
    What degree of intent is required may depend on the nature of the conduct
    that causes the mental distress. As held in <i>Rahemtulla</i>, when a person
    is accused of criminal activity, the potential for mental distress consequences
    is clearly foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of what amounts to “unlawful means” is the one that has caused the
    most difficulty for judges and scholars. The majority of the Lords agreed
    with the following definition found at para. 51 of Lord Hoffman’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Unlawful means
    therefore consists of acts intended to cause loss to the claimant by interfering
    with the freedom of a third party in a way which is unlawful as against that
    third party and which is intended to cause loss to the claimant. It does
    not in my opinion include acts which may be unlawful against a third party
    but which do not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Hoffman summarized his definition of unlawful means as acts against a third
    party that are actionable by that third party, or would have been actionable
    if the third party had suffered a loss. This excludes criminal conduct that
    is not directed at the third party and is not otherwise actionable by that
    party. In contrast, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead views the breadth of conduct
    under the rubric of “unlawful means” as encompassing any conduct that is
    deliberately intended to harm the plaintiff and in breach of a legal or equitable
    obligation under either civil or criminal law. He views the true rationale
    of the tort as providing a remedy for intentional economic harm
    “caused by unacceptable means”, which includes all means that would violate
    an obligation under the law: para. 153. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Nicholls’ approach may be viewed as similar to the one espoused by the decision
    of this court in <i>Reach M.D. Inc. v. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
    of Canada</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 30, which adopted Lord Denning’s characterization
    of unlawful means in <i>Torquay Hotel</i>, <i>supra</i> note 2 at 530, as
    acts which the tortfeasor “is not at liberty to commit”. In <i>Reach M.D</i>.,
    the defendant association made a ruling that was beyond its powers against
    one of its members, which the court found to constitute
    “unlawful means”. However, Rouleau J.A. in <i>Drouillard</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    paras. 19–25, distinguished <i>Reach M.D</i>. and limited its scope, when
    he concluded that Cogeco’s conduct in not following its internal corporate
    policy or acting in bad faith did not amount to unlawful means and that the
    tort of intentional interference with economic relations was therefore not
    made out in that case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the background of this recent judicial consideration of the two torts, we
    turn to the application of the relevant principles to this case. Dealing
    first with the tort of inducing breach of contract, the plaintiffs’ claims
    fail to meet the requirement that the defendants’ conduct was intentional
    in the sense that the defendants intended to procure a breach of contract.
    Neither Kohler nor Aston intended that Canac breach its contract of employment
    with the appellant. To the contrary, their intent was not that that his employment
    would be wrongfully terminated, but that it would be lawfully terminated
    for cause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    similar analysis applies to the tort of intentional interference with economic
    relations. Neither Kohler nor Aston intended to cause harm to the appellant
    by conducting a negligent investigation. Their conduct was not intentional – at
    most it was negligent. To the extent that they were reckless as to the consequences
    of their negligent conduct, recklessness does not amount to an intention
    to cause harm sufficient to make out the tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that it is not necessary to fully define the scope of the “unlawful
    means” component of the tort of intentional interference with economic relations
    to resolve this case. The contention of the appellant is that the negligent
    investigation conducted by Aston and Kohler constituted the unlawful means.
    As discussed above, although Aston may be held responsible in law for such
    negligence, Kohler may not. Therefore, on any definition, Aston’s conduct
    could amount to unlawful means if it was intended to cause harm to the appellant.
    The same conduct by Kohler could not. However, again as discussed above,
    Aston’s alleged negligence is directly actionable by the appellant, based
    on duty of care and foreseeability principles. There is no need to interpose
    the tort of intentional interference to obtain redress against Aston. The
    intentional torts exist to fill a gap where no action could otherwise be
    brought for intentional conduct that caused harm through the instrumentality
    of a third party.</p>
