  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is a sentence appeal.  The appellant contends, first, that the sentences
    should be varied to correct what the Crown concedes was an arithmetic error
    in calculating pre-trial custody, and second, he argues that he should now
    receive credit for time spent in custody on a drug conviction that was quashed
    and the subject of a stay order under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> – events
    that occurred subsequent to the imposition of the sentences that form the
    subject-matter of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court is unanimous that the sentences should be varied, but only to correct
    the arithmetic error.  There is disagreement as to whether the appellant
    should receive “credit” on these sentences for the time spent in custody
    on the drug charge.  I think he should receive “credit”, but my colleagues
    think that he should not.</p>
  <h1><span style='"Times New Roman"'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant received sentences totalling seven years for ten armed robberies
    and two related unlawful confinements.  In fixing the appropriate total sentence
    at seven years, the trial judge, applying the usual two-for-one credit, gave
    the appellant three years credit for 553 days served in pre-sentence custody
    on the robbery charges.  Having regard to the three years credit for pre-sentence
    custody, the appellant received sentences equivalent to ten years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Between
    the appellant’s arrest on the robbery charges and his sentencing on those
    charges, he was convicted on a prior charge of importing cocaine and sentenced
    to two years less a day of imprisonment.  The appellant served 494 days for
    the cocaine conviction.  These 494 days accounted for the entirety of the
    importing cocaine sentence and were in addition to the 553 days of pre-sentence
    custody attributed to the robbery charges.  Before the trial judge, counsel
    agreed that for the purposes of determining the appropriate sentence on the
    robbery charges the part of the appellant’s incarceration attributable to
    the cocaine charge should not be taken into account when fixing the length
    of his pre-sentencing custody.  Counsel also advised the trial judge that
    the appellant’s conviction on the cocaine charge was under appeal at the
    time of his sentencing hearing on the robbery charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequent
    to sentencing on the robbery charges and while this sentence appeal was pending,
    this court quashed the conviction on the importing cocaine charge and ordered
    a new trial:  see <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wilson</i> (2006), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Many months after the new trial was ordered, and while this appeal was
    still pending, the appellant moved successfully in the trial court for a
    stay of proceedings on the basis that his right to a trial within a reasonable
    time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> had been infringed:  see <i>R.
    v. Wilson</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4504 (S.C.J.).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant advances two submissions.  First, he argues that since
    the cocaine conviction was quashed and the proceedings on that charge were
    stayed, the appellant is entitled to full pre-trial custody credit on the
    robbery sentences for the 494 days served on the importing cocaine sentence.  Giving
    the appellant the usual two-for-one credit, counsel submits that his sentences
    on the robbery convictions should be reduced by 988 days (494 x 2).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    counsel submits that trial counsel and, consequently, the trial judge made
    an arithmetic error in calculating the length of pre-sentence custody attributable
    to the robbery charges.  Counsel submits that the appellant was short changed
    by 35 days and should receive credit for a further 70 days pre-trial custody.  The
    Crown agrees with this submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> I
    am convinced by the appellant’s submissions that this court should take into
    consideration the events relating to the cocaine charge that occurred subsequent
    to the sentencing on the robbery charges.  In my view, the court should treat
    this information as akin to fresh evidence on appeal and proceed to determine
    the fitness of the sentence on the robbery charges in light of these post-sentence
    developments.  While I think those developments provide some mitigation,
    I am satisfied that sentences on the robbery charges totalling seven years
    minus seventy days adequately reflect that mitigation.  Consequently, apart
    from correcting the arithmetic error described above, I would not vary the
    sentence imposed at trial.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted after a lengthy trial before a judge alone on ten
    counts of robbery and two related unlawful confinements.  The robberies occurred
    over a one month span in March and April of 2003.  Six of the robberies occurred
    at McDonald’s restaurants and involved the victimization of employees working
    at those restaurants.  Three of the robberies occurred at ATM machines, where
    the appellant robbed four individuals who were at those machines to make
    withdrawals.  All of these robberies are properly described as violent serious
    crimes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    robberies at the McDonald’s restaurants occurred in the early morning hours.  The
    appellant was masked and armed with a large knife and a pistol.  Although
    it looked real, the gun was in fact an air pistol and was not an operable
    firearm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant terrorized the employees at the McDonald’s restaurants in the course
    of the robberies.  At one restaurant, he threatened to shoot an employee
    if he did not immediately open the safe.  He also threatened to stab various
    employees.  At another McDonald’s restaurant, the appellant threatened to
    kill the manager and left two employees handcuffed to a bread rack.  At a
    third McDonald’s restaurant, the appellant struck an employee in the face
    with the pistol causing minor facial injuries.  All of the violence seemed
    calculated to terrorize the victims.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    four robberies of persons at ATM machines occurred in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham area.  As with the McDonald’s restaurants, the appellant was masked
    and armed with a large knife and a realistic looking air pistol.  In the
    course of the last ATM robbery, the appellant accosted two persons who were
    using the ATMs and demanded that each give him $1,000.  While the appellant
    was robbing the two victims, a woman entered the area of the ATMs.  This
    woman saw what was happening and tried to flee the area, but the appellant
    grabbed her.  As the appellant grabbed this individual, one of the victims
    kicked the appellant in the chest and a struggle ensued.  During the struggle,
    the appellant stabbed one of the victims.  Fortunately, that person was not
    seriously hurt.  The struggle with the appellant moved to the parking lot
    where an off-duty policeman happened by.  He assisted in subduing the appellant.  </p>

    air pistol, knife and mask were seized from the appellant at the scene of
    his arrest.  A search of the appellant’s vehicle revealed money that had

    trial judge did not have a great deal of information pertaining to this appellant.  Nor
    does this court.  The appellant was twenty-seven years old at the time of
    sentencing.  He had come to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    about eight years earlier.  He is a landed immigrant and has signed a waiver
    permitting his deportation upon release.  He was described as “an unsophisticated
    person” with cognitive disabilities.  The appellant has limited work skills
    and a limited work record.  He has two children.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant had a single criminal conviction prior to the events giving rise
    to these charges.  Subsequent to the robbery charges, he was charged and
    convicted of assault (August 2003) and possession of cocaine (January 2004).  These
    two convictions were in addition to the cocaine conviction which was later
    quashed by this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submitted that the appellant should receive a sentence of ten to twelve
    years in addition to receiving credit for the equivalent of three years for
    his pre-trial custody.  The defence submitted that the appellant should receive
    five to six years minus the three years credit for the pre-trial custody.  </p>

    careful reasons, the trial judge identified the aggravating factors, stressing,
    quite properly, the vulnerability of the victims selected by the appellant.  He
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Wilson presents
    a clear risk to the safety of the community.  Moreover, the objective of
    general deterrence dictates that it must be made known that there are serious,

    and threatening violence to them in acts of robberies with weapons as seen
    in this case.</p>

    agree with Crown counsel that on a plain reading of s. 719(3) the phrase “convicted
    of an offence” and the phrase “as a result of the offence” must refer to
    the same offence or offences.  Section 719(3) is directed to situations in
    which a person has spent time in custody prior to sentencing in respect of
    the offence or offences for which the person is being sentenced.  It was
    common ground for the trial judge that part of the time the appellant spent
    in custody prior to sentencing was attributable to the robbery charges, but
    that 494 days were attributable to an entirely separate offence, the importing
    cocaine charge.  The subsequent quashing of the cocaine conviction, and the
    still later stay of proceedings in respect of that charge, cannot retroactively
    change the reason for the appellant’s custody during the 494 days between
    February 23, 2004 and July 2, 2005.  He was not in jail at that time as a
    result of the robbery charges; rather, he was serving a sentence on his conviction
    for importing cocaine.  </p>

    giving credit on sentencing for pre-sentence incarceration before the <i>Criminal

    as of the date of sentencing or the hearing of the sentence appeal, those
    other charges had been withdrawn or quashed:  see <i>R. v. Tsai</i> (2005),

    circumstances of the particular offence.  The appropriate sentence must have
    regard to all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors:  see <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, ss. 718.1 and 718.2.  The appellant contends that the quashing
    of the cocaine conviction and the subsequent stay of proceedings alter the
    facts relevant to sentencing and introduce a new mitigating factor.  He argues
    that he stands before this court as a person who was incarcerated for an
    offence for which he was not properly convicted and for which he can now
    never be convicted.  The appellant contends that on any reasonable notion
    of fairness, this court should redress the wrong done to the appellant in
    respect of the importing charge by giving him credit on the robbery sentences
    for the time he improperly spent serving a sentence on the importing charge.  </p>

    facts as they existed at the time of sentencing.  On those facts, counsel
    agree that, apart from the arithmetic error described above, the trial judge
    gave proper credit for the pre-sentence incarceration.  However, events subsequent
    to the sentencing have changed the factual landscape as it relates to the
    appellant’s pre-trial incarceration.  I think it would be just as inappropriate
    for this court to ignore the changed circumstances as it would have been
    for the trial judge to ignore the circumstances at the time of sentencing.  The
    changed circumstances relating to the cocaine charge can be placed before
    this court and considered by it under the authority of s. 687(1) of the <i>Criminal

    this court, having regard to the totality of the circumstances, including

    holding that the appellant can put the subsequent events concerning the cocaine

    do not suggest that the appellant is entitled to an automatic deduction of
    his sentence.  The extent to which his pre-sentencing incarceration for the
    cocaine charge should serve to mitigate the robbery sentences, if at all,
    will depend on the totality of the circumstances.  In some situations, the
    incarceration may have no mitigating effect on the sentence.  In others,
    it may be treated as identical to pre-sentencing incarceration on the charge
    for which the accused is being sentenced.</p>

    counsel argues that the appellant’s incarceration on the cocaine charge should
    not mitigate the robbery sentences because it reflects tactical decisions
    made by the appellant at the time of sentencing.  If I thought that the manner
    in which the pre-sentence incarceration was treated at trial gave the appellant
    some tactical advantage, I would be inclined to agree with Crown counsel
    that the appellant should not be allowed to revisit that tactical decision
    on appeal.  However, I can see no advantage to the appellant in the way his
    pre-sentencing incarceration was treated by the trial judge.  Counsel agreed
    that the treatment of that incarceration by the sentencing judge reflected
    the reality of the situation as it stood at the time of sentencing.  </p>

    would also think that this appellant should receive no mitigating credit
    for his incarceration on the cocaine charge if that incarceration played
    a significant role in securing a stay on his s. 11(b) motion.  While it is
    difficult to think that the appellant’s completion of his sentence did not
    help the appellant in the s. 11(b) motion, counsel for the appellant correctly
    points out that the trial judge who granted the stay made no reference to
    the appellant having served his sentence as a factor in the granting of the

    turning to the question of what sentence the appellant should receive having
    regard to the changed circumstances, I will address one concern raised by
    Crown counsel.  These reasons should not be read as envisioning some kind
    of sentencing bank.  An accused who is incarcerated for an offence for which
    he or she is not ultimately convicted cannot store credits equal to that
    period of incarceration to be used if and when the accused is convicted of
    another crime.  No such system of crediting improper incarceration against
    potential future convictions can or should be recognized.  These reasons
    have a much narrower focus.  They speak to this court’s power to reassess
    the fitness of a sentence where circumstances material to the trial judge’s
    sentencing decision have significantly changed between the time of sentencing
    and the hearing of the appeal.  </p>

    how much credit should he get?  I see no value in entering into the various
    hypothetical calculations advanced in argument.  I would give the appellant
    the credit that was in fact given by the correctional authorities.  On their
    calculations, the 494 days served by the appellant equalled a sentence of
    two years less a day.  </p>

    my calculations, the appellant is entitled to three years plus 70 days credit
    for the 559 days served prior to his sentences and attributable to the robbery
    charges.  He is entitled to an additional credit of two years less a day
    for the 494 days that were attributed at the time of sentence to the cocaine
    sentence.  On this approach, the appellant is entitled to total pre-sentence
    incarceration credit of five years and 69 days.  </p>

    for the appellant submits that the pre-sentence credit that this court determines
    is appropriate should be deducted from the ten years that the trial judge

    accept that sentences equalling ten years are within the range of appropriate
    sentences for these offences and this offender.  Were the circumstances before
    this court the same as they were before the trial judge, I would defer to
    his determination that sentences equalling ten years were appropriate.  However,
    as this appeal has developed, this court is not asked to correct an error
    made by the trial judge (apart from the arithmetic error); instead, it is
    asked to reassess the fitness of the sentences in light of events subsequent
    to the appellant’s sentencing.  For the reasons set out above, I think that
    reassessment is appropriate.  When engaging in a reassessment in light of
    new information, this court does not defer to the sentence imposed at trial.  Rather,
    it must settle on what it regards as a fit sentence bearing in mind all of
    the circumstances, including the changed circumstances.  </p>

    do not propose to repeat the details of the offences.  Like the trial judge,
    I regard deterrence and denunciation as the key principles in the imposition
    of an appropriate sentence in this case.  In my view, the number and seriousness
    of these offences, combined with the absence of any significant mitigating
    factors, requires the imposition of sentences totalling twelve years.  Twelve
    years, the otherwise appropriate sentence, should be reduced to reflect the
    necessary credit for the pre-sentence incarceration.  On my calculation,
    the reduction should be five years and 69 days resulting in a sentence of
    seven years less 69 days.  I would round that sentence off to six years,
    nine months and twenty days.  I would give effect to this variation by varying
    the seven year sentences imposed on counts nine and seventeen to sentences
    of six years, nine months and twenty days.  These sentences and the sentences
    imposed on the other counts run concurrently.  There is, therefore, no need
    to alter the other sentences.  </p>

    time the appellant spent serving his sentence for importing was not in any

    give effect to this submission would permit accused to “bank” time spent
    in custody.  If this appellant can use the time he spent serving his drug
    offence sentence as credit for his robbery sentences, then an accused who
    years earlier spent time in custody for a prior offence of which he was acquitted
    should also be able to ask a trial judge to take that prior time into account.  I
    can see no basis in principle for allowing credit in this case, and not giving
    an accused credit for time spent in custody on a prior offence that was not
    used up because the accused was acquitted of that prior offence at trial.  Or
    consider the case of an accused who successfully appeals his sentence and
    the appeal court reduces the sentence, as it sometimes does, to “time served”.  In
    the future, the appeal court would be asked to indicate what the appropriate
    sentence was so that the difference between the “appropriate sentence” and
    the time served could be banked for any future offence that the accused may
    be found guilty of.  In all of these cases, the offender has spent time in
    jail in excess of what should have been the case if the system had worked
    expeditiously and flawlessly.</p>

    doubt there are flaws in our justice system.  Innocent people are held in
    custody, and innocent people are found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  To
    avoid this severe unfairness, bail is granted as liberally as possible consistent
    with public safety, cases of in-custody accused come on for trial as soon
    as possible and safeguards are in place to avoid wrongful convictions.  As
    well, in some cases, people who have been wrongfully convicted and spent

    at the end of the day when it comes time to sentence an offender the court
    can only take into account factors that relate to the particular offence
    under consideration.  The fact that an offender, like the appellant, still
    happens to be in the appeal system when a flaw in relation to a totally unrelated
    conviction comes to light is not, in my view, a principled reason for giving
    that offender credit for the time he or she spent serving the sentence for

    said, I accept that a sentencing judge is entitled to take into account time
    spent serving another sentence as part of the complete picture for understanding
    a particular offender.  For most offences there is a very broad range of
    what constitutes a fit sentence and events that transpired during the time
    an offender was serving a sentence for another offence might well affect
    where within that range the offender should be sentenced.  For example, if
    the accused had a serious drug problem that made him a danger to the public,
    evidence that he received treatment while serving his sentence would be an
    important consideration in fixing the appropriate sentence.  Or, it may be
    that an offender could not serve a prior sentence in a facility that had
    appropriate treatment, training or other rehabilitation opportunities because
    he was awaiting trial on another charge.  In effect, by reason of the fact
    that he was awaiting trial, the circumstances under which he served the sentence
    were harsher than they might ordinarily be.  I would think these are circumstances
    the sentencing judge could take into account, if made aware of them, because
    they relate directly to the offence for which the offender is being sentenced.</p>

    this case, defence counsel at trial pointed out that during the time the
    appellant was serving his importing sentence, he was moved amongst institutions
    on several occasions and never had the opportunity to take a welding course
    he was hoping to take.  However, defence counsel used this information to
    ask the trial judge to give the appellant two-for-one credit for the time
    spent in pre-sentence custody solely attributable to the robbery offences.  The
    trial judge acceded to this submission.  </p>

    can see one other way in which evidence of a subsequent acquittal might be
    relevant on a sentence appeal.  If the sentencing judge had taken the prior
    conviction into account as a serious aggravating circumstance, the fact that
    the accused was later found to be innocent of that offence would be a relevant
    consideration.  In this case, the trial judge made only passing reference
    to the importing conviction.  There is no indication that he considered this
    record to be a serious aggravating circumstance.  To the contrary, his reasons
    for sentence are focused on the many aggravating circumstances surrounding
    the robbery offences.  It does not appear that the appellant’s conviction
    for importing played any part in the sentence imposed for the robbery offences. </p>

    are two cases in which this court appears to have given credit for time spent
    serving sentence on another offence.  In <i>Tsai</i>, <i>supra</i>, the appellant
    was granted bail on a drug charge.  He was then charged on other matters
    and faced a reverse onus as a result of the outstanding charge.  He was denied
    bail on the new matters.  At sentencing for the drug charge, counsel agreed
    that the time spent on the second set of charges would not be taken into
    account.  The second set of charges was subsequently withdrawn.  On appeal
    from sentence this court gave the accused two-for-one credit for the two
    months spent in custody on the second set of charges.  In doing so the court
    relied upon <i>R. v. Reid</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1790 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The court, at para. 21, described the <i>Reid </i>case in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      appellant submits that the time he spent in jail should now be credited
      towards this sentence. In support of his submission, the appellant relies
      on <i>R. v. Reid</i>. In that case, the accused was in custody on a second
      set of charges and served six months before the charges were subsequently
      withdrawn. At the time the appellant was refused bail on the second set
      of charges, the Crown had brought an application under s. 524 to revoke
      the accused's bail on the first set of charges but the trial judge never
      dealt with that application. This court held that after being found guilty
      on the first set of charges, the trial judge should have taken the withdrawal
      of the second set of charges and the time served in relation thereto into
      account on sentencing and given the accused credit for pre-trial custody
      on the first set of charges.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    both <i>Reid</i> and <i>Tsai</i> appear to be examples of this court permitting
    the banking of pre-sentence custody, it seems to me that there is another
    explanation.  In both cases the accused was refused bail on the second set
    of charges (the charges that were later withdrawn) because he was already
    on bail for the first set of charges.  Thus, in part, the time spent in custody
    for the withdrawn set of charges could be attributed to the first set of
    offences.  In any event, neither <i>Reid</i> nor <i>Tsai</i> represent the
    stark picture presented in this case where an appellant seeks to have this
    court retroactively take into account time spent serving sentence on another
    offence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    while I would grant leave to appeal sentence, I would allow the appeal from
    sentence only to the extent of reducing the sentence by 70 days that was
    properly attributable to detention for the robbery offences but was mistakenly
    not taken into account by the trial judge.  Thus, I would reduce the total
    sentences imposed to six years, nine months and twenty days.  I would not
    give the appellant any credit for the time spent serving the sentence for
    the charge of importing cocaine.</p>
