  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appeal court judge misapplied the legal test for appellate
    review and in so doing in effect, retried the case.  The only issue at trial
    was the respondent’s <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i>.  The trial judge gave thorough
    reasons for finding that the respondent intended to provide a breath sample
    unsuitable for adequate analysis by a screening device.  There is no basis
    to interfere with her finding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court judge said and the respondent submits that the trial judge erred
    by failing to appreciate two pieces of evidence: the evidence on lack of
    motive and the alleged consciousness of innocence evidence.  In our view,
    the trial judge did not err as alleged by the appeal court judge and the
    respondent.  We make the obvious observation that a trial judge is not required
    to refer to every piece of evidence led at trial.  That is especially so
    where, as here, the trial judge in our busy provincial courts gives oral
    reasons after a short and simple trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of motive, the appeal court judge found that the trial judge did
    not adequately deal with the evidence of Ms. Stinson or the amount of alcohol
    the respondent had consumed.  However, the trial judge dealt both with Ms.
    Stinson’s evidence as part of the defence evidence, and with the amount of
    alcohol consumed.  The trial judge was entitled to give this evidence little
    weight.  Ms. Stinson’s evidence was of marginal relevance, at best, to the
    issue of the respondent’s intent.  And, as the trial judge pointed out, no
    inference could be drawn from the amount of alcohol the respondent said she
    had consumed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court judge also said that the trial judge erred by failing to address
    the alleged consciousness of innocence evidence.  However, the trial judge
    did take account of one aspect of the respondent’s after-the-fact conduct
    on the only live issue raised at trial, the respondent’s intent.  The appeal
    court judge’s concern and the respondent’s real complaint is that the trial
    judge did not give this after-the-fact conduct evidence greater exculpatory
    weight.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, other than showing that the respondent had no medical or physical
    condition that prevented her from giving a breath sample (which was adverted
    to by the trial judge), the respondent’s after-the-fact conduct had little
    relevance to the issue of her intent.  Accordingly, the trial judge did not
    err by not dealing with this evidence in greater detail in her reasons.  Indeed,
    by not addressing it more fully, the trial judge implicitly rejected the
    respondent’s submission that this evidence showed consciousness of innocence.  Moreover,
    we add that the characterization of the respondent’s after-the-fact conduct
    as consciousness of innocence evidence was never put to the trial judge in
    the way it was put to the appeal court judge and to this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed, the decision
    of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside, and the conviction
    is restored.</p>
