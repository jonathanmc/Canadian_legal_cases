      appellant pleaded guilty to assault with a weapon and use of an imitation
      firearm to commit an indictable offence.  The sentencing judge rejected
      a joint submission presented by counsel and sentenced the appellant, a
      young offender, to 116 days in custody followed by 58 days of supervision
      and 18 months probation.  Her reasons state that she also designated the
      offence as a “serious violent offence” although the information does not
      appear to have been endorsed to that effect.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issue in this appeal is the correct interpretation of ss. 42(5) and
    42(9) of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002 c.1 (the <i>YCJA</i>).  Specifically,
    the issue is whether, absent an application by the Attorney General under
    s. 42(9), the sentencing judge’s finding that the offence is a “serious violent
    offence”
    precludes the imposition of a deferred custody and supervision order under
    s. 42(5).  For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the sentencing
    judge erred in principle in concluding that she was precluded.  I would therefore
    allow the sentence appeal.  </p>

      facts admitted by the appellant were that on April 28, 2006, at about 6:00
      p.m., the complainant and some friends were playing in a park when the
      appellant and two others came up to them.  The appellant had a bandana
      covering his face at the time.  The complainant was accosted by the appellant
      and a co-accused.  The appellant pointed a pellet gun to the back and neck
      of the complainant.  The pellet gun did not have any pellets inside it.  Eventually,
      the appellant and his friends left the complainant alone.</span></p>

      joint submission suggested by Crown counsel and defence counsel was for
      two years probation subject to a number of terms including 60 hours of
      community service, counseling, a no contact order with the complainant
      and a letter of apology.</span></p>

      hearing the proposed sentence, the sentencing judge expressed concerns
      about its appropriateness.  She adjourned sentencing to allow for the preparation
      of a pre-sentence report and for counsel to provide her with case law setting
      out the appropriate sentencing range.  She commented that “[i]f it is in
      the range and you can persuade me, you know, fine, but it just, it offends
      what I think the range is.”  One of the sentencing judge’s concerns was
      that the offence involved the use of an imitation firearm in a jurisdiction
      where firearms are a significant problem.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    parties returned before the sentencing judge approximately three months later.  A
    victim impact statement and a pre-sentence report were filed and evidence
    was called.  The sentencing judge expressed continuing concerns with respect
    to the joint submission.  She was concerned that a community disposition
    would not adequately address the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration
    needs.  She was also concerned over whether the appellant would or could
    comply with the proposed terms of probation.  To address these concerns,
    the parties modified the original proposed terms of probation and both agreed
    that, should the judge find that a custodial disposition was appropriate,
    a deferred custody and supervision order should be imposed pursuant to s.
    42(2)(p) of the <i>YCJA</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    sentencing judge, in thoughtful and thorough reasons, explained why she rejected
    the original joint submission.  Particular emphasis was placed on the pre-sentence
    report, which revealed concerns about the appellant’s ability to comply with
    a community disposition.  She also noted that the case law put before her
    failed to establish a range of sentencing for these particular offences.  </p>

    sentencing judge then addressed the proposal for a deferred custody and supervision
    order.  She began by reviewing the application of s. 42(5), which provides
    in part as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The court may make a deferred custody and supervision order
    under paragraph (2)(<i>p</i>) if</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) the young

    sentencing judge found that the appellant’s conduct, in putting an imitation
    firearm to the head of an individual, constituted a
    “serious violent offence” and concluded that s. 42(5)(a) prevented her from
    making a deferred custody and supervision order.  Ultimately, she found that
    the proposed joint submission would be contrary to the public interest and
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, bearing in mind
    the principles of sentencing set out in the <i>YCJA</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge subsequently imposed the sentence now under appeal.  In
    so doing, she designated the offence as a “serious violent offence” under
    s. 42(9) of the <i>YCJA</i>, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On application
    of the Attorney General after a young person is found guilty of an offence,

    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough, the community in which the offence occurred.  The appellant
    argues that this concern for deterrence and denunciation dominated the reasoning
    for the sentence imposed and, as a result, the sentencing judge gave inadequate
    weight to the other sentencing principles in the <i>YCJA</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  Although the sentencing
    judge did express concerns about the gravity of the offence, these were not
    the only factors considered.  In her reasons, she also considered the need
    to rehabilitate and integrate this offender into the community.  She specifically
    considered the types of alternative programs that would be available to address
    the appellant’s needs in the community and considered the likelihood that
    he would comply with the conditions of a community disposition as required
    by s. 39(3) of the <i>YCJA</i>.  Her reasons reflect no error in this regard.</p>

      sentencing judge did not err in rejecting the original joint submission.  When
      that joint submission was presented, the sentencing judge informed counsel
      that she was disinclined to accept the proposal and she afforded the parties
      an opportunity to make submissions on the matter.  The sentencing judge
      acknowledged the high threshold for rejecting a joint submission and adjourned
      the sentencing hearing to obtain further information and allow counsel
      time to address her concerns.  In her reasons, the sentencing judge fully
      explained and justified her rejection of the original joint submission.  In
      those reasons, it was apparent that she had fully considered the circumstances

    reference in the sentencing judge’s reasons to the different timing of the
    pleas was made in the context of explaining, in part, why she did not think
    the principle of parity was as significant as had been argued by counsel.  The
    timing of a guilty plea affects its impact in mitigation.  See <i>R. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Rosenberg</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 3260 (Gen. Div.).  The sentencing judge’s
    reference to timing as a distinguishing feature between the co-accused was
    therefore entirely appropriate here.  She did not, in my view, treat the
    appellant’s late guilty plea as an aggravating factor; rather, she properly

    s. 42(2)(<i>p</i>) provides for the deferred custody and supervision order,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      in its immediate context and in the context of the Act as a whole.  When

      impressions based on immediate context must be supplemented by considering

        called upon to address the meaning of “violent offence” as that expression
        is used in the <i>YCJA</i>.  In doing so, the court considered both the
        object and scheme of the <i>Act</i> as well as how the provisions in
        the <i>Act</i> should be interpreted.  At para. 50 of the reasons, Bastarache

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[I]t is my conclusion that the object and scheme of the <i>YCJA</i>,<i> </i>as
      well as Parliament’s intention in enacting it, all indicate that the <i>YCJA</i> was
      designed, in part, to reduce over-reliance on custodial sentences for young
      offenders, and, therefore, a narrow interpretation of the term “violent
      offence”, which acts as a gateway to custody, is to be preferred.  This
      conclusion also squares with the well-known principle of statutory interpretation
      that states that “where two interpretations of a provision which affects
      the liberty of a subject are available, one of which is more favourable
      to an accused, then the court should adopt this favourable interpretation”:
      See <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para. 29.  Clearly,
      a narrow interpretation of “violent offence” is more favourable to an accused,
      since such an interpretation will limit the circumstances in which custody
      will be a sentencing option.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…Although s. 42(5) could perhaps have been worded more clearly,
    it is nonetheless apparent that a determination as to whether an offence
    is a serious violent offence for purposes of s. 42(5) is not something which
    can be made independently of the procedure contemplated by s. 42(9).  The
    most obvious and straightforward reading of s. 42 as a whole is that, before
    an offence can be treated as a serious violent offence for purposes of s.
    42(5), it must have been determined to be such an offence pursuant to s.
    42(9).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Saskatchewan Court of Appeal explained that s. 42(9) has procedural safeguards
      that must be complied with before a designation of serious violent offence
      can be made and the <i>YCJA</i> specifically provides for the possibility
      of appealing such a designation.  Similar procedural safeguards are not
      provided for under s. 42(5).<b>  </b>If the use of the term “serious violent
      offence” in s. 42(5) is not tied to the designation contemplated in s.
      42(9), a serious violent offence finding for the purposes of s. 42(5) could
      be made without the procedural safeguards set out in s. 42(9).  While acknowledging
      that procedural requirements respecting the determination of serious violent
      offence could possibly be implied under s. 42(5) pursuant to the <i>Charter</i> or
      the common law, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal observed at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      offence status under the latter subsection.  In other words, the fact that
      s. 42(5) makes no reference to an application by the Attorney General or
      to an opportunity for both sides to be heard is a clear indication that
      a serious violent offence determination is to be made only pursuant to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In cases where
    the Crown exercises its jurisdiction not to proceed to obtain a judicial

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>The sentencing judge in that case also commented at para. 42 that, if Parliament
    intended to remove the deferred custody and supervision option only where
    a serious violent offence determination under s. 42(9) had been made, it
    would have made this clear in the subsection.</p>

    quite agree that the seriousness and violence of an offence are not dependent
    on there having been a successful application by the Attorney General pursuant
    to s. 42(9).  Even where no s. 42(9) application is brought by the Attorney
    General, a sentencing judge may well conclude that the seriousness and violence
    of the offence are such that a deferred custody and supervision order is
    not appropriate.  This, however, is quite different from removing the option
    altogether.  A sentencing judge, after having considered all of the relevant
    circumstances including the fact that it was a serious and violent offence
    may well conclude that a deferred custody and supervision order is appropriate
    and would best meet the objectives of the <i>YCJA</i>.  The loss of the option
    is significant for the young offender, as it functions to restrict the sentencing
    options available and is more likely to result in a custodial sentence.  In
    my view, the procedural safeguards of s. 42(9) have to be respected before
    s. 42(5) operates so as to preclude a sentencing judge from imposing a sentence
    the judge would otherwise consider appropriate.</p>

    conclusion, before the statutory consequences of a finding that an offence
    is serious and violent will flow into the various subsections of s. 42, an
    application by the Attorney General pursuant to s. 42(9) is necessary.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"

    “serious violent offence” as a reference to an offence for which a s. 42(9)
    application has been brought and a judicial determination has been made that
    the offence is a “serious violent offence” in accordance with s. 2(1) of
    the <i>YCJA</i>.  Absent a s. 42(9) determination, a deferred custody and
    supervision order can be made by a sentencing judge whether or not the offence
    is viewed by the sentencing judge as meeting the definition of “serious violent
    offence” in the <i>YCJA</i>.  The sentencing judge will, of course, take
    the seriousness and the violence of the offence into account when fashioning
    the appropriate sentence and, specifically, in deciding whether or not to
    make a deferred custody and supervision order.</p>

    my view, therefore, the sentencing judge erred in concluding that, because

    to prevent her from making a deferred custody and supervision order.  Although
    it is not clear whether the sentencing judge would have sentenced the appellant

  <p>(ii) in the young person’s normal occupation, including employment, vocational
    or educational training and volunteer work,</p>

    designed to “send a clearer message to those involved in the youth criminal
    justice system about restricting the use of custody for young offenders”: <i>R.
    v. C.D.; R. v. C.D.K.</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 668 at para. 48.  As noted by
    the then Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Anne McLellan, “The
    proposed youth criminal justice act is intended to reduce the unacceptably
    high level of youth incarceration that has occurred under the Young Offenders
    Act.”: House of Commons Debates, February 14, 2001, at p. 704.</p>

    “procedural code” established under s. 42(9) for “serious violent offence”
    designations was described more recently by this court in <i>R. v. V.W.</i> (2008),
    232 O.A.C. 332, in which Sharpe J.A. noted at para. 24 that the procedural
    requirements established under s. 42(9) “make it clear that [a serious violent
    offence] designation is a discrete process that entails a judicial determination
    based on the evidence following a hearing at which the offender must be accorded
    procedural fairness.”</p>

      v. H.A.M.</i>, [2003] 9 W.W.R. 533 (
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Man. Prov. Ct.).  In that case, the trial judge decided that, since the Crown
    had not made a formal application under s. 42(9) to have the offence designated
    a “serious violent offence”, the court was not precluded from imposing a
    deferred custody and supervision order, even though it was apparent that
    the offence before the court would easily qualify under the amorphous definition
    of “serious violent offence” in s. 2 of the <i>YCJA</i>.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[6]</span></span></span></a> This
    interpretation would extend as well to s. 42(7), which provides the youth
    court justice with the authority to make an intensive rehabilitative custody
    and supervision order in respect of a young person only if certain conditions
    are met, such as that the “young person has been found guilty of a serious
    violent offence”.</p>
