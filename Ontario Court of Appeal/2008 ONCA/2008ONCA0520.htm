  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown appeals an order in which Justice Arthur Gans of the Superior Court
    of Justice stayed the proceedings pursuant to s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The respondent, Christopher MacMunn, was charged
    with possession of child pornography, accessing child pornography and making
    child pornography by copying material from the internet onto computer disks.  There
    was a 27 ½ month delay between the time of arrest and the commencement of
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was arrested on April 1, 2005 and after thirteen appearances in
    the Ontario Court of Justice, a two day preliminary hearing was set on February
    23, 2006 to commence on January 8, 2007.  The preliminary hearing concluded
    with a committal for trial on February 12, 2007.  The case was fixed for
    a trial to commence in the Superior Court on July 23, 2007.  At the opening
    of trial, counsel for the respondent made his application to stay the proceedings
    which was granted by Justice Gans on the basis of unreasonable delay attributed
    to the slow pace of Crown disclosure and institutional delay in respect of
    the commencement of the preliminary hearing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown submits that the trial judge committed two errors of law in
    granting the stay:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    failed to assess properly the inherent time require-ments of the case; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    failed to balance the prejudice suffered by the respondent from the delay
    with the societal interest in having a trial of the charges on the merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons which follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    charges against the respondent arose out of an American investigation (code
    named “Project Falcon”) into Internet child pornography.  Project Falcon
    identified sixty-seven potential suspects who lived in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The respondent was one of the suspects.  A search warrant was executed
    on the respondent’s residence on April 1, 2005 and he was arrested the same
    day.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was released on bail on April 4, 2005 subject to a number of conditions.  On
    that court appearance, the case was adjourned to April 28, 2005 in order
    for the Crown to provide disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the initial appearance on April 4, 2005, there were twelve further attendances
    in the Ontario Court of Justice prior to the court fixing a preliminary hearing
    date in February 2006 for January 2007.  A dominant feature of virtually
    all but two or three of the twelve attendances in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court was defence counsel’s pursuit of disclosure of the Crown case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    this period, counsel for the defence forwarded several letters to the Crown
    raising disclosure requests.  As of February 20, 2006, there were still outstanding
    materials relating to the information to obtain the search warrant against
    the respondent and information from the American investigation.  Also outstanding
    at that time were requests for material seized from the Toronto Dominion
    Bank in March 2004 related to the respondent and the notes of the police
    officer who was involved in the seizure of materials from the Toronto Dominion
    Bank.  It is worth noting here that the notes of that police officer were
    not produced until December of 2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    emerges from a review of the transcripts of the many court attendances and
    the correspondence between counsel for the defence and the Crown is that
    the disclosure requests of the defence counsel were not being attended to
    within a reasonably expected time frame.  It is acknowledged by counsel for
    the appellant that this case was not a model of case management.  The situation
    was further exacerbated by the fact that the assigned Crown was out of the
    country on holiday from some time in November 2005 to the end of January
    2006.  There is no doubt that the Crown assigned to the case in this interim
    period was engaged in a game of “catch up” in respect of the disclosure issues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, the preliminary hearing was fixed on February 23, 2006 for
    two days in January 2007.  On February 23, 2006, the presiding judge expressed
    his concern about the length of time that would elapse before a preliminary
    hearing could take place.  As a result, the judge personally spoke with the
    trial co-ordinator and confirmed that the earliest available dates were in
    January 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was committed for trial on February 12, 2007.  The case then moved
    ahead with relative dispatch to a trial date on July 23, 2007 when the s.
    11(b) application was heard.</p>
  <h2>The Section 11(b) <i>Charter</i> Application</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his ruling, the trial judge addressed the evidence concerning disclosure
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There appeared to be false steps, if not stutter
    steps, in the way the material was being collected and delivered to the accused
    through his counsel, which, in my view, could have been avoided had someone
    taken the leadership in determining that all aspects of the investigation
    resulting in the applicant’s arrest, met the Crown’s disclosure obligation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, the issue is aptly underscored by two
    examples:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    problems attendant to the obtainment of unsealing orders pursuant to s. 487.3
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in respect of the two search warrants that the
    police had obtained as part of the investigation; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that the officers notes were not delivered at the same time as the Inform-ations
    to Obtain were disclosed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In other words, the Crown or the officer in charge
    knew or ought to have known from the outset the manner in which the investigation
    led to the arrest of the accused and knew as a consequence thereof that two
    search warrants had been obtained in respect of this accused and that disclosure
    of notes and material in respect of same would be integral to the defence
    of the case.  That having been said, all information necessary to obtain
    a vacating order should have been communicated to the accused within the
    intake period so that he could have moved with greater dispatch to obtain
    the requisite vacating orders had he chosen to do so before the end of summer
    of 2005.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I would note that [the Crown] acknowledged that
    all this information would have been readily and routinely apparent in the
    officers’ notes, which notes particularly those of the officers involved
    in the obtainment of the search warrants at first instance, only came to
    light after numerous letters, numerous attendances at court, and in dribs
    and drabs over months.  In my view, this form of disclosure, while not necessarily
    arising from some form of <i>mala fides</i>, occurred, minimally, as a result
    of poor case management, for which the Crown, generically, must assume responsibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the balance of the time from the fall of 2005 to the
    commencement of the preliminary hearing in January 2007.  He observed that
    the disclosure requests that were outstanding in February 2006 remained outstanding
    until November 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown submitted to the application judge that the case at bar was
    a complex case which at least in part explained the delay in disclosure.  The
    trial judge rejected this submission.  In his opinion, the case was not a “one
    off”.  It was one of many such cases and what was needed for disclosure was
    not unique to this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was the trial judge’s view that the parties should have been ready to set
    a date for the preliminary hearing in the early fall of 2005:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In other words, had the parties been ready to set
    a date for the preliminary [hearing] in the early fall of 2005, as they should
    have been, all things considered equal, I am not able to determine by hindsight
    whether or not the preliminary would have been 10 to 11 months out from that
    date or earlier, as seems to have been suggested by Justice Bovard when he
    was reviewing the matter at the end of February 2006.  It may well have been
    that the <i>Morin</i> guidelines could have been more readily and easily
    reached had the disclosure or other such matters, for which I hold the Crown
    responsible, not been resolved more readily and expeditiously.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, the Crowns associated with this type
    of prosecution, serious as it undoubtedly is, should have been able to respond
    in a more timely fashion, particularly since Mr. Clark, who did not strike
    me as one who postured unnecessarily, was writing countless demand letters,
    a trait not routine for the defence bar, in general.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On balance, I am of the view that the time below
    was not just a ‘tad long’, but was excessive and in the final analysis unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    arriving at his conclusion, the trial judge considered the issue of prejudice
    to the respondent.  He began by observing that prejudice can be inferred
    from the mere fact of the overall delay.  However, in this case, there was
    evidence of actual prejudice in an affidavit filed by the respondent and
    unchallenged by cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his affidavit, the respondent deposed that the delay has had an effect on
    his health.  He was prescribed anti-depressant medication shortly after his
    arrest and, at the time of the application, the respondent was taking a very
    high dosage that his doctor described as the maximum dosage.  The respondent
    testified that he was sick to his stomach most mornings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    numerous attendances at court for remands related to disclosure have proved
    expensive in terms of the payment of legal fees.  The respondent’s legal
    fees have exceeded the original estimate for the entire case by more than
    $10,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    restrictions placed on the respondent’s travel do not permit him to travel
    to the head office of his employer in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Virginia.  His employer had requested that he travel to
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Virginia at least eight different times but he has had to decline the request
    and he said that he is running out of excuses.  He testified that he is at
    risk of losing his job.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent described himself as a person who, prior to these charges, led
    an active outdoor life.  He was prohibited from entering parks where persons
    under 18 may be found.  He could not take a bicycle ride with his girlfriend
    through a park because of this prohibition.  Similarly, he has been unable
    to participate in baseball which was a significant part of his recreational
    activities prior to his arrest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    of his inability to travel outside
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , except for employment reasons, he could not visit his brother’s family
    in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Nunavut.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the issue of prejudice, the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, there is some evidence, and I underscore
    the word “some”, of prejudice which has affected Mr. MacMunn beyond the mere
    charges and which is not restricted to the charges.  In the final analysis,
    I am satisfied that the delay has affected his relationship with his employer,
    his family, and latterly his girlfriend.  Indeed, there is some evidence
    that he is obliged to take prescription medicine to combat the mild depression
    from which he presently suffers, which state I concede might arguably arise,
    as well, from the charges themselves.  I hasten to observe that the prejudice

    the much cited case of <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)
    at 13, Sopinka J. listed the relevant factors for a court to consider in
    assessing whether there has been unreasonable delay:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Sopinka J. emphasized that the approach
    to a determination of whether there has been unreasonable delay is “not by
    the application of a mathematical or administrative formula but rather by
    a judicial determination balancing the interests which the section is designed
    to protect against factors which either inevitably lead to delay or are otherwise
    the cause of delay.”  See Morin at page 13.</p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 467, aff’d [1992] 2 S.C.R. 168, Arbour J.A. stressed the importance
    of taking into account the total period of delay:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is easy to lose sight of the importance of the
    total period of delay, particularly when engaged in an examination of the
    causes for various components of the total delay.  A case may take too long
    to reach the preliminary inquiry, but then may be tried very expeditiously
    after committal, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Ultimately, it is the reasonableness
    of the total period of time that has to be assessed, in the light of the
    reasons that explain its constituent parts.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown acknowledges that the 27 ½ month delay warrants inquiry.  The Crown
    does not allege that there was constitutional waiver of any of the time periods
    by the respondent.</p>
  <h2><i>Did the trial judge fail to assess properly the inherent time requirements
      of the case?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the reasons for delay, Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i> described the
    inherent time requirements as the time required to prepare a case for trial.  One
    of the requirements to consider is the complexity of the case.  The more
    complicated the case, the longer will be the time for preparation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the complexity of the case, Sopinka J. identified the “intake
    requirements” as common to most cases.  The intake requirements include such
    matters as retaining counsel, bail hearings, police and administration paperwork
    and Crown disclosure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of inherent delay in this case, counsel for the Crown submits:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Nowhere in the trial judge’s reasons does he refer
    to, let alone consider, the inherent time requirements of this particular
    case.  Save for rejecting the Crown’s characterization of this case as complex,
    at no point in his reasons does Gans J. consider the factors unique to this
    case and their import in the s. 11(b) analysis.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown argues that this case was complex because, among other things,
    two Informations to Obtain had to be unsealed.  He further submits that the
    respondent’s arrest arose from a large scale international investigation
    which gave rise to a dispute over what material should be produced from that
    investigation.  The Crown referred to other evidence which he said supported
    his argument that this was a complex case.  However, the trial judge concluded
    differently.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree with the Crown’s position in respect of the complexity issue.  The
    trial judge in this case is a very experienced judge.  It would be surprising
    if this court did not defer to his view of what is and what is not a complex
    case.  His reasons indicate that he paid particular attention to the issue
    of complexity.  His conclusion is amply supported by the evidence.  The Crown’s
    submission is an invitation to retry this issue.  In my view, the finding
    in respect of the complexity issue is a finding of fact and I see no basis
    upon which we would interfere with that finding.</p>

    addition to the issue of complexity and as part of the argument concerning
    the inherent time requirements related to disclosure, counsel for the Crown
    makes the following submissions in respect of the conduct of counsel on both
    sides of the case:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>None
    of the disclosure issues resulted in either the preliminary hearing or the
    trial being adjourned once the dates were set and that the state of disclosure
    did not delay the setting of the dates.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no allegation that the Crown’s position in respect of the unsealed materials
    was not taken in good faith.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 15, 2005, the proceedings were adjourn-ed for seven weeks at the
    request of defence counsel so that he could gather materials for discussion
    with the Crown presumably for resolution purposes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 15, 2005, the defence sought a four week adjournment to January
    12, 2006 which was not related to the timeliness of disclosure.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    trial date of June 11, 2007 was offered but declined by counsel for the respondent
    in favour of the July date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree that none of the disclosure issues was responsible for the delay.  It
    is clear that once the preliminary hearing date and trial dates were eventually
    fixed, there were no adjournments of those dates.  However, what is abundantly
    clear is that during the period between the respondent’s arrest on April
    1, 2005 and the fixing of the preliminary hearing date in February 2006 for
    January 2007, there was a period of considerable delay.  The trial judge
    found that the length of the delay was unreasonable and that it was caused
    by the slow pace of disclosure.  There was much evidence to support his conclusion.  The
    trial judge also concluded that this was a case in which disclosure should
    have been completed by early fall 2005.  Common sense suggests that if it
    had been completed by early fall, the case would have proceeded to trial
    much more quickly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree that there is no allegation that the Crown’s position with respect
    to the unsealed documents was not taken in good faith.  The trial judge also
    appears to have agreed that this is so.  However, this does not change the
    analysis that the delay was unreasonable.  This is not a fault finding exercise. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the seven week adjournment on September 15, 2005, counsel for
    the Crown observes that the trial judge properly considered this a neutral
    request.  However it is characterized, it had no effect on the pace of disclosure
    which is what was the root cause of the delay.  Counsel for the defence did
    not become aware of the second search warrant until November 1, 2005.  The
    defence brought an unsealing application two days later on November 3, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    the adjournment from December 15, 2005 to January 12, 2006 appears to have
    been irrelevant to the pace of disclosure.  Disclosure was still dragging.  As
    noted above, the Crown does not allege constitutional waiver on the part
    of the respondent in respect of either the September 15 or December 15 adjournments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that defence counsel preferred a trial date in July rather than in mid-June
    is of no moment.  By that time, the proceedings had already exceeded the
    guidelines in <i>Morin</i> (8-10 months) for the proceeding in the court
    below by a number of months –
    particularly when the institutional delay in respect of the lengthy adjournment
    for the preliminary hearing accounted for a further 10 ½ month delay.</p>
  <h2><i>Did the trial judge fail to balance the prejudice to the respondent
      with the societal interest in having a trial on the merits?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown submits that the actual prejudice the respondent suffered as
    a result of the delay as opposed to the charges against him was minimal.  He
    further submits that the trial judge erred in failing to balance the nature
    of the prejudice against the societal interest in having a trial on the merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was a significant amount of evidence of prejudice which was attributable
    to the delay as opposed to the charges themselves.  Indeed, there were three
    pages comprising eleven paragraphs in the respondent’s affidavit under the
    heading: “How the delay in this case has affected me”.  There was no challenge
    to this evidence by way of cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset of his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred to the legal
    principles, derived from <i>Morin</i> and other cases, which should govern
    his consideration of this case.  In particular, he said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada,
    on countless occasions, have reminded trial courts that s. 11(b) is designed
    to protect both the individual rights of an accused, and the rights of society,
    including the community’s interest in law enforcement, by having those who
    break the law tried quickly and having those accused of a crime dealt with
    fairly (see, for example, the Court of Appeal decision in <i>R. v. Queshi</i> (2004),
    190 C.C.C. (3d) 453 and the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>R. v.
    Morin</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3) 1).  As was observed by Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i>,
    it is now mandated that the assessment of whether an accused’s right to be
    tried within a reasonable time has been infringed involves the balancing
    of the interests that s. 11(b) is designed to protect against ‘…the factors
    which inevitably lead to delay or are otherwise the cause of delay’.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In that respect, the trial judge is obliged to enter
    upon a balancing exercise, which requires an analysis as to whether or not
    the delay experienced in any particular case is constitutionally unreasonable.  There
    are four factors, which are critical to this assessment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    length of the delay</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any
    waiver by the accused of the time periods involved;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>reasons
    for the delay; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any
    prejudice that the accused in fact or inferentially suffered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of prejudice, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court of Appeal reiterated in <i>R. v. Kovacs-Tator</i> (2004),
    192 C.C.C. (3d) 91 that an assessment of prejudice is a significant aspect
    of the analysis required in an application of this nature.  That being said,
    factors inherent in the criminal charge process in and of itself, such as
    the stigma of being charged, the terms of release, and the circumstances
    of arrest are not of direct concern.  It has also long been held, however,
    that prejudice can be inferred from the mere fact of an overall delay, even
    in the absence of actual prejudice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was well aware of his obligation to carry out the balancing exercise
    including his obligation to consider not only the rights of the individual
    accused but society’s interest in having persons charged with crime tried
    on the merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons for his ruling were delivered orally at the conclusion
    of a two day hearing.  In my view, those reasons make it clear that his analysis
    proceeded on a complete understanding of the correct legal principles which
    he applied to the facts as he found them.  He was obviously aware that prejudice
    to the accused is an important factor for consideration as is society’s interest
    in a trial on the merits.  As a result of his consideration of all of the
    evidence and the application of the approach mandated by Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i>,
    he concluded that the delay in this case was unreasonable and therefore trumped
    society’s interest in a trial on the merits.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    cannot, in the words of Arbour J.A. in <i>Bennett</i>, “lose sight of the
    importance of the total period of delay.”  The trial judge did not lose sight
    of it in this case.  He concluded that a total delay of 27&nbsp;½ months
    from arrest to the commencement of the trial was too long.  I agree with
    him.  As already indicated, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
