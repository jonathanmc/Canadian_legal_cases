  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sexual assault on June
    3, 2004.  He appeals both convictions and seeks a new trial on both.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s grounds of appeal fall into two groups. First, he challenges
    the trial judge’s evidentiary ruling admitting into evidence a statement
    given by him to police officers investigating the death of Ms. Jennifer Boczylo.
    On this point, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in ruling
    that he was not detained when he made the statement and that there was no
    violation of his rights under s. 10 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms. </i> Second, the appellant alleges that the trial judge erred
    in his instructions to the jury.  Specifically, he submits that the trial
    judge erred in his instructions as to the use that could be made of his statement,
    failed to adequately state the position of the defence, failed to charge
    the jury respecting intoxication in relation to first degree murder, and
    erred in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>II.        BACKGROUND</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Ms.
    Jennifer Boczylo lived alone in
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    apt. #6 at
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    19 Front St.,
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Trenton, a commercial building with apartments on the second floor.  She
    was last seen alive in the common hallway of her apartment building around
    midnight on Thursday, August 1, 2002. Frazier Frackleton, who occupied
    <st1:address
w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    apt. #4, testified that he heard someone being sick outside his apartment.
    Shortly after, he heard raised voices.  He last saw Ms. Boczylo when she
    intervened in an argument between himself and Michael Enright, a friend of
    the appellant who lived in
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    apt. #5.  She appeared to be trying to calm Enright down.  After five or
    ten minutes, Frackleton closed his door.   About a half hour later, Frackleton
    heard music come on in Enright’s apartment.  After the music stopped at 12:00
    or 12:30 a.m., Frackleton did not hear anything.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On
    Friday, August 2, 2002, Ms. Boczylo’s friend, Amanda Peever, attended Ms.
    Boczylos’s apartment and found that the door had apparently been kicked open.
    Parts of the lock were on the floor and there was a partial footwear impression
    on the door.  There was no evidence of any robbery.  Ms. Boczylo’s purse
    and personal effects were in the apartment as was her cell phone. Ms. Boczylo
    was absent. Ms. Peever reported Ms. Boczylo missing to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Around
    noon on Saturday, August 3, 2002, Ms. Boczylo’s body was found floating face
    down in the Trent River, approximately 200 yards upriver from the foot of
    the rear stairway to her apartment building. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    post-mortem examination conducted the next day identified drowning as the
    cause of death associated with blunt force injury to the head.  In addition
    to the extensive blunt force trauma to her head, Ms. Boczylo’s shoulders
    showed extreme and deep haemorrhaging consistent with her arms being pulled
    backward and forced up above her head. Although the post-mortem indicated
    Ms. Boczylo was alive when she entered the water, it could not reveal whether
    she was conscious or unconscious. Her hands had injuries consistent with
    offensive wounds received in fighting off an attacker and not consistent
    with having been sustained as a result of being in the river after her death
    by drowning. The case became an investigation of a “suspicious death”. The
    police interviewed a number of persons who knew Ms. Boczylo or had had contact
    with her, including the appellant.  No arrests were made.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Just
    over a month later, on September 13, 2002, the police received the result
    of the DNA test, showing the appellant’s semen in Ms. Boczylo’s mouth and
    stomach as well as in vomit collected from the catwalk at the rear of the
    apartment building. They arrested the appellant and charged him with Ms.
    Boczylo’s murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At
    trial, the Crown’s case depended to a significant degree on three pieces
    of circumstantial evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> <span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Expert
    evidence that the shoeprint on the door of the deceased’s apartment was similar
    to that made by a Wilson S7100 shoe owned by the appellant. A security video
    from Shopper’s Drug Mart showed the appellant wearing the shoes on August
    1, 2002 at 1:25 p.m.  In addition, the Crown led evidence that only sixty
    pairs of the S7100 shoe, ranging between size 9 and 12, were sold in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Belleville area.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> <span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Expert
    evidence that a drinking glass, found in the kitchen sink, had on it a fingerprint
    identified as coming from the appellant’s left middle finger. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> <span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Semen
    found in Ms. Boczylo’s mouth and stomach that matched the appellant’s DNA
    profile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When
    the trial began, the identity of the person who had had sexual contact with
    Ms. Boczylo was not admitted. Causation of death and, if the death was a
    homicide, the identity of the killer were in issue. The appellant did not
    testify. In oral submissions at the end of trial, the appellant’s counsel
    admitted the appellant had had oral sex with the deceased on the night in
    question but submitted the Crown had failed to prove the sex was non-consensual
    or that there was any link between the sex that had occurred and Ms. Boczylo’s
    death. The appellant’s counsel also relied on the fact that the body was
    found in the river upstream from the deceased’s apartment building and the
    absence of injury to the lower part of the deceased’s body to suggest that
    she was not forcibly dragged from her apartment building into the water. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant’s mother, Ms. Pomeroy, testified that her son returned to their
    home shortly after 12:00 a.m. on August 2.  In cross-examination, she stated
    that the time could not have been any later than 12:30 or 12:45 a.m.  The
    defence relied on her evidence to suggest that the appellant would not have
    had time to commit the crimes alleged and put the body in the water. Although
    the appellant’s statement made to police on August 4, 2002 was introduced
    into evidence by the Crown over the objection of the defence, the defence
    also relied on that statement as proof that the appellant had returned home
    around 12:30 a.m. while his mother was still up and would not have had time
    to commit the murder.  </p>

    Wilton testified that he telephoned the appellant at 1:35 p.m. on August
    4, 2002.  He told the appellant that the police were investigating the death
    of a girl and that his name had come up in speaking with people in and around
    the building at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    19 Front St.  He asked the appellant to attend at the police station, “to
    give any possible information that he knew about people and things happening
    around the building.” The appellant was very cooperative.  He stated that
    he would be right over.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Shortly
    after the phone call, the appellant walked to the police station and was
    taken to an interview room equipped with video recording equipment.  The

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    the Sherwood, a local bar, on the evening of August 1, 2002.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wilton was also aware that the appellant had a criminal record involving
    offences of violence and was bound by a probation order that included a term
    he not consume alcohol. The police decided to put the appellant, Enright
    and Harpell under surveillance on August 3 after the body of Ms. Boczylo
    was found.  However, because the Quinte Police Force was a small force with
    only one officer available for surveillance, the police placed the appellant
    under surveillance on the morning of August 4, just prior to the police interview.  Two
    days later, when the Quinte police force received assistance from neighbouring
    police forces, surveillance began on Enright and Harpell.  </p>

    the interview at the police station, the appellant was questioned about his
    movements on Thursday, August 1, 2002.  The appellant stated that he and
    Ron Harpell went to the Sherwood at around 12:30 p.m.  Harpell was buying
    drinks.  They were joined during the evening by Michael Enright.  Enright
    was drunk and was cut off by the bouncer.  They left around midnight and
    stopped to get some pizza.  The appellant declined to say whether he had
    been drinking or not, stating: “oh I can’t say whether I drank or not like,
    I’m not, I’m not allowed to drink, know what I mean?” The appellant stated
    that he accompanied Enright to
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    19 Front Street.  He stated that Enright was arguing with a neighbour about
    walking on his ceiling.   The appellant stated that a short blonde girl was
    also arguing with Enright.  The girl was dressed in a white terry cloth robe.  The
    appellant stated that he became sick and vomited.  After being sick, he spoke
    to the girl and she gave him a glass of water.  He stated that he did not
    go into the girl’s apartment, but that he was familiar with the girl, having
    seen her in the building.  He informed the police that he did not know her
    name and had “never partied with her”.  After he had the glass of water,
    he told P.C. Wilton that he left the building and returned home, arriving
    around 12:30 a.m.  P.C. Wilton testified there were no visible injuries on
    the appellant at the time of the interview.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The trial judge’s
      ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    ruling on the application for <i>Charter</i> relief, after referring to the
    factors set out in <i>R. v. Moran<b> </b></i>(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[6]       Even though the police ultimately intended
    to arrest and detain Mr. Pomeroy on his breach of probation, was he detained
    within the meaning of s. 10 of the <i>Charter</i> before 2:30 p.m. on August
    4, 2002?  More specifically was he detained between 13:43 and 14:30 on the
    said date when he spoke with the officers in response to their inquiries
    pertaining to the suspicious death of Ms. Boczylo? In my opinion he was not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[7]       It is important to remember at this juncture
    of the police investigation they had no reason to consider Mr. Pomeroy a
    suspect, and except for an apparent breaking and entry at Ms. Boczylo’s apartment
    there was no basis for any investigation other than the suspicion which surrounded
    Ms. Boczylo’s death.  The manner in which the interview of Mr. Pomeroy was
    undertaken obviates the aforesaid and demonstrates that the whole thrust
    of the police effort was to gather as much detail as to Mr. Pomeroy’s activities,
    as well as the names or descriptions of other witnesses he was able to provide,
    and who may or may not have been able to shed light on the matter.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[8]       Undoubtedly it was the officers’ intention
    and duty to arrest Mr. Pomeroy and detain him due to the likely breach of
    his terms of probation, as disclosed by his two friends, Enright and Harpell,
    in their description of the drinking spree at the Sherwood Hotel on August
    1 involving themselves and Mr. Pomeroy.  However, the primary reason for
    meeting with Mr. Pomeroy at the time and place in question was a suspicious
    death under investigation, and to me it was obvious the breach of probation
    charge was very secondary.  In these circumstances it was not incumbent on
    the officers to prioritize the secondary reason to meet Mr. Pomeroy so as
    to require his s. 10 rights in relation to the breach of probation charge
    to be dealt with immediately.  To have done so may have compromised, diminished
    or eliminated the willingness Mr. Pomeroy had demonstrated in cooperating
    as to the foremost concern of the police at the time.  In my view delaying
    the formal arrest and detention of Mr. Pomeroy for breach of probation was
    not a violation of his <i>Charter</i> protection, whereas the officers may
    have jeopardized the full, free, complete and willing exculpatory remarks
    received from Mr. Pomeroy concerning the suspicious death which was paramount,
    if they had done otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[9]       The objective of s. 10 is to assure trial
    fairness and eliminate any disadvantage to a citizen subjected to the direction
    or control of law enforcement personnel in relation to charges or potential
    charges against them.  Of course, in the discharge of their duties the police
    may interview anyone while investigating a matter.  When someone voluntarily,
    freely and willingly meets with and provides information to the police in
    the circumstances disclosed here, the obligations of the police set out in
    s. 10 regarding an outstanding ancillary offence are not triggered immediately
    and are properly adhered to when the formal arrest and detention takes place.  On
    the record before me there is no suggestion of compulsion, concern for freedom
    or unfairness of any kind to Mr. Pomeroy as to his engagement with the investigating
    officers in receiving the exculpatory statement he provided.   </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that an individual in the company of the police is physically
    detained where police have reasonable grounds to arrest him and the police
    have formed an intention to arrest him. I would reject the appellant’s submission
    for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    this court has already refused to extend the concept of detention to situations
    in which the police have authority to detain an individual in their company
    but have not yet exercised that authority: see <i>R. v. Hall</i> (2004),
    193 O.A.C. 7 at para 22. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant’s submission seeks to adopt too narrow an approach to the determination
    of detention.  The appellant focuses on only one criterion used to determine
    whether a detention exists, namely, whether the appellant was free to leave
    at the end of the interview. This approach ignores the vast body of jurisprudence
    which requires a contextual analysis and consideration of all the circumstances
    in determining whether a detention exists.  Further, the case law submitted
    by the appellant in support of his submission that he was detained is not
    applicable to the facts of this case. </p>
  <h3><i>(i)        Detention and police authority to detain an individual</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Therens</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613 and <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>, [1988] 1
      S.C.R. 640, the Supreme Court of Canada identified three situations that
      give rise to a detention: (1) where there is a deprivation of liberty by
      physical constraint; (2) when the police assume control over the movement
      of a person by a demand or direction which may have significant legal consequences
      and which prevents or impedes access to counsel; and (3) in situations
      where the person concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of
      liberty and reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does not
      exist (<i>i.e. </i>psychological detention).  It is the second situation
      that the appellant alleges gave rise to the detention in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts in <i>Hall </i>are instructive in assessing the alleged detention in
    this case.  The police obtained judicial warrants compelling the appellant
    to provide DNA samples and an impression of his hands but, rather than executing
    these warrants and compelling his attendance, the officers asked if he<b> </b>would
    agree to come to the station for an interview and provide the necessary samples.
    The police hoped that by keeping their relationship with Hall on a voluntary
    basis, he might provide further information that would assist them in their
    investigation.  After waiting for him to finish work the police accompanied
    him to the station. On the <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> the appellant said that
    he understood he had a choice whether to accompany the police or not and
    knew he could refuse to speak with them.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty
    J.A. rejected the appellant’s submission that he was detained simply because
    the police had the authority to detain him by virtue of the warrants and
    intended to exercise that authority if the appellant refused to cooperate.  At
    para. 22, he noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I see no reason in policy or logic to extend the
    concept of detention to situations in which the police have the authority
    to detain an individual, choose not to exercise that authority, and instead
    permit an individual to choose whether to voluntarily accede to a request
    from the police.  If detention is to have any meaning, it must involve the
    exercise of some power by a state authority over an individual’s liberty,
    or the reasonable apprehension of the exercise of such power.  Here, for
    tactical reasons, the police deliberately chose not to exercise that power….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty
    J.A. further held that the fact that the police would have executed the warrants
    if the appellant had refused to co-operate was irrelevant to whether his
    decision to co-operate was an informed one.  This was largely because the
    police had told the appellant en route to the station that he was a suspect,
    that he had the right to remain silent and that he had a right to counsel:
    see <i>Hall </i>at para. 23. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, while the interview took place in the police station, it is important
    to note that, prior to giving his statement, the appellant was not deprived
    of his liberty by physical restraint in the sense that he was neither handcuffed
    nor placed in a cell; nor was he subject to any form of direction by the
    police.  The police allegedly made a decision to arrest the appellant but
    did not act on that decision in the hope that by keeping the relationship
    on a voluntary basis as long as possible, he might provide information to
    assist them in their investigation. There is no evidence that the police
    gave him any demand or direction. There is no evidence that the appellant
    believed he had no choice but to comply with the police request to speak
    with them or that he believed his freedom had been restrained; the appellant
    concedes this.  As indicated by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Wilton, the appellant wanted to be
    “cooperative”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant understood that he could refuse to answer questions put to him
    and exercised that right at one point during the interview, refusing to answer
    whether he had been drinking on the night of August 1, 2002.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge viewed the videotape and found: that the appellant was well aware
    of his rights; that the thrust of the interview was to gather as much detail
    as to the appellant’s activities as he was able to provide, as well as the
    names or descriptions of other witnesses; and that all those associated with
    the building were interviewed. The fact that the police planned to arrest
    the appellant for breach of probation after the interview was irrelevant
    to whether he made an informed choice to talk to them about Ms. Boczylo.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the evidence does not support a distinction between
    the questioning in relation to the murder and the breach of probation because
    his movements on August 1, 2002 and association with Enright and Harpell
    were relevant to both. I disagree with this view.  At the time, there was
    no evidence to link the offence of breach of probation, for which the appellant
    was going to be arrested, and the suspicious death with respect to which
    he was being questioned. Further, as in <i>Hall</i>, the execution of the
    process authorized had not taken place at the time of the questioning.  The
    appellant has not provided any basis to discount his earlier decision to
    voluntarily cooperate with the police in their murder investigation simply
    because the police formed an intention to detain him at a later time on a
    comparatively minor matter. There is always the possibility that the police
    may have changed their mind about arresting him for breach of probation.
    A physical detention does not depend on the intention of the police but on
    their action in directing or taking control of a person. </p>
  <h3><i>(ii)       Detention as a contextual analysis</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    additional pitfall in the appellant’s argument is that he limits the analysis
    of whether there has been a physical detention to the single criterion of
    whether the appellant was entitled to leave at the end of the interview.  As
    a result, the detention analysis turns entirely on the knowledge or intention
    of the police.  While this is a factor that should be considered in the detention
    analysis, it should not form the entirety of the analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    analysis of whether an individual is detained is a contextual one.  In <i>R.
    v. Rajaratnam </i>(2006), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 547 at paras. 13-14 (Alta.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the court held that a trial judge has a duty to take into consideration
    all the circumstances in determining whether a person is detained when questioned
    by the police.  This approach was also advanced in <i>Moran</i>.  While that
    decision concerned an alleged psychological detention, the factors relevant
    to a contextual analysis remain relevant, as here, where an alleged physical
    detention is involved.  In this case, whether the appellant was escorted
    by a police officer or came himself in response to a police request is a
    consideration relating to physical detention, as is the question of whether
    the police gave a direction or assumed control over the appellant.  The stage
    of the investigation, the nature of police questioning and whether the police
    had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the individual had committed
    the crime being investigated are also relevant factors for consideration
    in any detention analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    absence of any “compulsion or coercion” by the police, such as a demand or
    direction, that could be said to constitute an interference with the appellant’s
    liberty or freedom of action during the course of the interview is a central
    factor supporting the conclusion that at the time of the interview the appellant
    was not detained: see <i>R. v. Therens </i>at p. 642; <i>R. v. Bazinet </i>(1986),
    25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 at 284 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Even if, in a broad sense, the appellant
    may have been a suspect at that time, that fact alone is not determinative
    of the question of whether he was detained: see <i>Moran </i>at p. 260.  </span>The
    rights conferred by s. 10 are not possessed by the individual who voluntarily
    chooses to cooperate with police: see Peter W. Hogg, <i>Constitutional Law
    of Canada, </i>vol. 2 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough: Carswell, 2002) (looseleaf) at 47-2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rights of a person upon arrest or detention under s. 10 of the <i>Charter</i> address
    specific aspects of the right not to be deprived<i> </i>of liberty and security
    of the person as protected by s. 7: <i>Reference re the Motor Vehicle Act
    (British Columbia) s. 94(2)</i>,<i> </i>[1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  The broader
    principle in s. 7 also requires a contextual analysis and further supports
    my conclusion that, irrespective of the type of detention alleged, a contextual
    analysis is required. For example, in <i>R. v. White</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R.
    417, a s. 7 case, Iacobucci J. held at para. 45:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principle against self-incrimination demands
    different things at different times, with the task in every case being to
    determine exactly what the principle demands, if anything, within <i>the
    particular context at issue</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge did conduct a contextual analysis that involved consideration
    of all the circumstances in coming to his conclusion and he was right to
    do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the interview, the police were still in the early stages of their
    investigation.  The DNA, footprint, and fingerprint analyses were still unavailable.  While
    the appellant was a person of interest to the police, they had no basis for
    considering him to be a suspect or for telling him that he was one.  In fact,
    according to P.C. Wilton, at that time there was “absolutely no information
    to implicate anyone as being a suspect”, nor was there evidence to support
    the conclusion that a crime had even occurred.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    focus of the interview was to gain general information as part of the investigation
    of the “suspicious death”; the questioning was not conducted for the purpose
    of obtaining incriminating statements from the appellant.  In many ways,
    the nature of the questioning was similar to that in <i>R. v. Caputo </i>(1997),
    114 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 11-12 (Ont. C.A.), in which Rosenberg J.A. upheld the
    trial judge’s determination that the appellant had not been detained in violation
    of his s. 10(b) rights when he made a statement to the police.  As in that
    case, the questioning here appears to have been general in nature and directed
    toward obtaining a witness statement from the appellant.  At no point during
    the interview did the police confront the appellant with evidence pointing
    to his guilt for sexual assault or murder.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, in assessing when a detention has occurred for the purpose of
    the <i>Charter, </i>the focus cannot be limited simply to the time at which
    the police make a decision to deprive the individual of his or her liberty.
    That approach improperly limits the entire focus to the perception or intention
    of the police. Rather, as in <i>Moran,</i> a broader contextual analysis
    that accounts for <i>all </i>relevant factors is required to ascertain whether
    an individual was detained. Thus, even if, as
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Wilton testified, the police decided to arrest the appellant midway through
    the interview for breach of probation, they did not exercise their power
    of arrest at that time.  A contextual analysis leads me to conclude that
    the appellant was not detained during the interview.  </p>
  <h3><i>(iii)     The jurisprudence relied on by the appellant does not apply
      to this case</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on <i>R. v. Voss </i>(1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 58 (Ont. C.A.),
    in support of his submission that he had the right to be advised of his right
    to counsel as required by s. 10(b) and that this right was violated.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Voss, </i>the
    accused had been in the company of the police officers for a number of hours
    and had given an exculpatory statement.  The court held that the case was
    not one of mere questioning by the police in fulfillment of their duties;
    rather, the accused was detained when the investigation changed from one
    of trying to determine the cause of death to one of trying to acquire incriminating
    statements from him. In those circumstances, Tarnopolsky J.A. held that the
    individual’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>rights must be extended to him.  However,
    Tarnopolsky J.A. characterized the initial part of the police interview as
    an instance of mere questioning by the police, in which case there was no
    requirement to inform the person being questioned of a right to counsel:
    see <i>Voss </i>at p. 73.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the nature of the police investigation did not change during the
    course of the police interview from one that involved mere questioning to
    acquire information about the suspicious death of Ms. Boczylo to one that
    became adversarial in nature.  When the atmosphere is adversarial in nature,
    the person involved is placed under emotional or psychological pressure:
    see <i>R. v. White </i>at para. 56<i>.  </i>That was not the situation here.  In
    such circumstances, the police had no obligation to extend to the appellant
    his s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>rights. The decision in <i>Voss </i>is distinguishable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    advancing his s. 10(b) argument, the appellant also relies on <i>R. v. Miller </i>(1991),
    5 O.R. (3d) 678 (C.A.), a decision in which<i> </i>the accused’s employer
    assisted the police in using a trick to obtain handwriting samples from the
    accused.  The question was whether the conduct of the police unfairly deprived
    the suspect of the right to choose whether to speak to the police and the
    court held it did not.  Here, the only “trickery” alleged is that the police
    proposed to arrest the appellant for breach of probation after they had questioned
    him. This is not a case of the police making a misrepresentation to a suspect
    or of detaining an individual on a relatively minor offence and using it
    as a pretext to question the individual about a serious one without giving
    him his rights before doing so.</p>
  <h3><i>(iv)      Violation of the appellant’s right to silence</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the alternative, the appellant submits that the conduct of the police in
    obtaining a statement from him without advising him of his true status contravened
    his right to silence.  It is well established that “[t]he residual protection
    afforded to the right to silence under s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>is only
    triggered upon detention”: see <i>R. v. Singh </i>(2007), 285 D.L.R. (4th)
    583 at para. 32 (S.C.C.).  See also <i>R. v. Osmar </i>(2007), 84 O.R. (3d)
    321<i> </i>at paras. 42-45 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), discussing <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.<i>  </i>As noted
    in <i>Singh </i>at para. 32, “the suspect’s situation is much different <i>after </i>detention” in
    that the suspect is more vulnerable and there is a heightened risk of abuse
    of power by the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>  </i>The
    appellant submits that <i>Osmar </i>leaves the door open to engaging the
    right to silence short of detention.  In <i>Osmar, </i>although Rosenberg
    J.A. recognized that the right to silence may be extended to cases where
    the accused is not in detention, he confines this to situations in which
    the accused “was nevertheless under the control of the state in circumstances
    functionally equivalent to detention and equally needing protection from
    the greater power of the state.”  It should be noted that in <i>Osmar, </i>the
    appellant’s statements were made in the context of an undercover police operation
    when the appellant was a suspect in two murders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the circumstances do not support the conclusion that the police
    interview constituted the functional equivalent of a detention.  The appellant
    was clearly aware that he was speaking with police officers when he provided
    his statement, he was not, at that time, a suspect and he wanted to be cooperative.  Most
    significantly, he was not detained at the time he provided the statement.  Thus,
    the concerns respecting abuse of police power and vulnerability that normally
    support the provision of the s. 7 right were not engaged.  In the circumstances,
    it is not open to this court to reject the detention requirement before requiring
    the police to inform the appellant of his s. 7 right to silence.  </p>

    to the jury and is an important aspect of counsel’s conduct of the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was some confusion during the pre-charge conference. A number of times defence
    counsel focused on the evidence of the appellant’s mother, Ms. Pomeroy, and
    stated that there should be no charge in respect of fabrication in relation
    to her statement.  The Crown agreed and indicated that he was simply going
    to suggest that her alibi evidence was false. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge clarified that his main concern was the use that the jury could
    make of the appellant’s statement.  If the jury came to the conclusion that
    the appellant’s statement was made to fabricate or mislead, he was uncertain
    whether the jury should be charged on the law relating to fabrication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown suggested that a fabrication instruction was appropriate.  This is
    indicated at two points within the pre-charge conference. The Crown enunciated
    the following position in reference to the appellant’s statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If in fact it was an alibi which was fabricated
    to mislead the police, then I think you can give them the fabrication instruction
    – the standard fabrication instruction.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Subsequently, the Crown seems to
    have reinforced this position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’d agree with what Your Honour said initially
    about the statement.  That would be our submission in a nutshell.  If he’s
    making it up to say, “I didn’t know her”, to distance himself from the offence,
    when clearly we can establish that he did have contact with her by virtue
    of the DNA, then in my respectful submission the jury would be entitled to
    conclude that evidence was fabricated.  And it’s tantamount to alibi evidence.  He’s
    saying “I didn’t know her”.            </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence asked the trial judge to tell the jury that it could choose to believe
    some, part or none of the appellant’s statement and also asked the trial
    judge to give the standard charge as established by the Supreme Court in <i>R.
    v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,  in relation to the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the pre-charge conference, the trial judge stated that he would
    leave the issue of fabrication for consideration after closing submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his closing statement to the jury, the Crown made a number of references
    to the appellant’s semen found in Ms. Boczylo’s mouth and stomach.  He connected
    this evidence to the appellant’s statement to emphasize that the appellant
    had lied to conceal his guilt.  For example, at one point in his closing,
    Crown counsel stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If Mr. Pomeroy had consensual sex with Jennifer
    Boczylo as is now being suggested may have been the case because we didn’t
    prove otherwise, then why did he lie to the police?.... He lied to the police
    about that because he didn’t know that science would prove him wrong.  Watch
    that video again knowing now what you know about his semen in her mouth and
    body.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He made those statements to the police because
    it was extremely important for him to distance himself from Jennifer.  He
    wanted to actively mislead the police in their investigation into the death
    of this young girl.  He wanted to shield himself from the police’s scrutiny.  He
    wanted the police to focus on someone other than him.  And he wanted all
    of that because he’s guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    closing submissions the trial judge provided a copy of his charge to the
    defence and Crown. That copy, like his charge, did not contain an instruction
    on fabrication as the Crown had requested in the pre-charge conference. The
    Crown did not follow up on his request that the trial judge include the fabrication
    instruction in the charge.  Nor was the issue of what use the jury could
    make of the appellant’s statement revisited prior to the trial judge’s charge
    to the jury.  <span>  </span> </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellant] lied to the police about the sexual

    was evidence that the appellant’s statement was fabricated and the circumstances
    warranted a fabrication instruction. However, on the particular facts of
    this case, the trial judge’s omission to provide such instruction does not
    lead me to conclude that the appeal should be allowed on this basis and a
    new trial ordered. I elaborate on my conclusion below.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>(1)       Was there evidence that the appellant’s
        statement was fabricated?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision in <i>O’Connor</i> sets out the current position of the law with
    respect to fabrication.  When the accused does not testify, and the Crown
    seeks to introduce evidence to demonstrate that the accused’s statement was
    fabricated, the trial judge must make a preliminary determination that there
    is evidence of fabrication that, if accepted, could reasonably support a
    finding of fabrication.  If an inference of fabrication is not available,
    there is no purpose in the Crown proving that the accused made a false statement.  A
    preliminary determination of fabrication was not sought or made in this case.
    However, because I am of the opinion that such evidence did exist, the omission
    of the Crown to seek such a determination is of no import.  <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    policy reasons, a finding of fabrication must be founded on evidence that
    is independent of the evidence discrediting the accused’s statement: see <i>O’Connor </i>at
    para. 21. Evidence discrediting the accused’s statement that he went home
    and had nothing to do with Ms. Boczylo after she gave him a glass of water
    is the evidence that the appellant’s DNA profile matched the DNA evidence
    found in Ms. Boczylo’s mouth and stomach. Thus, evidence of fabrication in
    this case is required to be evidence separate from the DNA evidence. In <i>O’Connor </i>at
    paras. 31 and 35, the court held that where an accused person does not testify
    at his or her trial and has made an out-of-court statement that is found
    to be untrue, the jury may consider the circumstances in which the false
    statement was made and the detailed nature of the statement as evidence of
    fabrication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as in <i>O’Connor, </i>the appellant’s statement to the police
    was made at a time when the police did not suspect the appellant and the
    appellant did not have reason to believe that he was a suspect.  The police
    were questioning all those who had seen the appellant the night before Ms.
    Boczylo disappeared.  The appellant’s statement proffered an alibi that,
    if true, would lead the police to conclude that he had not been involved
    with Ms. Boczylo after he saw her in the hallway.  That statement also contained
    very precise detail: Ms. Boczylo gave him a glass of water while he stood
    in the hallway; he told her not to worry as Enright was just drunk; after
    listening to the argument about two minutes, he said he was going home and
    did so; he arrived home at about 12:30 a.m. while his mother was still up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the jury disbelieved the appellant’s statement, they could ask themselves
    why the appellant would tell such detailed and specific lies to the police
    investigating her death. The fact the statement was made in circumstances
    prior to the appellant being aware he was a suspect and its specific reference
    to time is evidence from which a jury could draw an inference that the appellant
    fabricated his statement in order to mislead the police and to divert suspicion
    from himself.  Thus, the preliminary requirement for allowing the Crown to
    introduce the statement into evidence was met.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       What is the effect of the trial judge’s omission to charge

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the Crown’s closing and the trial judge’s repetition of it in his charge,
    the circumstances warranted an instruction on fabrication.  In particular,
    the members of the jury should have been cautioned that mere disbelief of
    the appellant’s statement did not entitle them to infer that the appellant
    was guilty of the crimes with which he was charged without first being satisfied
    of two things: independent evidence of fabrication and a finding that the
    appellant made up his version of events because he was aware he had done
    what was alleged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the fact that the trial judge did not charge on fabrication, the
    trial judge no doubt thought he did not have to clearly set out the difference
    between evidence leading only to disbelief of the accused’s statement (<i>i.e.</i> the
    DNA evidence concerning the appellant’s semen) and the evidence capable of
    constituting independent evidence of fabrication (<i>i.e.</i> the fact that
    the accused was not a suspect at the time he gave the statement and the detailed
    nature of the statement respecting time). As Doherty J.A. observed in <i>R.
    v. Teske </i>(2005), 202 O.A.C. 239 at para. 84, Canadian courts alone have
    developed an elaborate and confusing set of instructions to be given to juries
    when charging on
    “consciousness of guilt”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also note that since <i>O’Connor, </i>the Supreme Court of Canada has
    rendered its decision in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787<i>.  </i>In
    that case, Charron J. held that in deciding whether a hearsay statement should
    be admitted for the truth of its contents, the relevant factors in determining
    admissibility should not be categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate
    reliability, nor should the presence of corroborating evidence be restricted
    only to circumstances surrounding the making of the statement.  Instead,
    both the circumstances existing at the time the statement is made and any
    other indicators of reliability should be considered. One reason she gave,
    at para. 100 of her reasons, is this: “It has proven difficult and at times
    counterintuitive to limit the inquiry to the circumstances surrounding the
    making of the statement.” In addition, she rejected the rationale that it
    would involve “bootstrapping” to admit the statement based on other evidence
    that was shown to be reliable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    oral argument in this appeal, the appellant’s counsel was asked whether the
    rationale articulated in <i>Khelawon </i>meant that the rules respecting
    fabrication should be reconsidered. Counsel chose not to address that issue
    and it was not pursued. Thus, I leave that issue for another day. For purposes
    of this appeal, the trial judge was not excused from explaining to the jury
    the requirement of independent evidence of fabrication and that, although
    it was for the members of the jury to decide, such evidence could be found
    in the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also had to instruct the jury it must find the appellant made
    up his version of events because he was aware of doing what was alleged.  In
    this regard, the trial judge’s <i>W.(D.) </i>instruction and his repeated
    instruction to the members of the jury that they must consider all of the
    evidence goes some way to attenuating his omission in this regard.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, in <i>R. v. Figueroa</i> (2008),<i> </i>233 O.A.C. 176, Doherty
    J.A. expanded on the role of post-offence conduct and the inferences that
    the trier of fact may draw in relation to such evidence at paras. 33-34: <a name="ORIGHIT_7"></a><a name="HIT_7"></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Post-offence conduct, including lies to the police,
    is a kind of circumstantial evidence.  The jury is asked to infer the existence
    of a fact in issue, <i>e.g.</i> the identity of the perpetrator, from post-offence
    conduct committed by the accused, <i>e.g. </i>lies to the police.  The inference
    is permissible only if, based on human experience and common sense, that
    inference is a reasonable one….  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a matter of human experience and common sense,
    Figueroa’s lies to the police were reasonably capable of supporting the inference
    that he was criminally involved in Mrs. Wong’s death.  A reasonable jury
    could infer that Figueroa lied to the police as to his whereabouts on February
    11 because he was involved in Mrs. Wong’s death….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    too, here, as a matter of human experience and common sense, the appellant’s
    lies to the police were reasonably capable of supporting the inference that
    he was  involved in criminal activity respecting Ms. Boczylo. While the appellant’s
    statement, when considered with the rest of the Crown’s case, cried out for
    an explanation, none was forthcoming. Rather, the defence position was at
    least partly maintained by the appellant’s mother’s evidence at trial.  The
    combined effect of the Crown evidence created a powerful inference that Ms.
    Boczylo did not engage in consensual sex with the appellant: the expert evidence
    concerning the shoeprint, the fingerprint evidence, the DNA evidence, the
    evidence in the 39-year-old appellant’s statement to the police that he and
    the 18-year-old victim were bare acquaintances, and the unlikelihood that
    an interloper severely beat Ms. Boczylo on the very same night.  That inference,
    in turn gave rise to a compelling inference of a motive for murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while it would clearly have been preferable for the trial judge to charge
    the jury on fabrication, I am of the view that the verdict would inevitably
    have been the same. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

      paras. 35-37, Doherty J.A. observed that there are occasions when post-offence
      conduct may reasonably support an inference that an accused was involved
      in criminal conduct but may provide no reasonable inference as to the nature
      of that conduct or the accused’s state of mind at the relevant time. He
      noted that in<i> R. v. White,</i> [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72,<i> </i>Major J. described
      the circumstances in which the jury should be told that the accused’s after-the-fact
      conduct has no probative value as to the nature of his participation or
      state of mind.  Those circumstances are most likely to arise when, as in <i>R.
      v. Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, the accused admits committing the <i>actus

    his counsel, in oral submissions at trial, did suggest that consensual sexual
    relations had taken place. In this context, the jury was entitled to consider
    the appellant’s statement on the question of motive.  The person who committed
    the sexual assault had a motive to kill in order to cover-up the sexual assault

    of his position that the appellant had not received a fair trial because
    of the trial judge’s failure to adequately review the defence position: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       The trial judge failed to identify the
    pieces of evidence supporting the defence position;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       The trial judge failed to express in
    plain language that the defence position was essentially that there was an
    absence of evidence to make out the Crown’s case; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       The trial judge improperly relied on
    defence counsel’s failure to submit a detailed position to avoid responsibility
    to fully and fairly review that position. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    brief, my response to these arguments is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       Reversible error based on the omission
    of the trial judge to review the evidence in his charge occurs, “…<i>only </i>where
    the single item of evidence in question is the foundation of the defence”:
    see <i>R. v. Daley </i>(2007), 226 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 55.  Here, the
    trial judge did review the evidence on which the foundation of the defence
    rested, namely, the evidence of Ms. Pomeroy and the appellant’s statement.
    The trial judge’s omission to review other parts of the defence closing suggesting
    that the Crown had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt was not
    an error because those submissions were based on speculation.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       Similarly, the trial judge was not obliged
    to review the alleged gaps in the Crown’s case because they were either speculative
    or did not relate to what the Crown was required to prove. The trial judge’s
    repeated instruction to consider all the evidence and to consider it as a
    whole was sufficient to suggest that the absence of evidence had to be factored
    into the reasonable doubt assessment: see <i>R. v. Archer </i>(2005), 202
    C.C.C. (3d) 60 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 40. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       Trial judges are entitled to expect the
    assistance of counsel. Counsel’s lack of assistance does not, of course,
    absolve the trial judge of the duty to present the defence position to the
    jury. An appellate court’s assessment of the fairness of the charge is not,
    however, restricted to what the trial judge said about the defence position.
    It is the charge as a whole that must be considered.  When considered as
    a whole, despite its manifest facial imbalance, the charge was not substantively
    unfair to the appellant because it allowed the jury to appreciate the issues
    and the defence presented. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>I will elaborate.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span

        that was the foundation for the defence position? </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Case
    law has established that, while the trial judge’s charge must be balanced,
    even-handed and present fairly the positions of the Crown and defence, no
    set format is required as to how that is accomplished: see <i>R. v. Varcoe </i>(1996),

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Thus, simply because the trial judge did not specifically review the
    evidence in support of the defence position when outlining that position
    in the charge does not render the charge imbalanced. It is the charge as
    a whole that must be considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foundation of the defence position was the evidence of Ms. Pomeroy and the
    appellant’s statement.  While the trial judge did not review this evidence
    when setting out the defence position, he did refer to it numerous times
    in his charge. For example, he referred to the appellant’s statement and
    the evidence of Ms. Pomeroy when instructing the jury on whether the appellant
    caused Ms. Boczylo’s death unlawfully.  Reference to this evidence was repeated
    when the trial judge reviewed the state of mind required for murder and when
    he reviewed the evidence of whether the appellant committed a sexual assault
    on Ms. Boczylo. The trial judge also reviewed the evidence of Ms. Pomeroy
    in detail in his seriatim review of the evidence at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn now to the position of the defence respecting the absence of evidence.
    In his closing, defence counsel made much of the fact that P.C. Wilton observed
    no bruising or scratches on the appellant when he gave his statement.  He
    emphasized that such injuries would have been obvious to an experienced investigator
    such as
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wilton, particularly since the appellant was in shorts and a t-shirt when
    he arrived at the police station.  If this evidence had been reviewed with
    the jury, its effect would likely have been substantially weakened for the
    defence.  For example, after reviewing this point with the jury, the trial
    judge would also have had to draw the jury’s attention to the absence of
    evidence in respect of the appellant’s attire on the night in question.  He
    could have been wearing long sleeves, which would have protected him from
    receiving bruises or scratches from the deceased.  The trial judge would
    also have been required to identify any evidence describing the height and
    weight differential between the parties.   In any event, the trial judge’s
    failure to review this is insufficient on its own to set aside the convictions,
    particularly since this point had already been stressed to the jury during
    the defence closing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same can be said of Ms. Pomeroy’s evidence that the appellant was not wet
    when he returned home.  This evidence was also stressed to the jury during
    the defence closing.  In addition, the strength of this submission is negligible
    since Ms. Boczylo’s body was found in shallow water and there was no evidence
    as to why the appellant could not simply have removed his shoes and socks
    and rolled up his pant legs when putting the body in the water.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the defence closing was largely founded on speculative theories: a) the presence
    of sperm in Ms. Boczylo’s stomach indicated that the sexual contact was consensual;
    b) Harpell as an alternative perpetrator; c) death by drowning was due to
    suicide; and d) cause of death from “immersion syndrome”.  If the trial judge
    had reviewed these speculative theories with the jury, he would have likely
    confused the jury about the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
    which is to flow from the presence or absence of evidence, and cannot be
    based on something else, such as speculation: see <i>R. v. Carriere </i>(2001),
    159 C.C.C. (3d) 51 at para. 35 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ).  I will elaborate below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Presence
      of sperm in the stomach</i>:<i> </i>At the end of trial, faced with the
      DNA evidence of the appellant’s semen in Ms. Boczylo’s mouth and stomach,
      defence counsel submitted to the jury that the appellant had had consensual
      sex with her.  The basis for his submission was that, as Ms. Boczylo had
      the appellant’s semen in her mouth and stomach, she had swallowed it, that
      any swallowing was done voluntarily, and she had therefore consented to
      oral sex. There is no evidentiary support, medical or otherwise, for the
      proposition that if all semen has not been spit out consensual oral sex
      has occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Harpell
      was the perpetrator</i>:<i> </i>In his address to the jury, defence counsel
      pointed to Harpell as an individual who might have been responsible for
      Ms. Bocyzlo’s death.  He mentioned that Harpell committed suicide in February
      2004 and asked whether the timing of the suicide might be related to the
      prosecution.  However, given that there was no evidence connecting Harpell
      in any way to the death of Ms. Boczylo, it would have been inappropriate
      for the trial judge to review this defence theory with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Death
      by suicide</i>:<i> </i>On numerous occasions during his closing argument,
      defence counsel emphasized his position that the Crown had failed to prove
      Ms. Boczylo’s death resulted from being intentionally drowned.  In particular,
      defence counsel relied on the absence of injuries below Ms. Boczylo’s waist
      or on her neck, stating that if she had been dragged or pulled, she would
      normally have had bruises on those parts of her body. There was also an
      absence of any evidence of screams heard by anyone in the surrounding area.  Further,
      the evidence was that her injuries were not so serious that they would
      have required hospitalization.  Lastly, he suggested that the set of keys
      located in the pocket of the deceased’s track pants suggested that she
      voluntarily chose to leave the apartment that night for some reason and
      lock the door behind her.  In essence, defence counsel relied on this evidence
      to argue that Ms. Boczylo voluntarily entered the water on the evening
      in question and drowned herself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    position stands in stark contrast to the evidence provided by Dr. Hunt, who
    testified that the cause of death was drowning associated with blunt force
    trauma.  The blunt force trauma was characterized by the doctor as “significant”,
    being present in the upper part of the body, the head area and on the joints
    of the shoulders.  He also observed bruising to Ms. Boczylo’s face and significant
    abrasions and bruising on the back of the left arm and some of her fingers,
    consistent with offensive wounds received in fighting off her attacker.  Dr.
    Hunt confirmed that the wounds and injuries to Ms. Boczylo’s body were not
    consistent with having been sustained as a result of being in the river after
    her death by drowning.  These were not self-inflicted injuries.  The defence
    failed to acknowledge such evidence, which established overwhelmingly that
    the death by drowning was intentional.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Vagal
      reflux</i>:<i> </i>Defence counsel also advanced the position that Ms.
      Boczylo’s death may have been the result of “immersion syndrome”, involving
      vagal stimulation which can cause the heart to simply stop.  He suggested
      that this might be a plausible explanation for how she drowned in shallow
      water.  He also suggested that this reaction might arise from extreme fright,
      which also causes a vagal reflux.  There was no evidence that Ms. Boczylo
      was conscious when she entered the water. If she was, defence counsel’s
      submissions implicitly raised the question, “Who caused the extreme fright?”      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    position advanced by the defence on these points was entirely speculative.  In
    such circumstances, the trial judge was not obliged to review defence counsel’s
    submissions with the jury.  For these reasons, it is my view that the trial
    judge did not fail to identify a piece of evidence that was the foundation
    of the defence position.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)</span></i><span lang=EN-US>       <i>Did
        the trial judge fail to express in plain language that the defence position
        was essentially that there was an absence of evidence to make out the
        Crown’s case? </i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    this is not a situation where the trial judge failed to identify evidence,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge omitted to emphasize for the jury
    the absence of evidence to make out the Crown’s case.  I would reject this
    submission for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in reviewing the position of the defence, the trial judge did tell the jury
    that the defence position was that the Crown had not established each essential
    element of the offence of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.  He
    also alluded to this position in other parts of the charge.  For example,
    at one point the trial judge noted: “There is no statement, written record
    or witnesses who state that Mark Alan Pomeroy intended to kill Jennifer Boczylo
    or cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause her death, and
    whether death ensued or not.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the absence of evidence relied upon by the defence was either speculative
    or did not represent an essential element of the case that the Crown was
    required to prove.  I have already discussed most of the alleged omissions
    in the charge respecting the defence position above. Other evidence that
    the appellant submits is a gap in the Crown’s case does not form part of
    the essential elements of the case or relate to the issue of identity and
    therefore cannot be considered a gap.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, the appellant points out that the trial judge did not tell the jury,
    as defence counsel did in his address, that Ms. Boczylo’s body was found
    200 yards upstream from the rear of her apartment complex and did not have
    any injuries to the lower part of her body, making it unlikely that she had
    been dragged to the water.  This “gap” dealt with the absence of any explanation
    of how Ms. Boczylo’s body got into the water. It related to the submission
    that she voluntarily entered the water and killed herself. As noted, <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>on
    any realistic view of the evidence, the medical evidence as to the nature
    and number of the injuries sustained by the deceased, particularly the blow
    to the head, virtually ruled out the possibility of suicide. Otherwise,</span> the
    alleged gap in the Crown’s case served no function in that it did not relate
    to what the Crown was required to prove, namely, the identity of the murderer
    and the essential elements of the offence.  As a result, the trial judge
    had no obligation to review this evidence in the charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge’s repeated direction to the jury to consider <i>all </i>the
    evidence may be relied upon as an instruction to the jury to account as well
    for the absence of evidence available to make out the offence.  In <i>Archer, </i>Doherty
    J.A. determined that the trial judge did not commit reversible error by failing
    to tell the jury that reasonable doubt could arise from the absence of evidence.  Rather,
    he found that the trial judge’s reference to “the evidence considered as
    a whole” was sufficient to suggest that gaps and silences in the evidence
    must be factored into the reasonable doubt assessment: see <i>Archer </i>at
    para. 40.  Similarly, in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury on
    multiple occasions to consider <i>all </i>the evidence, or the “cumulative
    effect” of the evidence, when reviewing each element of the offence.  Moreover,
    in his recharge to the jury the trial judge stated that the omission of evidence
    could give rise to a reasonable doubt; that charge must be considered as
    a whole.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the trial judge told the jury that they were to rely on their own recollections
    in deciding the case. These instructions further temper concerns about omissions
    from the summary of evidence for the defence: see <i>Daley </i>at para. 80.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the trial judge’s omission to refer to these aspects of the
    defence submissions did not constitute an error.  The cumulative effect of
    defence counsel’s submissions and the trial judge’s instructions were sufficient
    to convey to the jury that gaps and silences in the evidence must be factored
    into their assessment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the trial
        judge abdicate his responsibility to fully and fairly review the position
        of the defence?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the trial judge requested that the Crown and defence submit their
    positions in writing in advance of the charge.  Defence counsel declined
    to comply with this request stating simply that it was his position that
    the Crown had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Crown
    counsel quite clearly provided a detailed position which was subsequently
    reviewed with the jury by the trial judge in the charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s charge respecting the position of the defence was as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence position simply put is that the Crown
    has not met the onus upon it in that it has not established beyond a reasonable
    doubt each of the essential elements of the offence to enable you to reach
    a verdict of guilty on either of the charges against Mr. Pomeroy as described
    in Counts 1 and 2.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>He went on to refer to the appellant’s
    statement in which he indicated that he was home by midnight or shortly thereafter
    and provided a <i>W.(D.) </i>pattern instruction.  He concluded<b> </b>by
    emphasizing that the burden was on the Crown to prove that the appellant
    had committed the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.  Finally, the trial
    judge cautioned the members of the jury they should not consider individual
    pieces of evidence in isolation and told them that the Crown would not have
    discharged its burden of proof unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the guilt of the appellant was the only rational conclusion to
    be drawn from the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury, defence counsel complained that although
    the trial judge had referred to all the evidence in support of the Crown’s
    position, the trial judge had failed to summarize the evidence in support
    of the defence position, “that would make it unlikely or inconsistent that
    it was an intentional killing or the reasons why it would be unlikely to
    have been a non-consensual sexual assault.” Defence counsel did not assist
    the trial judge by specifying what aspects of the evidence in support of
    the defence position the trial judge had failed to summarize.  The trial
    judge declined to recharge the jury.  However, he later recharged the jury
    that the omission of evidence could also give rise to a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to account for the perceived
    imbalance that would be created by reviewing, in great detail, the evidence
    supporting the Crown’s position and, following that, by defining the defence
    position as simply that the Crown had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    outline the theories or positions of each party: see <i>R. v. Cooper, </i>[1980]
    1 S.C.R. 1149.  The practice of requiring counsel to submit their theories
    in writing to the trial judge in advance of their addresses to the jury has
    received judicial approval: see<i> R. v. B.(O.) </i>(1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d)
    531 at 551 (N.S.C.A.).  Generally, the trial judge should ensure that his
    descriptions of the competing theories at trial are of approximately the
    same length so there is no perceived imbalance: see <i>B.(O.) </i>at p. 551.  However,
    where the case for the Crown is more complex and the defence is simple, it
    is inappropriate to measure the fairness of the charge by reference to quantity:
    see <i>R. v. Olsen </i>(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 355 at para. 22 (Ont.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the trial judge spends “more time” in reviewing the evidence of
    the Crown will <i>not </i>compromise the <i>fairness </i>of the charge where
    the Crown has called more witnesses: see <i>R. v. Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1
    S.C.R. 652.  In <i>Thatcher, </i>the Supreme Court rejected the appellant’s
    submission that the trial judge’s charge was unfair as it failed to adequately
    summarize the defence position.  At pp. 702-703, the Court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence evidence was simple, however, and the
    Crown’s case was complex, relying on circumstantial evidence from a large
    number of witnesses.  It is simply inappropriate to try to measure the fairness
    of the charge by reference to quantity.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the trial judge gave a fair picture
    of the defence.  As Lord Goddard C.J., in <i>R. v. Clayton-Wright</i> (1948),
    33 Cr. App. R. 22 at p. 29, states, a trial judge is not required “to paint
    in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used ….”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as in <i>Thatcher, </i>the case for the Crown relied on circumstantial
    evidence from a number of witnesses.  In contrast, the position of the defence
    was straightforward and the evidence in support of it limited to calling
    one relatively brief witness, the appellant’s mother.  As a result, the perceived
    imbalance in the charge was more of a quantitative imbalance than a qualitative
    one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    courts must adopt a functional approach to reviewing jury charges.  The purpose
    of such review is to ensure that juries are properly – not perfectly – instructed.
    In conducting an appellate review, the Supreme Court emphasizes in <i>Daley</i> at
    para. 57:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The extent to which the evidence must be reviewed “will
    depend on each particular case. The test is one of fairness. The accused
    is entitled to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence.  So long
    as the evidence is put to the jury in a manner that will allow it to fully
    appreciate the issues and the defence presented, the charge will be adequate” [Citations
    omitted]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    functional approach also requires the appellate court not to divorce the
    jury charge from the greater context of the trial.  The comments of counsel
    during their addresses, including comments on legal issues should also be
    considered in assessing whether the charge is adequate: see <i>Daley </i>at
    para. 58.  Here, despite its facial imbalance, the trial judge’s charge to
    the jury, when considered together with the closing addresses of counsel,
    provided the jury with an appreciation of the factual issues to be resolved,
    the evidence relating to the issues, the proper law to be applied, and the
    positions of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  In
    addition, the Crown’s evidence at trial established a compelling circumstantial
    case against the appellant.  The fact that the appellant did not testify
    left unexplained a number of incriminating circumstances, including a shoe
    print on the broken door to Ms. Boczylo’s apartment which was consistent
    with shoes worn by the appellant and the injuries to her mouth and body indicating
    that the sexual contact was not consensual nor caused by being in the water.  The
    trial judge’s charge to the jury on the defence position was circumscribed
    by the appellant’s failure to point to any evidence explaining much of the
    incriminating evidence tendered by the Crown.  Defence counsel’s address
    skilfully attempted to raise a reasonable doubt but, as I have indicated,
    involved a great deal of speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overall,
    in the context of the trial, the charge was not unfair. </p>

    would not be relevant to constructive first degree murder. Thus, the question
    of whether intoxication should have been put before the jury as a defence
    is only relevant insofar as there was a burden on the Crown to prove the
    intent for murder. If the jury had been charged on intoxication, and assuming
    that it had found the appellant was the person who applied blunt force trauma
    to the victim’s head and placed her face down in the water, it would have
    had to determine whether the appellant was so intoxicated that he could not
    foresee that she would drown. If the jury had had a reasonable doubt on this

    1 S.C.R. 29 at 60, it would not be consistent with the proper administration

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    further question is whether an evidentiary basis existed to put the defence
    of intoxication to the jury. An evidentiary basis is critical because it
    makes no sense for a trial judge to invite the jury to consider defences
    for which there is no evidence or that cannot reasonably be inferred from
    the evidence: see <i>R. v. Squire, </i>[1977] 2 S.C.R. 13 at 19.  There is,
    to some degree, an evidentiary burden imposed on the accused in this respect.  As
    noted by Finlayson J.A. in <i>R. v. McKinnon</i> (1989), 33 O.A.C. 114 at
    para. 24 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While it is clear that the burden of proving guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt always rests on the Crown, there must be some point
    in a trial where absent any evidence in the existing trial record, the accused
    must submit evidence to form some factual basis for a defence of diminished
    capacity or capability based on intoxication.  This is an evidentiary burden….
    It is not the responsibility of the trial judge to conjure up defences which
    have no basis in fact in the evidence [citations omitted]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Daley </i>at
    para. 44, Bastarache J., speaking for the majority, identified the “threshold”
    for instructing juries on the intoxication defence as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The threshold for instructing juries on intoxication
    was set out in <i>Robinson, </i>at para. 48: “[B]efore a trial judge is required
    by law to charge the jury on intoxication, he or she must be satisfied that
    the effect of the intoxication was such that its effect might have impaired
    the accused’s foresight of consequences sufficiently to raise a reasonable
    doubt” (emphasis deleted).  This is the threshold for instructing juries
    on advanced drunkenness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    speaking of intoxication that impairs the accused’s foresight of the consequences
    of his or her act sufficiently to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether
    an accused had the <i>mens rea </i>necessary for a specific intent offence,
    Bastarache J. observed at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is important to recognize that the extent of
    intoxication required to advance a successful intoxication defence of this
    type may vary, depending on the type of offence involved….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For certain types of homicides, where death is
    the obvious consequence of the accused’s act, an accused might have to establish
    a particularly advanced degree of intoxication to successfully avail himself
    or herself of an intoxication defence of this type. </p>

    evidence provided by P.C. Wilton and Sgt. Menard was that the appellant had
    been at the Sherwood drinking on the date in question.  This information
    came from statements provided by the appellant’s companions Enright and Harpell.  Neither
    Enright nor Harpell testified at trial and the statements they provided to

    been served to the appellant. There was no suggestion that the appellant’s
    memory of the events of that evening was impaired.  To the contrary, in his
    statement, the appellant recalled that Enright had been cut off by the bouncer
    at the bar and he related the events at the apartment building afterwards
    with precise detail.  Although the appellant’s mother testified that she
    could not say whether her son’s breath smelled of alcohol or not because
    she had broken her nose, she did not testify that he exhibited other classic
    signs of alcohol impairment, such as slurred speech, glassy eyes, or difficulty
    walking. Rather, she testified that upon his return home the appellant appeared
    normal. While she said that the appellant had indicated to her that he was “sick”,
    she did not suggest that it was due to alcohol consumption.  There was also
