    appellants applied for admission to the Masters of Science in Biology Program
    at Laurentian University under the supervision of Professor Michael Persinger.  Their
    applications were denied by the Oversight Committee of the Department of
    Biology and its Dean.  They were denied on the basis that the appellants – who
    were otherwise academically acceptable –
    were not able to comply with the Department’s policy with respect to the
    availability of funding from faculty research grants.</p>

  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants had completed undergraduate biology degrees at Laurentian University
    and, in April 2006, applied to the University’s two-year Masters of Science
    in Biology Program.  Their proposed supervisor was Dr. Persinger, who was
    prepared to assume that role.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with the Department of Biology’s application review process, an
    Internal Committee comprised of Dr. Persinger and other faculty members evaluated
    the appellants’ applications.  The Internal Committee concluded the appellants
    met the requisite academic criteria and recommended admission to the Dean.  The
    applications were then reviewed by the M.Sc. Oversight Committee.  The Oversight
    Committee declined to recommend the appellants for acceptance, based on the
    Department’s recently enacted funding policy respecting graduate students.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a letter dated September 18, 2006, the Oversight Committee notified Dr. Persinger
    to that effect, explaining the policy and their decision in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Oversight Committee noted that the requirements
    of the Departmental policy on funding M.Sc. students were not met.  The regulations
    of the Department of Biology stipulate that each student without a scholarship
    is to receive a Teaching Assistantship, a summer supplement in the first
    year, and contributions from research grants held by the supervisor in the
    amount of $6000.00 in the first year and $8000.00 in the second year.  This
    regulation came into effect January 1, 2006 and is designed to have each
    of our students treated equally and fairly and to comply with an expectation
    of the Ontario Council of Graduate Studies.  It is also a policy consistent
    with that of other universities in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Since the departmental regulations were not met,
    the three students cannot be recommended for acceptance in to the Biology
    M.Sc. program.  The students are encouraged to apply again for admission
    in January, 2007, should the required funding become available.</p>

    students without scholarships<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> accepted into the Department of Biology M.Sc.
    program since January 1, 2006, all received a guaranteed minimum of $15,000.00
    per year with $14000.00 over the two years being supplied by research grants
    held by their supervisors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    funding policy referred to in the foregoing letter was put into effect by
    the Department on January 1, 2006.  It was adopted as a result of concerns
    expressed by the Ontario Council on Graduate Studies (“OCGS”), the official
    provincial standards and accreditation body that reviews and evaluates graduate
    academic programs at universities across
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The particular concerns of the OCGS related to “the very high proportion
    of faculty in the Department without … external research funding” and “the
    amount of graduate supervision performed by faculty with no research funding.”  The
    OCGS wanted to see, amongst other things, an increased level of support for
    graduate students from faculty research grants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to these concerns, the University’s Biology Department passed the
    following resolution:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That an annual minimum stipend of $15,000 be provided
    to M.Sc. students from various sources including GTA, Summer Fellowships,
    scholarships, bursary and faculty research grants for a maximum of two years
    as of January 1, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent from the record that the appellants were aware as early as May,
    2006 that the Department interpreted the funding policy to require part of
    the external funding to come from the research grants of the proposed supervising
    professor.  Indeed, they wrote to the Dean of Biology and others in August
    advising that “the availability of research grants” was not a factor in their
    applications, as they had other sources of funding available from family
    support or possible scholarships.  Family support was not acceptable to the
    University, however; the Department’s policy called for the external funding
    to be arms-length in order to avoid the perception and potential reality
    of students “buying their way into the program.”  Nor was Dr. Persinger’s
    suggestion that the policy would be met by “equivalent funding from the laboratory” and “laboratory
    support” acceptable in the absence of assurances that this meant personal
    funding for the student.  Such assurances were not forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appellants were unsuccessful in their application for admission.</p>
  <h3>The Divisional Court</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dismissed the appellants’ application for judicial review.  It
    held that the decision to admit or not to admit an applicant to graduate
    studies was a discretionary decision going to the core function of a university
    including the provision of education, the conduct of research and the evaluation
    of students.  Courts should only interfere with the exercise of such a function “where
    the applicants demonstrate that there has been a flagrant violation of the
    rules of natural justice”: <i>Baxter v. Memorial University of

    the amount of one-third each.  Kiteley J., dissenting, would have awarded
    a total of $7500, payable severally in the amount of $2500 each.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p><b>The Merits</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    behalf of the appellants Mr. Rosenthal raised two primary arguments, each
    based upon the premise that the Department’s funding policy was an “admission
    standard”.  First, he submitted that the University’s interpretation of the
    policy motion as requiring the research funds to come from the supervising
    professor was unreasonable and, indeed, patently unreasonable.  Secondly,
    he argued that as an admission requirement the Department’s motion had to
    be approved by the University Senate.  In the absence of the Senate’s imprimatur,
    the Department had no jurisdiction to act on the policy or at least acted
    unreasonably in doing so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    begin with, we do not accept the characterization of the Department’s motion
    establishing the funding policy as an admission standard.  Admission standards
    for graduate school at Laurentian University are set out in the Academic
    Regulations passed by the University Senate pursuant to the <i>Laurentian
    University of Sudbury Act</i>, S.O. Chap 151 as amended, s. 11.  They include
    such requirements as (a) holding an appropriate bachelor’s degree at the
    Honours Level, or its equivalent and (b) having maintained at least second
    class standing in their bachelor’s degree (a 70% average in all bachelor’s
    degree courses).  The Academic Regulations make it clear that successful
    completion of undergraduate courses does not ensure automatic admission, “nor
    does meeting minimum requirements”.  In addition to the general admission
    requirements for graduate school, applicants to the Biology M.Sc. program
    at Laurentian must file certain required documentation and find a supervisor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    every criterion that <span lang=EN-US>affects the University’s decision to
    refuse admission to an applicant is an admission standard. The school has
    considerable discretion in choosing who among the pool of persons who meet
    the admission standards will be admitted. In exercising that discretion the
    school may take into account matters that it believes will best enable it
    to provide the highest quality program in the interests of the students and
    to enhance the caliber and reputation of the school itself.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      funding policy falls into that category.  It was an internal departmental
      commitment to ensure that students in its program were adequately funded
      and were supervised by professors who were able to attract research funding.
      The department declined to offer the appellants admission, not because
      they failed to meet an admission standard, but because it was unable to
      offer them the academic experience it was committed to offering.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    funding policy is a supplement to the minimum admission requirements.  As
    Dean Colilli states in his affidavit, it is “an administrative policy meant
    to augment and improve upon the minimum requirements that were set by the
    Laurentian University Senate.” The issue, he noted, “is one of fairness in
    resource allocation.  With a finite amount of resources available, [the]
    policy fairly restricts the number of students to the amount of funding that
    is available for students.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    even if the funding policy were considered to be an admission standard, it
    remains an individual department supplement to the minimum requirements set
    down by the University Senate.  The Academic Regulations clearly contemplate
    that individual departments may engraft additional requirements onto those
    minimums.  Accordingly, we do not accept the argument that the motion establishing
    the funding policy required Senate approval and was therefore ineffective
    and an irrelevant factor that the Oversight Committee was not allowed to
    consider.  Moreover, even if the motion were invalid because not approved
    by the Senate, it was still open to the Department to take the substance
    of the policy into account when determining whether or not to admit the appellants
    given the concerns about the M.Sc. Biology program expressed by OCGS.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third – however
    the funding policy is characterized,- the standard of review to be applied
    is whether the University acted reasonably in making the discretionary admission
    decision that it did: <i>Dunsmuir v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i>, 2008 SCC 9.  In this regard, it has long been accepted
    that courts should be reluctant to interfere in the core academic functions
    of universities: see <i>Baxter v. Memorial University of Newfoundland</i>,
    1998 St. J. No. 2430 (unreported); <i>O’Reilly v. Memorial University of
    Newfoundland</i> [1998] N.J. No. 235;
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the decision whether to admit the appellants to the Department of Biology
    M.Sc. Program was a decision going to the core of a university’s functions.  As
    the Divisional Court observed: “The decision to admit or not is discretionary;
    one made daily in an academic environment.”  We are satisfied that the decision
    was made reasonably – particularly given the need for the Department to respond
    to the concerns registered by OCGS regarding its graduate program – and that
    the Divisional Court did not err in affording that decision considerable
    deference, as do we.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we see no lack of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice in the
    way in which the University dealt with the appellants’ applications for admission.  The
    normal steps for admission to graduate studies in the Department of Biology
    were followed.  There was a free flow of communications between Dr. Persinger,
    on behalf of the appellants, and the Committee during the application process
    and the appellants were made aware of the funding policy.  They communicated
    directly with the Committee in effect seeking a waiver of the policy; the
    University indicated that neither parental funding nor laboratory funding
    that did not include personal funding from Dr. Persinger was acceptable.  The
    appellants were afforded an opportunity to provide further clarification.  Following
    the letter of rejection, Dean Collili offered to meet with the appellants,
    but only one of them took advantage of that offer.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court was correct in concluding that there had been no denial
    of natural justice,

    see no basis for interfering with the decision of the majority of the

    Divisional Court with respect to costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    award of costs is discretionary.  It is apparent from the costs endorsement
    that the majority took into account all the relevant considerations respecting
    an award of costs, and applied the appropriate principles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not find the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements unreasonable in the
    circumstances.  Indeed, Mr. Rosenthal candidly acknowledged that, if successful,
    he would have been seeking an award of something in excess of $31,000 in
    fees plus disbursements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the appellants are students does not insulate them from the cost
    consequences of their decision to litigate.  The majority found that they
    were not impecunious, but did mitigate the personal impact by making each
    applicant responsible for only one-third of the award.</p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons we dismiss the appeal from both the dismissal of the

    $15,000 all inclusive.  Each appellant is responsible for payment of one-third
    of that amount.</p>
