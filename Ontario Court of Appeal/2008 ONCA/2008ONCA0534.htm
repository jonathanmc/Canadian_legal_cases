  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal by Robert Lovelace, Paula Sherman and the Ardoch Algonquin First
    Nation (“AAFN”) from the sentences imposed on them by Cunningham A.C.J.S.C.
    for their admitted contempt of court orders made on August 27 and September
    27, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two court orders allowed the respondent, Frontenac Ventures Corporation (“Frontenac”),
    to conduct a campaign of exploratory drilling for uranium on lands the AAFN
    claims is within the traditional territory occupied by its members for centuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lovelace, Paula Sherman, who is co-chief of the AAFN, and other AAFN members
    engaged in a peaceful protest and blockade, which together prevented Frontenac’s
    managers and employees from engaging in any drilling on the land.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    tripartite negotiations among Frontenac, the AAFN and the Government of Ontario
    (“
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario”) failed to resolve the impasse, the motion judge held that the appellants
    were in contempt of two previous court orders.  The appellants admitted their
    contempt of the court orders, but stated that their conduct flowed from their
    adherence to Algonquin law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge sentenced Mr. Lovelace and Chief Sherman to six months in jail
    and imposed substantial fines on them and on the AAFN.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lovelace and the AAFN appeal their sentences.  Chief Sherman appeals the
    only component of her sentence that remains, the fine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    a superficial level, this appeal raises the typical legal issues posed by
    any sentence appeal: did the sentencing judge make an error in principle
    or were the sentences demonstrably unfit?  However, the reality is that this
    narrow focus cannot resolve the appeal.  That is because the conduct of Frontenac,
    and especially the appellants, requires a broader analytical framework, including
    consideration of constitutional, civil, criminal, aboriginal and statute
    law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the hearing, the court indicated that the appeal was allowed,
    Mr. Lovelace was to be released immediately, and the fines imposed on all
    three appellants were stayed pending the release of the court’s reasons.  These
    are our reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h3>(1) <u>The parties and events</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three appellants in this appeal.  The first is the Ardoch Algonquin First
    Nation, a First Nation community located in the Ottawa valley in eastern
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert
    Lovelace is a member of the AAFN.  He is a former chief and currently holds
    the positions of spokesman and chief negotiator.  He is 60 years old and
    the father of seven children, including four minor children for whom he is
    a single parent.  He is employed as a lecturer and aboriginal student counsellor
    at Queen’s University and is a full-time instructor at Fleming College.  He
    has no criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paula
    Sherman is a co-chief of the AAFN.  She is a single mother of two children
    and a grandmother.  She overcame a lifetime of poverty and hardship to obtain
    a Ph. D.  She is currently employed as a Professor of Native Studies at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName

    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    University.  She has no criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac
    is a private uranium exploration company.  It holds a mining lease, multiple
    mining claims, and several agreements with private property owners to conduct
    mineral exploration on lands in
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Frontenac
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    County, about 60 miles north of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston.  Most of the mining claims are on Crown land.   Frontenac’s lease,
    mining claims and agreements are all within an area of land subject to an
    Algonquin land claim (“the subject property”).  The Algonquin land claim
    was accepted for negotiation by the Governments of Canada and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario and negotiations have been ongoing since 1991.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2007, members of the AAFN learned that Frontenac had staked mineral
    claims on the subject property as authorized under Ontario’s <i>Mining Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.14. They also learned from Frontenac’s website that the
    company was planning “an aggressive exploration and development program” in
    order to determine if future uranium exploration and development was warranted.  The
    website further stated that “substantial drilling and engineering studies … indicated
    that there was potential for an open-pit operation on one of these properties.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June 2007, the AAFN, Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation (“Shabot”) and non-aboriginal
    community groups protested against Frontenac’s uranium exploration plans.  The
    protest led to a blockade that prevented Frontenac from gaining access to
    the lands on which it wished to carry out mineral exploration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the stated reasons for the protest was a purported failure on the part
    of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario to consult with the AAFN and the Shabot about Frontenac’s exploration
    plan and the renewal of its mining lease.  The appellants assert that Frontenac
    is not legally entitled to conduct mineral exploration within the subject
    property until the Crown discharges its constitutional duty to consult with
    the affected First Nations about the impact of mining activity on the environment,
    wildlife harvesting and sacred, archaeological, historical and culturally
    significant sites on the property.</p>
  <h3>(2) <u>The litigation</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2007, Frontenac commenced an action against the AAFN and the Shabot
    and their leaders, seeking an injunction and $77 million in compensation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac
    first sought an interim injunction against the AAFN and the Shabot to restrain
    them from interfering with its exploration program.  Frontenac’s motion was
    heard on August 23, 2007.  The appellants filed no evidence and made no submissions
    on this motion.  Instead, counsel for the appellants attended and advised
    the court that they had, respectfully, decided not to participate in the
    injunction proceedings and had written to the Premier of Ontario to propose
    negotiations to end the dispute.  On August 27, 2007, Thomson J. granted
    the order sought by Frontenac.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not abide by Thomson J.’s order.  Frontenac initiated civil
    contempt proceedings in September 2007, which were rescheduled to November
    2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac
    then sought an interlocutory injunction against the AAFN and the Shabot,
    restraining them and anyone associated with them from interfering with, disrupting
    or hindering in any way Frontenac’s legitimate activities on the subject
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac’s
    motion for an interlocutory injunction was heard by Cunningham A.C.J.S.C.
    on September 24 and 25, 2007.  Once again, the AAFN chose not to participate
    in this proceeding.  They did not provide any evidence, including evidence
    related to their reliance on Algonquin law or their reliance on s. 35 of
    the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>, which recognizes existing aboriginal and
    treaty rights.  On September 27, 2007, the motion judge issued the requested
    interlocutory injunction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not abide by Cunningham A.C.J.S.C.’s order.  The blockade
    of the subject land continued.  Frontenac was unable to continue its uranium
    exploration program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac
    brought an urgent motion returnable on October 4, 2007 to have the appellants
    and other alleged contemnors found in contempt of court for not obeying the
    interlocutory injunction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    prompting by Cunningham A.C.J.S.C., and with the assistance of Scott J.,
    on October 5, 2007 the parties agreed to enter into mediation for a twelve-week
    period.  This period corresponded with the preliminary and non-invasive period
    of Frontenac’s exploration schedule.  As a result, the contempt proceedings
    were adjourned.  One of the purposes of the mediation as expressed by Cunningham
    A.C.J.S.C. was to avoid contempt proceedings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[F]irst of all, I’m very much obliged to all counsel
    for taking this matter so seriously, and trying to work out a realistic solution
    to a difficult problem.  And I’m also very much obliged to Mr. Justice Scott,
    for his intervention – which I think has borne some fruit.  And I wish you
    well.  I’m very hopeful that the process that you have agreed to become a
    part of will be successful, and will avoid the necessity of us having to
    re-convene on November 14<sup>th</sup>.  I think, if good will and a real
    serious attempt at resolution is to prevail, then I think these problems
    can be put aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Negotiations
    among Frontenac, the AAFN and
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario proceeded.  However, despite the efforts of the parties, the mediation
    was not successful and the issues in dispute, especially the mineral exploration

  <h3>(3) <u>The contempt proceedings and sentencing hearing</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the failed mediation, Frontenac revived its civil contempt motion in relation
    to alleged non-compliance with the August 27 and September 27 court orders.  The
    motion was heard by Cunningham A.C.J.S.C. on February 12 through 15, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not contest the motion for contempt.  They admitted that they
    had not complied with the two court orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants restricted their evidence and submissions to the issue of sentence.  Mr.
    Lovelace testified on behalf of all of the AAFN defendants.  The essence
    of his testimony was that uranium exploration on the subject lands would
    violate Algonquin law, which imposed a
    “moratorium” on such activity:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. [E]xactly where does the authority, in your
    view, at least as a matter of Algonquin law, lie for this particular expression,
    the moratorium?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. The authority for this particular moratorium
    lies both with the AAFN Algonquin First Nation – Mr. Perry was our representative
    Elder who after hearing consensus within the community and at the Family
    Heads Council – and it also comes from the authority of William Commanda
    who is the principal Elder of all of the Algonquin people, and after he considered
    it, after he talked with the people that are important to him and the Algonquins
    that he feels are – are representative of the Algonquin voice, then he also
    gave his hand to signing that moratorium.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.    .    .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With the voice of William Commanda, all Algonquins
    have the opportunity to heed that law.  All Algonquins can turn to William
    Commanda and say, I respect this Elder, I respect his teachings, I respect
    his learned opinion, and they can either subscribe to that or not.</p>

    his reasons for sentence, the motion judge observed that counsel for the
    appellants agreed that his clients’ contemptuous behaviour came “perilously
    close to criminal contempt.”  McLachlin J. for the majority of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>United Nurses of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Alberta (Attorney General)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901 at 931, explained that
    the distinction between civil and criminal contempt “rests in the concept
    of public defiance that accompanies criminal contempt.”  She illustrated
    the distinction as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A person who simply breaches a court order, for
    example by failing to abide by visiting hours stipulated in a child custody
    order, is viewed as having committed civil contempt.  However, when the element
    of public defiance of the court’s process in a way calculated to lessen societal
    respect for the courts is added to the breach, it becomes criminal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Canadian Judicial Council’s <i>Guidelines on the Use of Contempt Powers</i> (May
    2001) at p. 13, the Council described public disobedience of an injunction
    as “a classic criminal contempt.”  The Council stated at p. 14 that, “In
    many cases arising out of disobedience of an injunction, the application
    for contempt will be brought in the civil proceedings, but the court may
    nevertheless make a finding of criminal contempt.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge in this case did not make a finding of criminal contempt.  The
    choice of appropriate penalty for contempt must recognize an important distinction
    between civil and criminal contempt:  the purpose of a sentence for criminal
    contempt is punishment, whereas the purpose of a sentence for civil contempt
    is coercive or persuasive, designed to enforce the rights of a private party:
    see <i>Poje v. Attorney General (B.C.)</i>, [1953] S.C.R. 516 at 517.  However, I
    would not place significant weight on this differential purpose in reviewing
    the fitness of the sentences imposed by the motion judge for civil contempt.
    As appellants’ counsel acknowledged at the sentencing hearing, the nature
    of the appellants’ conduct in repeatedly disobeying the interim and interlocutory
    injunctions came extremely close to criminal contempt and may potentially
    have justified such a finding by the motion judge.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned above, the motion judge imposed a combination of penalties – six
    months in jail for Mr. Lovelace and Chief Sherman, fines ranging from $10,000
    to $25,000, prospective fines for future disobedience of $2000 per day, and
    striking the appellants’ pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that these are serious, even stiff, penalties.  Incarceration

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    imposing these sentences, the motion judge grounded his reasons in the rule

    with court orders:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Compliance with orders of this court is not optional.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>.  .  .</p>

    this court, the appellants and the interveners made lengthy submissions about
    the nature of the rule of law.  They argued that the rule of law is not fully
    described as respect for court orders.  Their submissions were primarily
    based on Laskin J.A.’s articulation of the rule of law in another recent
    case dealing with an aboriginal occupation of disputed land.  In <i>Henco
    Industries Ltd. v. Haudenosaunee Six Nations Confederacy Council</i> (2006),
    82 O.R. (3d) 721 at paras. 140-42, Laskin J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]o one can deny the importance of the rule of
    law in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The preamble to our Constitution states that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    is founded on principles that recognize the rule of law.  The Supreme Court
    of Canada has said that it is one of our underlying constitutional values.  See <i>Reference
    re Secession of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217; and <i>Reference re Resolution to Amend
    the Constitution</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But the rule of law has many dimensions, or in
    the words of the Supreme Court of Canada is “highly textured.”  See <i>Reference
    re Resolution to Amend the Constitution</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 805.  One dimension
    is certainly that focused on by the motions judge: the court’s exercise of
    its contempt power to vindicate the court’s authority and ultimately to uphold
    the rule of law.  The rule of law requires a justice system that can ensure
    orders of the court are enforced and the process of the court is respected.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Other dimensions of the rule of law, however, have
    a significant role in this dispute.  These other dimensions include respect
    for minority rights, reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interests
    through negotiations, fair procedural safeguards for those subject to criminal
    proceedings, respect for Crown and police discretion, respect for the separation
    of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and respect
    for Crown property rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  I
    fully accept and agree that compliance with court orders is an important,
    but not exclusive, component of the rule of law.  The motion judge in his
    sentencing decision did not address the other dimensions of the rule of law
    referred to in<i> Henco</i>.  However, I do not think that he erred in focusing
    at the sentencing stage of contempt proceedings on the dimension of the rule
    of law that relates to ensuring that orders of the court are enforced.  The
    following passage from McLachlin J.’s reasons in <i>United Nurses of Alberta</i>,
    at p. 931 supports this view:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both civil and criminal contempt of court rest
    on the power of the court to uphold its dignity and process.  The rule of
    law is at the heart of our society; without it there can be neither peace,
    nor order nor good government.  The rule of law is directly dependent on
    the ability of the courts to enforce their process and maintain their dignity
    and respect.  <i>To maintain their process and respect, courts since the
    12th century have exercised the power to punish for contempt of court.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the stage at which the comprehensive and nuanced description of
    the rule of law expressed in <i>Henco</i> must be considered is when a court
    is requested by a private party to grant an injunction and where doing so
    might have an adverse impact on asserted aboriginal and treaty rights affirmed
    in s. 35 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>.  Such cases demand a careful
    and sensitive balancing of many important interests in assessing whether
    to grant the requested injunction and on what terms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, as in <i>Henco</i>, the competing interests include the
    asserted aboriginal rights of the Algonquin First Nations, Frontenac’s private
    interest in pursuing its exploration plan in accordance with valid mining
    claims and agreements, and respect for the Crown property rights of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    how are these interests to be effectively balanced?  The answer has been
    clear for almost 20 years in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada – consultation,
    negotiation, accommodation, and ultimately, reconciliation of aboriginal
    rights and other important, but at times, conflicting interests: see <i>R.
    v. Sparrow</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075; <i>Haida Nation v. British Columbia
    (Minister of Forests)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511; <i>Taku River Tlingit First
    Nation v. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R.
    550; and <i>Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Heritage)</i>,
    [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388.  The honour of the Crown requires that it act as a committed
    participant in the undoubtedly complex process of consultation and reconciliation:  <i>Haida
    Nation</i>, <i>Taku River</i> and <i>Mikisew Cree</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the clear line of Supreme Court jurisprudence, from <i>Sparrow </i>to <i>Mikisew</i>,
    where constitutionally protected aboriginal rights are asserted, injunctions
    sought by private parties to protect their interests should only be granted
    where every effort has been made by the court to encourage consultation,
    negotiation, accommodation and reconciliation among the competing rights
    and interests.  Such is the case even if the affected aboriginal communities
    choose not to fully participate in the injunction proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am quick to point out that in this case, the AAFN did not appeal either the
    interim or the interlocutory injunctions granted by Thomson J. and Cunningham
    A.S.C.J.C.  It is thus not for this court to address the merits of either
    order.  However, I think it is important to give judicial guidance on the
    role to be played by the nuanced rule of law described in <i>Henco</i> when
    courts are asked to grant injunctions, the violation of which will result
    in aboriginal protestors facing civil or criminal contempt proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a requested injunction is intended to create “a protest-free zone” for contentious
    private activity that affects asserted aboriginal or treaty rights, the court
    must be very careful to ensure that, in the context of the dispute before
    it, the Crown has fully and faithfully discharged its duty to consult with
    the affected First Nations: see Julia E. Lawn, “The John Doe Injunction in
    Mass Protest Cases” (1998) 56 U.T. Fac. L. Rev. 101. The court must further
    be satisfied that every effort has been exhausted to obtain a negotiated
    or legislated solution to the dispute before it.  Good faith on both sides
    is required in this process:  <i>Haida Nation</i>, p. 532.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn then to the sole issue on this appeal – the merits of the sentencing
    decision.  In my view, and with great respect to a judge trying conscientiously
    to resolve a difficult, bordering on intractable problem, the sentences he
    imposed are too harsh.  I say this for several reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in his reasons the motion judge focused exclusively on punishment and deterrence,
    both specific and general.  He said nothing about promoting reformation and
    rehabilitation of leaders of a First Nation community.  Both sides of the
    standard analytical framework in sentencing cases needed to be assessed in
    a balanced fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the motion judge failed to refer to the mitigating factors that were present
    in this case.  Importantly, both Mr. Lovelace and Chief Sherman were first
    offenders.  Until the events giving rise to their protest and blockade, they
    had led lives characterized by leadership in their community, including leadership
    in demonstrating respect for Canadian law.  Both candidly conceded their
    contempt.  These significant facts should have been acknowledged and taken
    into account in fashioning an appropriate sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, some account should have been taken of the way in which the protest
    and blockade were conducted.  The appellants’ conduct was peaceful, with
    no violence and no damage to property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there should have been recognition of the limited purpose of the appellants’ conduct.  The
    purpose was not a “no entry” purpose, whereby non-Algonquins could not set
    foot on the disputed property.  Rather, the purpose was to prevent mining
    exploration on lands which were, and still are, subject to land claim negotiations
    with the Governments of Canada and
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of these factors ought to have been considered by the motion judge when fashioning
    appropriate sanctions for their acts of contempt.  Another way of saying
    this is that the sentencing principles articulated by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. Gladue</i> (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385, are applicable
    when fashioning a sentence for civil or criminal contempt on the part of
    aboriginal contemnors.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Gladue</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada was asked to consider the purpose of s. 718.2(e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which requires that a court take into account
    the principle that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that
    are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, <i>with
    particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders</i>” [emphasis
    added]. <i> </i>At para. 50, the court referred to the
    “acute problem of the disproportionate incarceration of aboriginal peoples.”  The
    court accepted that the purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to provide sentencing judges
    with the flexibility and authority to
    “resort to the restorative model of justice in sentencing aboriginal offenders
    and to reduce the imposition of jail sentences where to do so would not sacrifice
    the traditional goals of sentencing” (para. 50).  According to the court,
    sentencing judges must pay particular attention to the unique circumstances
    of aboriginal offenders, namely:  “[t]he unique systemic or background factors
    which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender
    before the courts” and “[t]he types of sentencing procedures and sanctions
    which may be appropriate in the circumstances of the offender because of
    his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection” (para. 66).  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Frontenac
    and Ontario contend that the <i>Gladue</i> principles should not be extended
    beyond the criminal context because criminal law sentencing is designed to
    achieve entirely different objectives from sentencing for contempt. I do
    not agree with this submission.  The <i>Gladue</i> principles have already
    been extended to a variety of other contexts in the criminal justice system,
    including bail, parole eligibility, dangerous offender applications, and
    disposition hearings of the Ontario Review Board.  In this last context,
    in <i>R. v. Sim</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 183 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Sharpe J.A. said, at para. 16: “I do not think that the principles underlying <i>Gladue</i> should
    be limited to the sentencing process and I can see no reason to disregard
    the <i>Gladue</i> principles when assessing the criminal justice system’s
    treatment of NCR accused.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although <i>Gladue</i> was
    focused primarily on the serious problem of excessive imprisonment of aboriginal
    peoples, the case in a broader sense draws attention to the state of the
    justice system’s engagement with Canada’s First Nations.  I note three factors
    in particular that were highlighted in <i>Gladue:</i> the estrangement of
    aboriginal peoples from the Canadian justice system, the impact of years
    of dislocation, and whether imprisonment would be meaningful to the community
    of which the offender is a member.  Those factors were all at stake in this
    case.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    while the appellants did not contest the injunctions and admitted that they
    were in breach of the orders, the enforcement of the injunctions by imprisonment
    could not help but emphasize the estrangement of this community and aboriginal
    peoples generally from the justice system.  The use of incarceration as the
    first response to breach of the injunction dramatically marginalizes the
    significance of aboriginal law and aboriginal rights.  Second, imposing a
    lengthy term of imprisonment on a first offender fails to recognize the impact
    of years of dislocation.  The fact that persons of the stature of Mr. Lovelace
    and Chief Sherman saw no meaningful avenues of redress within the justice
    system and felt driven to take these drastic measures demonstrates the impact
    of years of dislocation and the other problems discussed in <i>Gladue</i> at
    paras. 67-69.  Finally, imprisonment, far from being a meaningful sanction
    for the community, had the effect of pitting the community against the justice
    system.  That the court found it necessary to imprison the leaders of the
    AAFN simply serves to emphasize the gulf between the dominant culture’s sense
    of justice and this First Nation’s sense of justice.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I cannot agree that the principles underlying the <i>Gladue</i> decision
    have no application in the civil contempt context.  Rather, as in <i>Gladue</i>,
    the court must look at the unique systemic or background factors at play
    in this case.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    then are the unique systemic or background factors that played a part in
    bringing the AAFN and two of its leaders before the courts to be sentenced
    for contempt? The first background factor is that there <i>is</i> an existing
    land claim negotiation between the Algonquin Nation and Ontario.  In <i>Haida
    Nation</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held at pp. 532-36 that when the
    Crown has knowledge that a First Nation community has claimed rights or title
    in respect of a territory, it must consult the affected community and, where
    indicated, must accommodate aboriginal concerns before approving any activity
    that could have an impact on the claimed rights or title.  In <i>Taku River</i>,
    at p. 567, the Supreme Court also held that the fact that a land claim has
    been accepted by the Crown for negotiation establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case
    that the claim has merit.  Ontario accepted the Algonquin land claim for
    negotiation in 1991: see <i>Frontenac Ventures Corp. v. Ardoch Algonquin
    First Nation</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 3360 (S.C.J.) at para. 25.  <i>Haida Nation</i> and <i>Taku
    River</i> together instruct that the existing, and as yet unresolved, Algonquin
    land claim – the basis for the AAFN’s protest and blockade – cannot simply
    be dismissed as illusory, flawed or weak.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second background factor that played a part in bringing the appellants before
    the courts is the nature and content of Ontario’s <i>Mining Act</i>.  It
    is a remarkably sweeping law.  It establishes a “free entry” system whereby
    all Crown lands, including those subject to aboriginal land claims, are open
    for prospecting and staking, without any consultation or permitting required.  Anyone
    with a prospector’s licence may stake claims and prospect for minerals on
    any Crown land.  Once a claim has been staked, in accordance with the Act,
    the Mining Recorder must record the claim.  There is nothing in the <i>Mining
    Act</i> about considering aboriginal land claims or interests.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    intersection of these two background circumstances creates an obvious problem,
    indeed the problem that lies at the heart of this case.  What Frontenac wants
    to do on Crown land – staking and exploration – is legal under the <i>Mining
    Act</i>.  However, the appellants’ response, although in contempt of two
    court orders, is grounded, at a minimum, in a respectable interpretation
    of s. 35 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i> and several recent decisions
    of the Supreme Court of Canada.  In summary, the appellants’ character and
    circumstances, their actual conduct, and the difficult legal context within
    which it occurred, should have counted as significant mitigation when sentences
    were imposed on them.  The circumstances of the offences and these aboriginal
    offenders are such that, in accordance with the <i>Gladue</i> principles,
    sentences of incarceration were  inappropriate.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third reason for concluding that the sentences imposed on the appellants
    were too harsh is that they are considerably more severe than the sentences
    imposed in other protest/blockade cases.  In <i>MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v.
    Brown</i> (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 148, the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    allowed in part appeals from sentences for criminal contempt consisting of
    public disobedience of court orders related to logging operations in Clayoquot
    Sound.  McEachern C.J.B.C., for the majority, discussed past sentences that
    were imposed by B.C. courts for contempt in non-violent protest cases, at
    para. 8:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In most cases the courts have endeavoured to deal
    firmly, but leniently with those found guilty of contempt… In the more recent
    disputes, although short, unsuspended terms of imprisonment were imposed
    in some of the [abortion clinic protest cases (e.g., <i>Everywoman’s Health
    Centre Society v. Bridges</i> (1990), 54 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273 and <i>R. v. Bridges
    (No. 2)</i> (1989), 61 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 154)], sentences have been
    nominal fines or suspended terms of imprisonment and probation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In <i>MacMillan Bloedel</i>,
    the majority reduced the sentences of those who had pleaded guilty from 45
    days to 30 days imprisonment (one appellant received a suspended sentence)
    and upheld the sentences of 45 days for offenders who had not pleaded guilty.  The
    majority set aside fines of up to $1500 imposed against each of the appellants
    because there had been no inquiry into their ability to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    further illustration of the tendency of courts to impose nominal fines or
    short terms of imprisonment in blockade/protest cases is the recent decision
    of <i>Peter Kiewet Sons Co. v. Perry</i>, 2007 BCSC 305.  Sixteen individuals
    were arrested for breaching a court-ordered injunction that restrained protestors
    from obstructing work crews in building a highway.  Seven of the defendants
    were found guilty of criminal contempt.  One of these defendants, who did
    not admit her contempt, was sentenced to 14 days imprisonment, while the
    other six were sentenced to a fine of $5000 or 250 hours of community service.  The
    remaining defendants, who acknowledged their contempt but who “did not engage
    in open flagrant and continuous violation of the court order” were sentenced
    to a $250 fine or 24 hours of community service (with one exception of a
    $500 fine or 50 hours of community service for a second-time offender: see
    para. 28).  Against the backdrop of these and many other similar cases, custodial
    sentences of six months and fines of $10,000 to $25,000 for first time offenders
    are very high indeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    I observe that, by the time of the sentencing hearing on February 15, 2008,
    the Shabot contemnors and Chief Perry of the AAFN had purged their contempt
    by undertaking not to continue their protest and blockade activities.  Only
    Mr. Lovelace and Chief Sherman remained.  It appeared that a process initiated
    with care, sensitivity and fairness by the motion judge in the autumn of
    2007 was bearing fruit.  In my view, continued adherence to the conciliatory
    values that drove that autumn process suggested a more moderate sentence
    for the only two contemnors still not complying with the earlier court orders.  On
    February 15, 2008, in light of the progress already made, much of it with
    the encouragement and assistance of the motion judge, there was no need to
    bring down the hammer of long jail sentences and very substantial fines.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the custodial and monetary components of the
    sentences imposed on the appellants were too harsh.  Accordingly, I would
    allow the appeal and set aside both components of the sentences, including
    the prospective fines for future disobedience. In my view, in Mr. Lovelace’s
    case, a fine of $1000 would have been appropriate.  However, having regard
    to the time he has spent in custody, I refrain from imposing any penalty
    on him.   I would not fine Chief Sherman or the community who have no ability
    to pay the fines.  I would leave intact the pleadings component of the sentencing
    decision, with which the appellants do not take issue.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor,
    at this juncture, would I order any custodial sentence.  That is not to say
    that incarceration is always out of place in civil contempt cases.  In some
    cases, including potentially this case down the road, incarceration and substantial
    fines may be necessary.  However, it would be wrong to cross this bridge
    now for these first offenders in a situation that cries out for dedicated
    negotiation among Ontario, the AAFN and Frontenac with a view to reconciliation
    of the competing interests.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this final point I could cite almost 20 years of Supreme Court of Canada
    decisions, from <i>Sparrow </i>to <i>Mikisew</i>, or the eloquent <i>Report
    of the Ipperwash Inquiry</i> (Queen’s Printer for Ontario, 2007).  However,
    I choose to quote the equally thoughtful observation by the motion judge
    near the end of his reasons in support of the interlocutory injunction he
    issued on September 27, 2007:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I fully recognize that this case engages complex
    relations between the Crown and aboriginal peoples.  I also recognize that
    respect for consultation lies at the heart of resolving such disputes even
    when certainty over the legitimacy and extent of the claim is unresolved.  As
    the Supreme Court of Canada has noted in <i>Mikisew Cree First Nation v.
    Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage)</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388 and in <i>Haida</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    conciliation between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples, and their respective
    claims, interests and ambitions is the fundamental objective of these negotiations.</p>
