  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Aviva Insurance Company of Canada appeals from the judgment of
    Allen J. dated 29 October 2007 declaring that Aviva has a duty to defend
    Pizza Pizza Limited under its Commercial General Liability Policy with respect
    to some aspects of an action brought against Pizza Pizza by a pedestrian
    seriously injured when she was struck by a Pizza Pizza delivery vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff in the underlying action, Ursula Prince, alleges that Pizza Pizza’s
    negligence encompasses (1) its business practice of providing food free if
    delivered more than 30 minutes after it is ordered (this allegedly encourages
    its drivers to drive fast since they risk paying late fees themselves), (2)
    its failure to have safe driving policies in place, and (3) its failure to
    test or investigate the driving history of the driver who caused the collision
    for his propensity for speed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurance policy on which Pizza Pizza relies contains this exclusion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Exclusions</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e.1) ‘Bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ arising
    out of the ownership, use or operation by or on behalf of any insured of:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a) Any ‘automobile’</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the exclusion did not catch the ‘non-automobile’ claims
    asserted against Pizza Pizza and that Aviva had a duty to defend those claims.  She
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the facts before me, I accept Pizza Pizza’s
    view there is a non-automobile related concurrent claim in relation to injury
    caused by Pizza Pizza’s corporate policy.  While it is the case that the
    Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the driver’s negligent driving, I find
    the pleadings do give rise to the possibility that the Plaintiff’s injuries
    were caused by Pizza Pizza’s delivery policy and failure to screen drivers’ driving
    records.  I find that the claim is independent of the claim that involves
    the use or operation of an automobile, and for that reason, falls outside
    the scope of the exclusion in Aviva’s CGL policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that this conclusion is in error.  It submits that the
    alleged
    ‘non-automobile’ components of Pizza Pizza’s negligence in the underlying
    action are in fact derivative of the essential core or substance of the plaintiff’s
    claim – she was injured as a result of the negligent operation of a motor
    vehicle driven “on behalf of” Pizza Pizza.  The fact that the motor vehicle
    was driven “on behalf of” Pizza Pizza is confirmed by paragraph 11 of the
    statement of claim which reads: “The Plaintiff says that the Defendant employed
    Kadir or contracted his services.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with this submission.  The proper basis for determining whether a duty
    to defend exists in any given situation requires an assessment of the pleadings
    to ascertain the substance and true nature of the claims: see <i>Monenco
    v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 699 at para. 35.  Similarly,
    in <i>Non-marine Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London v. Scalera</i>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 551 at para. 50, the court stated that in a duty to defend analysis, “a
    court must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of
    the allegations contained in the pleadings.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    this test, in our view the alleged ‘non-automobile’
    claims in the underlying action are in fact caught by the exclusion in Aviva’s
    policy.  The precipitating and most important cause of the plaintiff’s injuries
    was the delivery driver’s alleged negligence, not the negligence of Pizza
    Pizza in its corporate policies.  The “30 minutes or free” policy exists
    and is not actionable by the world at large unless there is negligent driving
    by a delivery driver causing personal injury or property damage.  In other
    words, the alleged non-automobile claims are derived from, not independent
    of, the automobile claim.  As expressed by Doherty J.A. in a case very similar
    to this appeal, <i>Unger v. Unger</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 257 at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The mere description of some of the acts of negligence
    as ‘negligent business practices’ does not create a separate and discrete
    cause of action.  Those allegations could assist the Ungers in establishing
    their claim only to the extent that they helped them demonstrate that the
    vehicle was being used or operated in a negligent fashion when the accident
    in which the Ungers were injured occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed.  The appellant is entitled to its costs of the application
    and the appeal on a partial indemnity scale which we fix at $5000 and $7500
    respectively, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
