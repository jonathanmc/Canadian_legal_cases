    appellant appeals the decision of McIsaac J. that dismissed a motion to set
    aside a default judgment.  The motion judge found 1) that the statement of
    claim was served in accordance with the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    2) that the respondent granted an indulgence to the appellant by communicating
    with its historical solicitor regarding the pending default proceedings (and
    whose law clerk acknowledged that the lawyer would advise if he was not retained
    on the matter), and 3) that the appellant made a tactical decision not to
    defend the action because of perceived deficiencies in the service of statement
    of claim. McIsaac J. further found that the appellant’s affidavit did not
    raise an arguable defence on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judge applied the correct test and made no reversible
    error in his application of the test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant failed to meet the requirements of Rule 16.07(a) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> in moving to set aside the default judgment. The appellant’s
    affidavit material does not give any explanation for his failure to defend
    the action after he had been served with the statement of claim in accordance
    with the Rules, and after his lawyer had received the statement of claim
    and had been put on notice that the respondent intended to take default proceedings.  This
    failure supports the adverse inference drawn by the motion judge that the
    appellant made a tactical decision not to respond to the action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the potential merit of the defence, the action was brought by
    the respondent as mortgagor on the basis that the appellant’s conduct as
    mortgagee in possession deprived the respondent of the ability to make payments
    on the mortgage by interfering with a financially beneficial tenancy and
    causing the property to deteriorate. The respondent claimed that the effect
    of the appellant’s actions was that nothing further was owed on the mortgages.  The
    appellant did not respond to these allegations but stated baldly that a significant
    amount remained outstanding on the mortgages.  The motion judge therefore
    made no error in concluding that there appeared to be no arguable defence
    on the merits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises deficiencies in the statement of claim that he says did
    not entitle the respondent to a judgment for possession of the property and
    discharge of the mortgages.  However, upon default, the appellant is deemed
    to admit the allegations in the statement of claim including that the mortgage
    contracts have been performed and that the appellant has no further right
    of possession.  In his affidavit sworn for the purpose of responding to the
    motion, the respondent sets out an accounting of the amounts owing on the
    mortgages and the amounts that the respondent claims from the appellant for
    damages in respect of the appellant’s actions with respect to the property
    that offset the amounts owing.  This accounting demonstrates that the respondent’s
    claim, which is deemed to be true by the default, is a justifiable one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had also argued that the respondent’s amendment of its statement
    of claim after the default judgment in order to correct the description of
    the property, allowed the appellant a new opportunity to defend.  The motion
    judge rejected the argument because no new relief was requested.  We see
    no error in this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed at $20,000 for both the appeal
    and the motion before Watt J.A., inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
