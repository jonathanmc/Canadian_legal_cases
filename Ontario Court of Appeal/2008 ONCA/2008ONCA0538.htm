    appellant, Adolfo A. Flora, was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1999.  After
    consulting several
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario doctors, he was told that he was not a suitable candidate for a liver
    transplant and was given approximately six to eight months to live.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Flora explored his overseas treatment options.  Eventually, at a cost of
    about $450,000, he underwent chemoembolization to contain the growth and
    decrease the size of his existing tumours and a living-related liver transplantation
    (LRLT), a procedure involving the transfer of part of a living donor’s liver
    to the patient, at a hospital in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    .  Fortunately, these procedures saved Mr. Flora’s life.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Flora applied to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) for reimbursement
    of his medical expenses.  When his reimbursement request was rejected by
    the respondent, the General Manager of OHIP, Mr. Flora sought a review of
    OHIP’s decision before the Health Services Appeal and Review Board.  The
    majority of the Board upheld OHIP’s denial of reimbursement on the basis
    that the treatment received by Mr. Flora in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    was not an “insured service” within the meaning of the <i>Health Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.6 (the Act) and s. 28.4(2) of R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    552 (the Regulation).  Mr. Flora’s subsequent appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    Divisional Court was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    Flora now appeals to this court.  He argues that the Divisional Court erred:
    (i) by applying the reasonableness standard of review to the Board’s decision;
    (ii) by concluding that the Board’s decision was reasonable; and (iii) in
    the alternative, by failing to declare that s.&nbsp;28.4(2) of the Regulation
    violates his rights to life and security of the person under s. 7 of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early 1970s, Mr. Flora contracted Hepatitis C from tainted blood in a
    blood transfusion carried out during surgery to remove a benign tumour from
    his esophagus.  Eventually, this led to cirrhosis of the liver and, despite
    regular monitoring, a diagnosis of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma
    or “HCC”) in 1999.  Mr. Flora was then 50 years old.  His cancer was advanced
    and multifocal – he had several tumours or lesions.  His prognosis was dire – he
    was told by
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario doctors that he had about six to eight months to live.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Mr. Flora’s liver cancer was detected, only cadaveric liver transplants were
    performed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  LRLTs were relatively new and adult-to-adult LRLT programs were
    in their infancy both in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Europe.  As a result, an adult-to-adult LRLT had not yet been undertaken
    in this province, although paediatric LRLTs had been performed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    that time, adult patient eligibility for cadaveric liver transplants was
    determined by physicians in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario based on medically-established guidelines developed in the mid-1990s,
    known as the “Milan Criteria”.  Under these criteria as employed in Ontario,
    doctors would only undertake a liver transplant if: (i) the patient had one
    tumour equal to or less than five centimetres in diameter; (ii) alternatively,
    in the case of multiple tumours, no more than three tumours existed, each
    equal to or less than three centimetres in diameter; and (iii) there was
    no evidence of vascular invasion or spread of the cancer outside the liver.  These
    restrictions recognized
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s chronic shortages of transplant organs relative to need, and the
    goal of ensuring that transplant candidates with high survival prospects
    were approved for transplants in priority to patients with lower chances
    of good survival outcomes. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imaging
    studies conducted on Mr. Flora in Ontario in December 1999 and in England
    in February 2000 revealed that he had multiple tumours, some of which were
    quite large and in excess of the Milan Criteria as applied in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Faced
    with his alarming diagnosis and prognosis, Mr. Flora examined the possibility
    of a liver transplant with Dr. Florence Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology
    and hepatology at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Toronto General
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital (the TGH).  Dr. Wong, in turn, explored Mr. Flora’s treatment options
    with several other
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario specialists, including the Medical Director of the Liver Transplant
    Unit at the TGH.  This unit assessed Mr. Flora and concluded that he was
    ineligible for a cadaveric liver transplant under the Milan Criteria.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result, with Dr. Wong’s assistance, Mr. Flora consulted a number of experts
    overseas, including Dr. M.P. Manns, Director of the Department of Gastroenterology
    and Hepatology at the
    <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">
    Hanover
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  Based on an assessment of Mr. Flora conducted in early February 2000,
    Dr. Manns reported that Mr. Flora’s cancer was
    “amenable neither to resection [surgical removal] nor to liver transplantation
    due to its multifocal nature”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    the same month, Mr. Flora also met with Dr. Roger Williams, a hepatologist
    and Head of the Liver Unit at the Cromwell Hospital in London, England (the
    Cromwell), and Dr. Shamsudin Mohamed Rela, a transplant surgeon, of the same
    hospital (Mr. Flora’s
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.K.</st1:country-region>
    doctors).  The Cromwell operates on private funding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Cromwell’s LRLT program had been initiated only some months earlier, in the
    fall of 1999, to assist overseas patients who had no priority in cadaver
    donor organ allocation under
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    ’s national health care system.  In its program, the Cromwell used cadaveric
    transplant eligibility criteria to determine patient-eligibility for a LRLT.  However,
    these criteria were broader than
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s Milan Criteria: the Cromwell offered liver transplantation if the
    prospective patient had three tumours or less, with a maximum diameter of
    5 centimetres.  As well, the Cromwell’s approach to these criteria was flexible.  For
    example, lesions of only a few millimetres in size were accorded little,
    if any, significance in transplant assessments at the Cromwell.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Flora underwent immediate chemoembolization at the Cromwell and was found
    to be eligible for a liver transplant under that hospital’s cadaveric transplant
    selection criteria.  Because of the extensive wait lists in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    for cadaveric organs, particularly for non-residents, Mr. Flora was approved
    as a candidate for a LRLT.  He was regarded at the Cromwell as an “acceptable”,
    but not the “best”, candidate for this procedure.  Mr. Flora’s brother agreed
    to serve as the living donor.</p>

    and consulted Dr. William Wall, the Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant
    Program at the London Health Sciences Centre in

    liver transplantation would not be recommended for a patient who had more
    than three tumours due to the high risk of cancer recurrence.  Dr. Wall also

    issue before the Board was whether the treatment received by Mr. Flora at
    the Cromwell was an “insured service” under s. 28.4(2) of the Regulation
    and, therefore, under the Act.  The parties agreed that the treatment in
    question consisted of both Mr. Flora’s chemoembolization procedure and his
    LRLT.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant
    to s. 12(1) of the Act, an insured person is entitled to receive payment
    from OHIP for “insured services” in such amounts and subject to such conditions
    and co-payments, if any, as are prescribed.  Section 28.4(2) of the Regulation
    establishes a two-part test for the determination of whether an out-of-country
    medical treatment constitutes an “insured service”.  Under the first branch
    of the test, the treatment in question must be “generally accepted in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario as appropriate for a person in the same medical circumstances as
    the [reimbursement claimant]” (s. 28.4(2)(a)).  The second branch of the
    test requires that the treatment be one that is not performed in Ontario
    by an identical or equivalent procedure or, if performed in Ontario, that
    it is necessary for the claimant to travel out of Canada to avoid a delay “that
    would result in death or medically significant irreversible tissue damage” (s.
    28.4(2)(b)). </p>

    satisfied in Mr. Flora’s case, the first branch – s. 28.4(2)(a) – was not
    because his medical treatment in England was not “generally accepted in Ontario
    as appropriate for a person in [his] medical circumstances”.  Accordingly,
    Mr. Flora had not satisfied the test under s. 28.4(2) of the Regulation for
    an “insured service” and no reimbursement of his medical expenses at the
    Cromwell was available under s. 12(1) of the Act.  The Board, therefore,

    Flora argues that the issue before the Board was “a pure question of law” concerning
    the meaning of the phrase “generally accepted in

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as appropriate” under s. 28.4(2)(a) of the Regulation.  He submits

    Divisional Court, an evaluation of the four factors comprising the pragmatic
    and functional approach to judicial review was required to determine the
    proper level of deference owed to the Board’s decision.  See for example, <i>Pushpanathan

    <st1:country-region

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court undertook this analysis and concluded that, overall, the

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i>, 2008 SCC 9.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> now governs the standard
    of review analysis applicable to administrative decisions.  Under <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    the reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> and patent unreasonableness standards
    of review have been collapsed into a single standard of reasonableness.  However,
    I do not understand <i>Dunsmuir</i> to have entirely jettisoned the factors
    relevant under the pragmatic and functional analysis.  To the contrary, <i>Dunsmuir</i> confirms
    that the factors considered by the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court continue to be relevant to the determination of the appropriate
    standard of review applicable to the decision of an administrative tribunal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority of the Supreme Court in <i>Dunsmuir</i> explained the standard of
    review analysis in these terms (at para. 62):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In summary, the process of judicial review involves
    two steps.  First, courts ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already
    determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded
    with regard to a particular category of question.  Second, where the first
    inquiry proves unfruitful, courts must proceed to an analysis of the factors
    making it possible to identify the proper standard of review. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;'>As the majority in <i>Dunsmuir</i> indicated
    at para. 64, the “factors” referenced in this passage include those that
    applied under the pragmatic and functional approach.  </p>

    my view, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court properly applied these factors in this case.  The
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court accepted that two factors support the application of the
    least deferential standard of review – correctness.  First, the legislature
    did not enact a privative clause to insulate the Board’s decision from judicial
    review.  Instead, s. 24(1) of the Act affords a broad right of appeal to
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  I agree with the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that this factor suggests that less deference is to be afforded
    to the Board on judicial review.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at para. 52.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Board’s task was to determine whether the medical treatment received by Mr.
    Flora in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    constituted an “insured service” within the meaning of the Act and s. 28.4(2)
    of the Regulation.  This determination did not require the Board to engage
    in an evaluation of broad policy-laden choices that involved “the balancing
    of multiple sets of interests of competing constituencies”: see <i>Monsanto</i> at
    para. 15.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court concluded that this factor also suggests less deference
    to the Board’s decision.  Again, I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    said, <i>Dunsmuir</i> reiterates that deference is owed by reviewing courts
    where – as here – the challenged tribunal decision involves a question in
    which the legal and factual issues are interwoven and cannot be readily separated.  The
    question at issue before the Board was fact-driven and case specific.  As
    the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court observed, the express language of s. 28.4(2)(a) links the
    funding test to Mr. Flora’s medical circumstances.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> recognizes
    that the requirement for this type of fact-driven inquiry is a strong indicator
    for the application of the reasonableness standard of review (at paras. 51
    and 53).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relative expertise of the Board also militates in favour of the reasonableness
    standard.  The Divisional Court properly emphasized that the Board was required “to
    consider the specifics of Mr. Flora’s case, clinical considerations, and
    professional and ethical standards” and that this analysis involved “an understanding
    of medicine, an area where the courts cannot claim to have greater expertise
    than the Board members …”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    in reaching its decision, the Board was engaged in interpreting the Act and
    s. 28.4(2) of the Regulation, in respect of which it must be taken as having
    considerable familiarity.  The review of OHIP reimbursement decisions concerning
    out-of-country medical services is a common undertaking of the Board.  The
    Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly held, and <i>Dunsmuir</i> confirms,
    that even in respect of a pure question of law, the decision of an expert
    tribunal regarding the interpretation and application of its ‘home’ statute,
    or of statutes closely connected to its function, with which the tribunal
    will have particular familiarity, may attract deference (at paras. 54-56). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretation and application of s. 28.4(2) was a matter well within the
    domain of the Board’s experience.  To use the language of the majority in <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    the Board’s inquiry did not involve an issue of general law “that is both
    of central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside [its] specialized
    area of expertise” so as to attract the correctness standard of review.  <i>Dunsmuir</i> at
    para. 60.  Nor does Mr. Flora’s <i>Charter</i> s. 7 challenge convert the
    nature of the question at issue before the Board into one of broad legal
    complexity and significance.  Section 6(3) of the <i>Ministry of Health Appeal
    and Review Boards Act, 1998</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 18, Sch. H, precludes the
    Board from undertaking <i>Charter</i>-based inquiries.  Mr. Flora’s <i>Charter</i> s.
    7 challenge, therefore, was first addressed by the

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the Board’s expertise in medical matters and in respect of a legislative

    analysis that render the Board’s decision both unreasonable and incorrect.  He
    submits that the Board erred: (i) by relying on the evidence of cadaveric

    begin with consideration of the meaning of ‘reasonableness’.  In <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada explained this standard in the
    judicial review context in these terms (at para. 47):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[C]ertain questions that come before administrative
    tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.  Instead,
    they may give rise to a number of possible, reason-able conclusions.  Tribunals
    have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational
    solutions. … In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with
    the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process.  But it is also concerned with whether the decision
    falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible
    in respect of the facts and law.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;'>It is against this standard that

    a factor irrelevant to patient selection for a LRLT.  However, read in their

    of cadaveric organ supply was relevant to the purposes behind the original
    development of the Milan Criteria, that selection criteria specific to LRLT
    patient candidacy had not been developed in Europe or Canada, and that the ‘supply

    of a liver transplant – cadaveric or otherwise – for Mr. Flora.  She referred
    Mr. Flora to Dr. Les Lilly at the TGH for that purpose and the TGH Liver
    Transplant Unit evaluated Mr. Flora’s suitability for a cadaveric liver transplant.  Dr.
    Wall, at the LHSC, assessed Mr. Flora’s eligibility for both a cadaveric

    medical treatment for a particular patient is “not purely a medical concept”.  To
    the contrary, “[A] physician’s determination about whether treatment is appropriate
    includes not only medical facts like the projected chance of success but
    also ethical considerations.”  Thus, with LRLTs, “[T]he potential risk to
    the donor, in relation to the benefit to the recipient, play[s] a significant
    role in the decision whether to offer a transplant.”  In their evidence before

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.K.</st1:country-region>
    doctors and Dr. Wall also confirmed that ethical considerations form an essential

    the medical efficacy approach to the interpretation of “appropriateness” is
    inconsistent with the plain language of s. 28.4(2)(a).  If the interpretation
    of
    “appro-priateness” advanced by Mr. Flora were to govern, any potentially
    life-saving out-of-country medical treatment would qualify for public funding
    under the Act, regardless of a patient’s particular medical circumstances,
    simply because it would be of potential benefit to the patient.  This would
    ignore the requirement under s. 28.4(2)(a) that the “appropriateness” of
    a treatment be determined with reference to a person “in the same medical
    circumstances” as the reimbursement claimant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    28.4(2) of the Regulation embodies a clear conceptual distinction between
    the “appropriateness” and the “availability”
    of a medical treatment.  Section 28.4(2)(a) is concerned with the former,
    while s. 28.4(2)(b) focuses on the latter.  On the plain language of s. 28.4(2),
    the legislature has indicated that a treatment may be generally accepted
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as appropriate (s. 28.4(2)(a)), although it is not performed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Ontario (s. 28.4(2)(b)).  In accordance with well-established principles
    of statutory interpretation, meaning must be accorded to each branch of the
    s. 28.4(2) funding test.  There is nothing in s. 28.4(2)(a) to suggest that
    the “appropriateness” of a medical treatment is to be determined exclusively
    on the basis of its potential medical efficacy.</p>

    the interpretation of “appropriateness”
    posited by Mr. Flora is also incon-sistent with the legislative purpose of
    s. 28.4(2).  I agree with the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that the purpose of s. 28.4(2) is to allow

    abroad that they are entitled to receive in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario”.  If the medical efficacy interpretation of
    “appropriateness” was accepted, it would mean that Ontario residents would
    be entitled to bypass the requirements of s. 28.4(2)(a) and receive publicly-funded
    medical treatments that are offered solely on the basis of foreign medical
    assessments concerning the potential benefit of the treatments at issue.  This,
    too, would ‘read-out’
    the requirement in s. 28.4(2)(a) that the appropriateness of a medical treatment
    be determined with reference to general medical practices and standards “in
    Ontario” and the claimant’s own medical circumstances.</p>

    the interpretation urged by Mr. Flora reflects an overly broad approach to

    example, <i>Auton (Guardian Ad Litem of) v.

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To deny an Ontarian coverage for a life-saving operation

    features of this legislative regime must be emphasized.  The funding provided

    those medical services that the legislature has determined should be included

    legislative regime is a funding scheme.  The Act specifies only those health
    services that will be financed – in whole or in part – from public funds.  The
    Regulation, in turn, sets out those services that are covered under the funding
    scheme.  It remains the task of health care professionals to determine the
    nature of the medical services to be provided to a particular patient.</p>

    this context, s. 28.4(2)(a) of the Regulation entitles residents of Ontario

    s. 28.4(2)(a) contains an important limitation on access to public funds

    is “generally accepted in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario as appropriate for a person in the same medical circumstances [as

    is simply nothing in the Act or s. 28.4(2) of the Regulation to suggest that
    the funding criteria established by s. 28.4(2) are different in kind, or
    are to be applied any differently, where the appropriateness of the treatment
    in question is supported by international rather than local medical opinion,
    or where the nature of the treatment is potentially life-saving.  To import

    end my analysis of the reasonableness of the Board’s decision where I began.  Under
    the formulation of the reasonableness standard articulated in <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    deference is owed to the Board’s decision if it falls within a range of acceptable
    outcomes that are defensible on the facts and the law and if the justification
    for the decision is sound, transparent and intelligible.  I have no hesitation
    in concluding that the Board’s decision satisfies these requirements.  I

    offends s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He argues that: (i) the denial of his
    OHIP Application deprived him of access to a life-saving medical treatment,
    thereby violating his s. 7 rights to life and security of the person; (ii)
    the state also deprived him of his s. 7 rights by amending, in 1992, a predecessor
    version of the Regulation that would have provided funding for his LRLT on
    the basis of medical necessity; (iii) in any event, s. 7 imposes a positive
    obligation on the state to provide life-saving medical treatments, thus obviating
    the need for a finding of state action amounting to deprivation; and (iv)
    finally, s. 28.4(2) does not comport with the principles of fundamental justice.  For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that Mr. Flora’s <i>Charter</i> s. 7

    seems to me that the decision of this count in <i>Ferrel v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 97 is a full answer to
    this claim.  In <i>Ferrel</i>, Morden A.C.J.O., writing for the court, confirmed
    that a <i>Charter</i> violation cannot be grounded on a mere change in the
    law.  He said (at p. 110): “If there is no constitutional obligation to enact
    [the legislation at issue] in the first place, I think that it is implicit,
    as far as the requirements of the constitution are concerned, that the legislature
    is free to return the state of the statute book to what it was before [the
    impugned legislation].”  Subsequently, in <i>Lalonde v. Ontario</i> (2001),
    56 O.R. (3d) 505 at para. 94, this court reiterated this principle, stating: “[I]n
    the absence of a constitutional right that requires the government to act
    in the first place, there can be no constitutional right to the continuation
    of measures voluntarily taken, even where those measures accord with or enhance <i>Charter</i> values.”  See
    also <i>Baier v. Alberta</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 673 at paras. 35-36.  I therefore
    turn next to Mr. Flora’s assertion that s. 7 imposes a positive obligation
    on the state to provide, and therefore to fund, life-saving medical treatments.   </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has expressly left open the question of whether a <i>positive</i> right
    to a minimum level of health care exists under s. 7.  In <i>Gosselin v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429 at paras. 81-83, the court
    indicated that s. 7 may one day be interpreted to include positive obligations
    in special circumstances where, at a minimum, the evidentiary record discloses
    actual hardship.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But,
    to date, the protection afforded by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> has not been
    extended to cases – like this one – involving solely economic rights.  As
    this court stated in <i>Wynberg, supra</i> at para. 220, s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> has
    been interpreted “only as restricting the state’s ability to <i>deprive</i> individuals
    of life, liberty or security of the person”. [Emphasis in original.]  See
    also <i>Melanson v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Brunswick (Attorney General) </i>(2007), 280 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>th</span>)

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    does <i>Chaoulli</i> support Mr. Flora’s contention that s. 7 imposes positive
    obligations on the state.  Consider again the unequivocal statement by McLachlin
    C.J. and Major J. at para. 104 of <i>Chaoulli</i>: “The <i>Charter</i> does
    not confer a freestanding constitutional right to health care.”  Moreover,
    as this court observed in <i>Wynberg</i> at para. 222, in <i>Chaoulli</i> the
    claimants did not seek an order requiring the government to fund their private
    health care or to spend more money on health care: “[O]n the contrary, they
    sought the right to spend their own money to obtain insurance to pay for
    private health care services.”  On the facts here, there was no law restricting
    Mr. Flora’s ability to spend his own money to obtain a LRLT at a private
    hospital in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    .  Indeed, that is precisely what he chose to do.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, on the current state of s. 7 constitutional jurisprudence, where – as
    here – the government elects to provide a financial benefit that is not otherwise
    required by law, legislative limitations on the scope of the financial benefit
    provided do not violate s. 7.  On the law at present, the reach of s. 7 does
    not extend to the imposition of a positive constitutional obligation on the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario government to fund out-of-country medical treatments even where the
    treatment in question proves to be life-saving in nature.  </p>

    summary, I agree with the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that Mr. Flora failed to establish a deprivation of his
    rights to life or security of the person under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Moreover,
    the existing jurisprudence does not permit me to interpret s. 7 as imposing
    a constitutional obligation on the respondent to fund out-of-country medical
    treatments beyond those that satisfy the test set out in s. 28.4(2) of the
    Regulation.  In view of these conclusions, it is unnecessary to address Mr.
    Flora’s remaining arguments regarding the conformity of s. 28.4(2) of the
    Regulation with the principles of fundamental justice.   </p>

 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, I am sympathetic to the difficult circumstances and choices
    that confronted Mr. Flora when his liver cancer was detected.  But as compelling
    as his situation undoubtedly was, the heart of this appeal concerns the reasonableness
    of the Board’s decision that public funds were not available under the Act
    to finance Mr. Flora’s medical treatment in England.  For the reasons given,
    I see no basis on which to interfere with the Board’s decision to affirm
    the denial of OHIP funding in this case.</p>

    issues raised on this appeal were novel, at least to some extent.  Certainly

w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario beyond the interests of the involved litigants.  These factors tend
    to support a decision to award no costs of the appeal.  However, the parties
    requested an opportunity to make costs submissions, depending on the disposition
    of this appeal.  Accordingly, if they are unable to agree on costs, and costs
    are sought by the respondent, the respondent may deliver his brief written
    costs submissions to the Registrar of this court within fourteen days from
    the date of these reasons.  Mr. Flora shall deliver his brief responding
    costs submissions to the Registrar within fourteen days thereafter.  </p>
