  <h2>I.          INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.R.,
    a young person within the meaning of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>,
    S.C. 2002, c. 1, was charged with second degree murder, six counts of attempted
    murder and several gun charges.  After a lengthy preliminary inquiry, Young
    J. (the preliminary inquiry judge) of the Ontario Court of Justice (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Youth Justice Court) committed J.S.R. for trial on all counts.  J.S.R. moved
    to quash only the committal on the murder charge.  On February 13, 2008,
    Nordheimer J. of the Superior Court of Justice (the motion judge) granted
    the motion.  He held that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury,
    properly instructed, could convict J.S.R. of murder.  The motion judge was
    satisfied, however, that there was evidence upon which a jury could convict
    on the charge of manslaughter.  He quashed the committal on the murder charge
    and remitted the matter to Young J. for reconsideration in light of his reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.R.
    appeals the order of the motion judge.  His counsel contends that the motion
    judge erred in holding that the preliminary inquiry judge correctly concluded
    that there was evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed,
    could conclude that J.S.R. caused the victim’s death.  Counsel submits that
    absent a proper evidentiary basis for a finding of causation, J.S.R. cannot
    be ordered to stand trial on either a murder or manslaughter charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown also appeals the order of the motion judge.  The Crown argues that
    both the motion judge and the preliminary inquiry judge correctly found that
    there was evidence from which a jury could infer that J.S.R. caused the victim’s
    death.  The Crown submits, however, that the motion judge erred in holding
    that there was no evidence upon which the preliminary inquiry judge could
    be satisfied that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could convict J.S.R.
    of murder.  The Crown contends that the evidence is reasonably capable of
    supporting a conviction on the charge of murder as defined in sections 229(b)
    and 229(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  The Crown
    also relies on the party provisions in s. 21 as imposing accessorial liability
    on J.S.R. for the murder actually committed by another.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.R.’s
    appeal fails and the Crown’s appeal succeeds.  We are satisfied that there
    is an evidentiary basis upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed,
    could conclude that J.S.R. caused the victim’s death.  We are also satisfied
    that the preliminary inquiry judge did not err in holding that the evidence
    could reasonably support a conviction of J.S.R. on a charge of murder as
    defined in s. 229(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  We would restore the order
    committing J.S.R. for trial on the murder charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a brief review of the evidence, we address first the causation question – the
    central issue on J.S.R.’s appeal – and then the issues relating to J.S.R.’s
    potential liability for murder – the issue raised by the Crown’s appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        AN OVERVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    turning to the evidence, it is important to bear in mind that this matter
    is at the preliminary inquiry stage.  There have been no findings of fact,
    much less determinations of liability made.  The defence or the defences
    are unknown; J.S.R. has yet to have an opportunity to present his defence.  He
    is presumed innocent of all charges.  Nothing we say in these reasons should
    be taken as any indication of what will or should be the ultimate findings
    of fact or the ultimate outcome in this case.  Any reference in these reasons
    identifying J.S.R. as a shooter or to any other factual findings are intended
    to refer only to findings that are reasonably available on the evidence heard
    at the preliminary inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the late afternoon of December 26, 2005, Jane Creba, a fifteen year old girl,
    joined thousands of other holidayers on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Yonge Street, one of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto’s main thoroughfares.  Like many others, Ms. Creba was looking for
    Boxing Day bargains.  Suddenly, a full blown gun battle broke out on the
    sidewalk on the west side of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Yonge Street just north of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Dundas Street.  At least three, and perhaps as many as five, shooters exchanged
    multiple shots over the course of several seconds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    one would expect, pandemonium ensued after the shooting started.  By the
    time the gun battle had ended, three innocent bystanders had been shot and
    wounded; as well, three of the individuals alleged to have played some role
    in the gun battle had been shot and wounded.  Jane Creba lay on the ground,
    the victim of a single fatal gunshot wound.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.R.
    was at the scene of the shootout.  He was part of a gang of young people
    standing on the sidewalk on the west side of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Yonge Street just north of the entrance to a store known as the Foot Locker.  He
    was in possession of a loaded, nine millimetre Ruger handgun.  J.S.R., sometimes
    referred to as the southbound shooter, while looking southward on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Yonge Street, fired his weapon several times striking at least six people.  J.S.R.
    was firing southward at a person referred to in the evidence as the “northbound
    shooter”.  That person had exited the Foot Locker shortly after J.S.R. and
    his cohorts had exited that store.  J.S.R. and the others were standing on
    the sidewalk near the entrance to the Foot Locker when the northbound shooter
    exited that store.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    northbound shooter was standing on the sidewalk south of where J.S.R. was
    standing and looking north towards J.S.R.  The northbound shooter made a
    comment to the group of people who included J.S.R.  As he made the comment,
    he lifted his sleeve to reveal a .357 Magnum pistol in his hand.  A rapid
    exchange of gunfire followed.  Ms. Creba and several other bystanders had
    the misfortune to find themselves between the northbound shooter and J.S.R.
    when the gun fight started.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    northbound shooter was standing on the sidewalk on the west side of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Yonge Street facing north.  He fired the .357 Magnum northward toward J.S.R.
    at least three times.  One of those shots struck and killed Ms. Creba.  There
    was no way of knowing whether Ms. Creba was struck by the first shot fired
    by the northbound shooter or one of the subsequent shots.  None of the shots
    fired by J.S.R. struck Ms. Creba.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    of the shots were fired in a short timeframe.  The Crown argues that there
    was evidence from which it could be inferred either that J.S.R. fired first
    or that he took steps to pull out his gun, thereby causing the northbound
    shooter to open fire.  Counsel for J.S.R. submits that there was no evidence
    capable of supporting either inference.  Counsel for J.S.R. contends that,
    on the totality of the evidence, the only reasonable inference is that the
    northbound shooter fired first and that J.S.R., if in fact he was the southbound
    shooter, returned fire.  On the view we take, it is irrelevant for the purposes
    of committal who fired first.</p>
  <h2>III.       THE CAUSTION ISSUE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with counsel’s submission that the determination of whether J.S.R.
    is properly committed to stand trial on any charge relating to Ms. Creba’s
    death must begin with the issue of causation.  If there is no reasonable
    basis upon which a jury could find that J.S.R.’s actions caused Ms. Creba’s
    death, and setting aside for the moment potential liability under s. 21,  then
    J.S.R. could not be committed for trial on either murder or manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>J.S.R.
    did not shoot Ms. Creba.  His actions were not the immediate and direct cause
    of her death.  Causation for the purpose of determining criminal liability
    for homicide is not, however, limited to the direct and immediate cause.  Section
    222(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>A person commits
    homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death
    of a human being.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart
    from making it clear that death may be caused “indirectly” and “by any means”,
    s. 222(1) provides little guidance as to the meaning of causation. The case
    law fills the statutory silence.  Counsel referred to the leading authorities,
    as did the motion judge.  These authorities make it clear that the same causation
    analysis applies to manslaughter and murder charges: <i>R. v. Nette</i> (2001),
    158 C.C.C. (3d) 486 at para. 66 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Meiler</i> (1999), 136
    C.C.C. (3d) 11 at para. 45 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Causation has both a factual and legal component: <i>R.
    v. Nette</i> at paras. 44-45.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no need to enter upon an abstract discussion of causation.  The general
    principles are not in dispute; rather, counsel raised two particular causation
    issues relevant to this appeal: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Could
    the jury reasonably conclude that J.S.R.’s actions were a contributing cause,
    beyond <i>de minimis</i>, to the death of Ms. Creba?</li>
    <li>Did
      the act of the northbound shooter in firing his gun and inflicting the
      fatal wound on Ms. Creba constitute an intervening cause that severed any

    first of these two issues addresses factual causation and is generally resolved
    by a “but for” analysis of the factual chain of events culminating in the
    death of the victim.  The second issue is concerned with the legal component
    of causation.  The legal component of the causation inquiry asks whether
    J.S.R., even if there was a
    “but for” link between his actions and Ms. Creba’s death, should be held
    responsible in the eyes of the law for her death given the actions of the
    northbound shooter.  </p>

    question as posed above begs a preliminary question – what is meant by the
    actions of J.S.R.?  The preliminary inquiry judge and the motion judge characterized
    J.S.R.’s actions for the purposes of the causation inquiry in two different
    ways.  In committing J.S.R. for trial on the charge of second degree murder,
    the preliminary inquiry judge held that the totality of the evidence could
    support a finding that J.S.R. chose to participate in a mutual shootout with
    the northbound shooter on a crowded downtown street, that both J.S.R. and
    the northbound shooter fired their weapons into the crowd in furtherance
    of their decisions, and that Ms. Creba died in the shootout.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my opinion
    there is evidence for the jury to reasonably conclude that the accused’s
    participation in the shootout was a “significant contributing cause” of the
    death of Jane Creba.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge did not consider whether the evidence was capable of supporting
    the preliminary inquiry judge’s characterization of J.S.R.’s conduct.  Instead,
    he conducted his own examination of the evidence.  The motion judge found
    (at paras. 19-21) that there was no evidence from which a jury could infer
    that J.S.R. fired the first shot.  He further found that there was ample
    evidence from which a jury could find that J.S.R. returned fire after the
    northbound shooter’s initial volley and that a mutual exchange of shots followed.  The
    motion judge also noted that it was agreed that no one could say whether
    it was the northbound shooter’s first shot or a later shot that killed Ms.
    Creba.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    established what he saw as the necessary evidentiary backdrop to the causation
    question, the motion judge then said at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue then
    becomes whether the act of shooter #2 [J.S.R.] firing back could be a contributing
    cause of the death of the victim on the basis that, but for shooter #2 [J.S.R.]
    firing back, shooter #1 [the northbound shooter] might not have fired any
    further shots which, in turn, raises the possibility that the fatal shot
    might not have been fired.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the applicable law, the motion judge concluded at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]here is some
    evidence upon which a jury might conclude that shooter #1 [the northbound
    shooter] would not have continued to shoot but for shooter #2 [J.S.R.] returning
    fire.  In other words, the jury might conclude that had shooter #2 [J.S.R.]
    not pulled out a gun and fired at shooter #1 [the northbound shooter], only
    one shot would ever have been fired.  Whether that was the fatal shot is,
    of course, a separate factual question that the jury will have to determine.</p>

    counsel for J.S.R. and the Crown take issue with aspects of the motion judge’s
    causation analysis.  Counsel for J.S.R. submits that the motion judge correctly
    identified the only reasonable interpretation of the evidence insofar as
    it relates to J.S.R.’s conduct for the purposes of the causation inquiry.  Counsel
    contends that on the evidence a reasonable jury could only conclude that
    J.S.R. fired at the northbound shooter in retaliation after the northbound
    shooter had fired at least one shot in his direction.  Counsel characterizes
    J.S.R.’s conduct as returning the gunfire initiated by the northbound shooter.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for J.S.R. submits that although the motion judge properly identified the
    nature of J.S.R.’s conduct, he erred in concluding that it could reasonably
    support the conclusion that J.S.R. caused Ms. Creba’s death.  Counsel stresses
    that it was common ground that there was no way of knowing which shot fired
    by the northbound shooter killed Ms. Creba.  Consequently, a reasonable jury
    could not exclude the possibility that Ms. Creba was hit by the first shot
    fired by the northbound shooter and, therefore, fatally wounded before J.S.R.
    retaliated by firing his weapon.  On that scenario, counsel submits that
    J.S.R.’s retaliatory return of fire could not have contributed to Ms. Creba’s
    death.  As the jury could not exclude this scenario, it could not reasonably
    be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that J.S.R. had caused the death of
    Ms. Creba.</p>

    Crown submits that the motion judge erred by going beyond his limited supervisory
    role on a motion to quash and choosing one factual scenario available on
    the evidence from among the various factual scenarios that are reasonably
    available on the evidence.  The Crown contends that the motion judge’s interpretation
    of the evidence, particularly his conclusion that J.S.R. did not shoot first,
    is not the only reasonable interpretation available on the totality of the
    evidence.    </p>

    counsel submits that another available reasonable scenario is the mutual
    gun fight scenario referred to by the preliminary inquiry judge in committing
    J.S.R. for trial on the murder charge.  The Crown contends that on the entirety
    of the evidence a reasonable jury could infer that the gun fight, during
    which Ms. Creba was caught in the crossfire and killed, was a joint endeavour
    between two rival groups, both armed with loaded guns, both unwilling to
    retreat and both prepared to open fire on a sidewalk crowded with innocent
    bystanders.  On this view of the evidence, J.S.R. and the northbound shooter,
    as well as others in their groups, had decided to shoot it out on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

    including J.S.R., the northbound shooter and their associates, had decided
    before the shots were fired to engage in a gun battle on a public street
    outside the Foot Locker.  On this view, J.S.R. and the northbound shooter
    were shooting at each other; J.S.R. was not merely returning the fire initiated
    by the northbound shooter.  The order in which the shots were fired is not
    important to the causation analysis on this factual scenario. </p>

    concluded that the evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the mutual

    analogous to causation questions in the car racing cases where one of the
    participants in the car race hits a bystander and causes injury or death.  In
    such cases, both drivers may be held to have caused that injury or death:  see <i>R.

    in the car race in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Those at risk
    from the unreasonable and unjustified danger of an escapade of competitive
    driving, whether a spontaneous or planned event, include the occupants of
    other vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, passengers in the racers’ autos, and
    the co-participants themselves.  <u>There is one danger.  Each driver bears
    equal responsibility for its continued life span subject to withdrawal or
    [an] intervening event.</u>  As each driver in effect induces the other to
    drive in an unlawfully unsafe manner, each is taken to assume any consequential
    risk objectively within the ambit of the danger created.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    the words of Hill J. and applying them to this case, a reasonable jury could
    find that each shooter induced the other to engage in a gun fight on a crowded
    street. “But for” the decision to engage in a gun fight on a crowded street
    and the resulting exchange of bullets, Ms. Creba would not have been killed.</p>

    causal connection between that victim’s death and the prior act of the accused
    even though the prior act remains a factual or “but for” cause of the victim’s
    death.  In these circumstances, despite the existence of factual causation,
    it is said to be unfair to impute legal liability for the death to a person
    whose actions have been effectively overtaken by the more immediate causal
    action of another party acting independently: see G. Williams, <i>Textbook
    of Criminal Law</i>, 2d ed. (London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1983) at 390-91; <i>R.

    by a third party who is not acting independently but is acting in furtherance
    of a joint activity undertaken by the accused and that third party will not
    sever the legal causal connection.  For example, in the racing cases, Driver
    A and Driver B may be racing together along crowded streets each driving
    recklessly trying to beat the other.  If Driver A strikes a pedestrian, thereby
    directly causing her death, Driver B, as a participant in the race, may also
    be held to have caused her death.  Driver A’s striking of the pedestrian
    can be seen not as an independent act but as a part of the joint action (racing
    on a public street) that resulted in the death of the pedestrian.  A similar
    causation analysis has been applied in American “gun battle” cases which
    are distressingly factually similar to this case: <i>e.g.</i> see

    the Crown’s theory of J.S.R.’s accessorial liability, the northbound shooter
    is the perpetrator of the murder of Ms. Creba.  The northbound shooter’s
    liability for that murder rests on s. 229(b).  According to the Crown, the
    northbound shooter shot and killed Ms. Creba, intending to shoot and kill
    J.S.R.  To establish the northbound shooter’s liability for murder under
    that section, the Crown will have to show that the northbound shooter fired
    his gun intending to kill J.S.R.  It seems strange that J.S.R. could somehow
    be said to have aided and abetted a murder the <i>mens rea </i>of which was
    the intention to kill J.S.R.</p>

    repeat, both aiding and abetting require proof that the alleged accessory
    intended to assist the perpetrator in the crime committed by the perpetrator.  There
    is no evidence that J.S.R. did anything with the intention of helping or
    encouraging the northbound shooter to murder J.S.R.</p>

    the reasons already explained, the joint actions of J.S.R. and the northbound
    shooter could be found to have caused Ms. Creba’s death.  The inquiry which
    fixes causal responsibility for joint actions is, however, distinct from
    the inquiry which fixes accessorial liability for a crime committed by another.  The
    Crown’s interpretation of ss. 21(1)(b) and (c) invites a tortured reading
    of those provisions and conflates causation questions with those relevant
    to accessorial liability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s reliance on s. 21(2) is also misplaced on the evidence as adduced
    at the preliminary inquiry.  That section expressly requires a common intention
    between the person who actually commits the crime and the person who is rendered
    liable for that crime under s. 21(2).  The common intention must be “to carry
    out an unlawful purpose” and “to assist each other therein”.  Section 21(2)
    speaks to situations in which two individuals pursue a common unlawful object
    together and one of them commits an offence other than the common unlawful
    object in the course of pursuing that common purpose.  In such circumstances,
    the party to the initial common unlawful purpose will sometimes be held criminally
    responsible for the crime committed by his joint venturer in pursuit of their
    shared common purpose:  see <i>R. v. Popen</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was evidence that J.S.R. and the northbound shooter were engaged in a joint
    activity.  Joint activity cannot necessarily be equated with common intention.  On
    the Crown’s case, J.S.R.’s purpose was to kill the northbound shooter and
    the northbound shooter’s purpose was to kill J.S.R. – hardly a common intention!  Nor
    does the evidence provide any support for a finding that J.S.R. and the northbound
    shooter shared an intention to assist each other in the achievement of some
    unlawful purpose.  Their conduct suggests the antithesis of mutual assistance.</p>

    with the Crown’s attempt to apply the aiding or abetting provisions to the
    facts of this case, imposing liability on J.S.R. through s. 21(2) is not
    supported by a plain reading of the section and is contrary to common sense.  On
    the present state of the evidence, if s. 21(2) were left with a jury, the
    jury could well be confused and distracted by instructions suggesting it
    could find a common intention to pursue a joint object between two individuals
    who were trying to kill each other.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>First, the acts of the offender that caused the death must have been
      done for the purpose of an “unlawful object”. It is well established that
      s. 229(c) contemplates some act or conduct by the offender done to bring
      about some further unlawful object other than the injury that causes the
      death. Put another way, the unlawful object must be a different object
      than the assault upon the deceased that gives rise to the charge under
      s. 229(c).</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>Further,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>The
      second <i>mens rea</i> requirement in s. 229(c) is that the offender knows
      that the act or acts that are done for the purpose of the unlawful object
      are likely to cause death, notwithstanding he desires to effect his object
      without causing death or bodily harm to any human being. This creates a

      an endnote at p. 30, O’Connor J.A. pointed out that the “human being” referred
      to in the concluding “notwithstanding” clause does not include any person
      who may be the subject of the intended unlawful object.  He further observed,
      at para. 58, that in order to attract liability under this section, an
      offender need not “foresee the precise situation or all of the events that
      result in the death”; rather, the offender must foresee “that the acts
      done for the unlawful object are likely to cause death and those acts are
      sufficiently linked to the death to have caused the death within the meaning
      of the section”.  As he explained at para. 61, no greater precision was

      those facts, we are satisfied that J.S.R. comes within the parameters of
      s.&nbsp;229(c).  Manifestly, in our view, if proved, his conduct would
      meet the high degree of moral blameworthiness needed to justify the stigma
      of a murder conviction and the consequences flowing from it.</span></p>
  <h2>V.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons set out above, we would restore the committal of J.S.R. on the
    charge of second degree murder.  We repeat that these reasons speak to the
    existence of evidence at the preliminary inquiry upon which a reasonable
    trier of fact could make certain findings.  Nothing in the reasons is intended
    to exclude other possible views of the facts or to dictate how the issues
    should be approached at trial.  There are no doubt other factual scenarios
    open on this evidence, including perhaps the one favoured by the motion judge.  Furthermore,
    the evidence adduced at trial may well give rise to factual scenarios that
    are different than those reasonably available on the evidence adduced at
    the preliminary inquiry.  It is the evidence heard at trial that must ultimately
    determine the legal issues and theories of liability upon which the trial
    judge must instruct the jury.  </p>

    appeal brought by J.S.R. is dismissed.  The Crown appeal is allowed and the
    committal for trial on the charge of second degree murder is restored.</p>

    s. 21(1)(c), the abetting section. The Crown in its written material referred
    to both aiding, s. 21(1)(b), and abetting, s. 21(1)(c).  For present purposes,
    the analysis of J.S.R.’s potential liability as a party to a murder is the
    same under the two sections.  </p>
