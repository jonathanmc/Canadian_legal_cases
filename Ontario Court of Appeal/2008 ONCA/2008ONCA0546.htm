lang=EN-US>The appellant filed an Inmate Notice of Appeal on May 12, 2004 against
      his conviction and sentence for first degree murder and aggravated assault

lang=EN-US>On June 15, 2005, Robert Goddard of the Correctional Law Project of
      Queen’s University, wrote the Court recommending that amicus curiae be
      appointed rather than counsel, given the complexity of the appellant’s
      case, and the ongoing difficulty communicating with and receiving instructions
      from the appellant. As Mr. Mends had to appear before the court on June
      21, 2005, Mr. Goddard communicated with Breese Davies of Ruby and Edwardh
      who agreed to act as amicus if her schedule allowed and undertook that
      some other member of Ruby and Edwardh would act if she was unable to do
      so.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On June 21, 2005, Mr. Mends appeared before the Court, and the Crown
      concurred with Mr. Goddard’s recommendation.  As a result, Ms Davies was
      appointed amicus. Ms. Davies, due to her unavailability, subsequently requested
      Delmar Doucette of Ruby and Edwardht to take carriage of this matter. On
      September 28, 2005 the court then appointed Delmar Doucette as amicus curiae
      as requested by Ms. Davies.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>This is a case that involved one ground of ineffective assistance
      of counsel argued by the appellant on his own behalf on September 19, 2007.
      Mr. Doucette supported a limited aspect of the appellant’s argument and
      raised two additional grounds of appeal.  The court heard argument by Mr.
      Doucette and the Crown and reserved judgment.  On October 1, 2007, for
      reasons released that day, the Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Doucette billed his work to the Attorney General though a series
      of twelve accounts. There was no dispute as to the number of hours worked
      or as to the disbursements paid. The only dispute was the appropriate hourly
      rate to be paid for the hours worked. Mr. Doucette has billed at two-thirds
      his private rate being $200.00 per hour up to December 31, 2006, and then
      a modest increase to $235.00 per hour thereafter. The Attorney General
      has paid at the Legal Aid rate.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>At the hearing of the taxation of fees and disbursements, Mr. Doucette
      submitted that there was no dispute with the amount of hours worked or
      the disbursements on the file as the case was a complicated case to which
      the Crown agreed. The communication with the appellant was extremely difficult
      and time consuming and Mr. Doucette commenced a series of meetings with
      the appellant which were necessary, as the appellant had numerous issues
      to discuss. Mr. Doucette not only answered the appellant’s questions but
      also focused the appellant’s disorganized thoughts so that he could put
      the appellant’s concerns before the court in an appropriate and coherent
      manner as well as assist the appellant to ensure that the oral submissions
      made by the appellant in court was also in an appropriate manner.   Investigative
      work was necessary, and Mr. Doucette maintained a good trusting relationship
      with the appellant throughout the process. The court also recorded its
      appreciation for Mr. Doucette’s assistance in this difficult case in the
      reasons released.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>8)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>With respect to the travel time, Mr. Doucette submitted that there
      were several trips to Kingston and wherever there was other work involved,
      only one half of the cost of travel time was billed. The dispute was the
      appropriate hourly rate for the hours worked and travel time. </span></p>

'><span
lang=EN-US>9)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The crown raised the issue that counsel was aware that the practice
      of the crown is to pay legal aid rates in such circumstances and yet Mr.
      Doucette accepted to take carriage of the file. The Crown also submits
      that the case was progressively less complex once the psychiatric issues
      were resolved. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
lang=EN-US>10)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Mr. Doucette submitted that all the work completed on this file was
      difficult throughout but became easier over time. However, Mr. Doucette,
      even though aware of the position of the crown with respect to payment
      at legal aid rates, accepted the file based on the decision of the Deputy
      Registrar in Barton, George and McKenzie. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
lang=EN-US>11)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I agree that the case was a complex and difficult one
      and do not feel that the hourly rates submitted by Mr. Doucette for his
      counsel work are unreasonable in the circumstances, given his general expertise
      and appellate experience in such matters. </span><span lang=EN-US>I do not consider that the increase
      in his hourly rate should not be recognized, given that it no doubt reflects
      the realities of the increasing costs in the private practice of criminal
      law and the fact that he has billed two-thirds of the amount of his private
      practice which reflects the public service aspect of appearing as amicus. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%'><span lang=EN-US>However, I take a somewhat different
      view with respect to travel time. I feel that in the circumstances all
      travel time should be billed at $100.00 per hour.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
'><span
lang=EN-US>12)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I will therefore tax Mr. Doucette’s account for hourly work done at
      $200.00 up to and including December 31 2006, $235 for work done thereafter,
      and all travel time at $100.00.  </span></p>
