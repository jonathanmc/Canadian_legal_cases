  <h1><span lang=EN-US>TAXATION OF FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS </span></h1>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The appellant filed an
        Inmate Notice of Appeal on March 27, 2006 against his convictions for
        aggravated assault and subsequently filed a supplementary notice of appeal
        on June 28, 2006 to include the sentences imposed.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=2 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The procedural history
        of this case is very convoluted. The appellant attacked the mayor of
      <st1:City w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Niagara Falls with a cane and also menaced the mayor’s executive assistant
      when the assistant came to the mayor’s aid. The appellant was arrested
      and tried by a jury presided over by Mr. Justice N. Borkovich. The appellant,
      who suffers from a mental disorder, stated that he would not retain counsel
      and would represent himself. The appellant did not truly participate in
      the trial and the jury found him guilty of attempted murder on the mayor
      and an assault with a weapon on the mayor’s executive assistant. The appellant
      was then sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for the attempted murder
      and 2 years imprisonment, concurrent, for the assault with a weapon.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=3 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appealed
        against conviction and sentence. On March 1, 2001, this court accepted
        the crown’s argument that the appellant, due to his mental disorder,
        had not been fit to strand trial and the appellant’s argument that he
        had been denied his statutory right to challenge jurors for cause. The
        court therefore allowed the appellant’s appeal against conviction, quashed
        the conviction, ordered a new trial and remitted the case to the Ontario
        Board of Review.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=4 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>Many years had passed
        before the appellant was found fit to stand trial. There were several
        aborted attempts to commence a second trial, which ended in mistrials.
        The trial was before a jury presided over by Mr. Justice Hambly and the
        appellant again represented himself but did not truly participate in
        the trial. The appellant was found not guilty of an attempted murder,
        but guilty of an aggravated assault on the mayor, and guilty of an assault
        with a weapon on the mayor’s executive assistant. A sentence of 14 years
        imprisonment was imposed. Once again, an appeal was launched to this
        court against the conviction, and subsequently against conviction and
        sentence.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=5 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>On February 14, 2007,
        the appellant appeared before the Honourable Justice Feldman, and informed
        her that he wished to represent himself. As a result of the appellant’s
        mental health history, he did not historically appear to be capable of
        properly representing himself, and upon request from the Crown, Justice
        Feldman agreed to appoint Mr. Doucette as amicus curiae to assist the
        Court in the circumstances. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=6 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not
        wish to cooperate with any amicus, and requested that Mr. Doucette be
        removed as amicus. The Crown moved for directions and asked that Mr.
        Doucette be maintained in his role as amicus. However, the Honourable
        Justice Rouleau decided that the appearance of justice would best be
        served if a new amicus was appointed.  As a result, Michael Lacy was
        then appointed. Mr. Doucette agreed to meet with Mr. Lacy to facilitate
        an orderly and efficient transfer of the file and to explain the relevant
        issues.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=7 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Doucette billed his
        work to the Attorney General through a series of three accounts at  $235.00
        per hour which is two-thirds of his private rate. The Attorney General
        has paid at the Legal Aid Rate at $92.30 per hour for work up to and
        including March 31, 2007, and at $96.95 per hour for work done thereafter.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=8 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>On May 22 2008, I heard
        submissions with respect to Mr. Doucette’s application, made pursuant
        to s 684 (3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to fix the disputed fees, <i>and</i> reserved
        my decision.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=9 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>At the hearing of the
        taxation of fees and disbursements, Mr. Doucette submitted, and the Crown
        agreed, that there was no dispute with the amount of hours worked or
        the disbursements on the file, as the case was a complicated case.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=10 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The communication with
        the appellant was extremely difficult, the records on this matter were
        dense and opaque and Mr. Doucette had to disentangle the various facets
        of the records in order to properly report to the Court. Communication
        with the appellant was extremely difficult as the appellant refused to
        speak with Mr. Doucette or any other amicus. Mr. Doucette, as a result,
        used the only sources for the appellant’s grounds of appeal that were
        available, which were his Notices of Appeal, and these were far from
        clear. In order to clarify the grounds, Mr. Doucette had to carefully
        and thoroughly review the entire record in order to interpret the grounds
        found in the Notices, and provide the best possible analysis of the relevant
        facts and legal issues. This was necessary not only to assist the appellant
        to make his self-represented arguments, but also to allow the Court to
        understand the appellant’s complaints and whether there was any merit
        to these complaints.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=11 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>It was submitted that
        the case is a serious one due to the sentence imposed, which is the lengthiest
        sentence allowed by the Criminal Code other than a sentence of life imprisonment.
        An issue the Crown raised on the appeal was that the appellant should
        be found NCR. If the court agreed, the appellant will face an indeterminate
        term of hospitalization.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=12 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>The crown submitted that
        when he agreed to take carriage of the file, Mr. Doucette was aware that
        the “policy” of the crown was to pay legal aid rates in such circumstances.
        However, Mr. Doucette, even though aware of the position of the crown
        with respect to payment at legal aid rates, accepted the file based on
        the decisions in <i>R. v. Barton, R. v. George, and R. v. McKenzie</i>.  In
        those cases, the deputy registrar held that the clear wording of s 684
        (3) of the <i>Code </i>did not limit the fees paid to court appointed
        counsel or amicus curiae to the legal aid rate, or any other rate unilaterally
        determined by a policy of the Crown.  Indeed the very wording of that
        provision supports a conclusion that the rate is to be agreed on by the
        parties or failing agreement, fixed by the registrar in consideration
        of the circumstances of each case. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=13 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Doucette billed at
        a rate of two-thirds of the amount of his private practice which is $235.00
        per hour, which he submitted, reflects the public service aspect of appearing
        as amicus. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <ol start=14 type=1>
    <li style='line-height:100%;     '><span lang=EN-US>I agree that this case
        was a complex and difficult one, and do not feel that the hourly rates
        submitted by Mr. Doucette for his counsel work are unreasonable in the
        circumstances, given his general expertise and appellate experience in
        such matters. I will therefore tax Mr. Doucette’s hourly rate, as requested,
        at $235.00 per hour and direct that the Attorney General pay Mr. Doucette’s
        fees in full.</span></li>
