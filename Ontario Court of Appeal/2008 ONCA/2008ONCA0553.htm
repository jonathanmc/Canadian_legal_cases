  <h2>1.         Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    motion to quash the defendants’ appeal to this court raises the issue of
    whether an order that determines a preliminary factual matter relevant to
    a defendant’s liability is final or interlocutory. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs in this medical malpractice action are seeking damages arising
    from the defendants’ treatment of the plaintiff, Christos Stoiantsis, for
    a heart condition.  The parties agreed to a trial of an issue for the purpose
    of determining the threshold question of whether one of the defendants, Dr.
    Christos Spirou, advised Mr. Stoiantsis to take the drug Coumadin.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    a nine-day hearing, Pomerance J. decided the issue in the plaintiffs’ favour.  The
    defendants appealed the order to this court.  In response, the plaintiffs
    move to quash the appeal on the ground that the order appealed from is interlocutory
    and that any appeal properly lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, with leave, pursuant to the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, ss. 6(1)(b) and 19(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the order under appeal is final
    and that the motion to quash must be dismissed.</p>
  <h2>II.        The History </h2>
  <h2><u>A.</u>        <u>Factual Background</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Stoiantsis consulted Drs. Christos Spirou and Rajendra Chetty, his family
    doctor and cardiologist respectively, after suffering several episodes of
    atrial fibrillation.  One of these episodes occurred in mid-February 1998
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona where the family wintered.  A physician in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona prescribed Coumadin, but after a single dose, Mr. Stoiantsis stopped
    taking it because a friend persuaded him that it was “rat poison”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    returning to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario in April 1998, Mr. Stoiantsis began to see Dr. Spirou.  At this appointment,
    Mrs. Stoiantsis informed Dr. Spirou that Mr. Stoiantsis had been counselled
    to take Coumadin but that he had refused to take it because he had been told
    that it was rat poison.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    this appointment, Dr. Spirou referred Mr. Stoiantsis to Dr. Chetty.  Mr.
    Stoiantsis met with Dr. Chetty on July 28, 1998.  In a report to Dr. Spirou
    dated September 8, 1998, Dr. Chetty suggests that Mr. Stoiantsis could be
    left on another medication, but be put on Coumadin in the future.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Stoiantsis saw Dr. Spirou several times throughout the summer and early fall
    of 1998.  In his clinical records dated September 18, 1998, Dr. Spirou notes
    that he spent a great deal of time discussing Coumadin with Mr. Stoiantsis
    and that he advised Mr. Stoiantsis that Coumadin was appropriate given his
    risk factors.  Mr. Stoiantsis is adamant that Dr. Spirou never discussed
    Coumadin at this meeting or otherwise.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    November 1998, Mr. Stoiantsis returned to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona; shortly thereafter he suffered a debilitating stroke.  The plaintiffs
    then brought a claim against the doctors.</p>
  <h2><u>B.</u>        <u>Procedural History</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    their statement of claim, the plaintiffs allege that Drs. Spirou and Chetty
    were negligent in failing to advise Mr. Stoiantsis to take Coumadin.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    their joint statement of defence, the doctors plead, among other things,
    that Dr. Spirou met the standard of care by counselling Mr. Stoiantsis to
    take Coumadin.  According to the doctors’ pleadings, the stroke Mr. Stoiantsis
    suffered was not due to their conduct but to the fact that Mr. Stoiantsis
    steadfastly refused to take Coumadin.  In support of their position, they
    refer to Dr. Spirou’s September 18, 1998 clinical notes, which contain references
    to his having counselled Mr. Stoiantsis to take Coumadin.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 13, 2003, the plaintiffs moved before a master for an order bifurcating
    the trial: the plaintiffs proposed to separate the issue of the standard
    of care from those of causation and damages.  By order dated April 17, 2003,
    the master ruled that the action be bifurcated and that the issue of standard
    of care be tried first. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants appealed the order.  Rather than proceed with the appeal, the
    parties entered into minutes of settlement, dated November 7, 2003, in which
    they agreed to a trial of the threshold issues of what recommendations Dr.
    Spirou made to Mr. Stoiantsis regarding the use of Coumadin and whether Dr.
    Spirou’s notes had been altered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the plaintiffs, the question of whether Dr. Spirou had recommended that
    Mr. Stoiantsis take Coumadin was a threshold issue that could be determined
    expeditiously, and one that would bring the lawsuit to an end if the finding
    were made that he had done so.  The parties further agreed, therefore, that
    if the court found that Dr. Spirou had counselled Mr. Stoiantsis to take
    Coumadin and that his notes were accurate, the action would be dismissed.  If
    the court found that Dr. Spirou had not counselled Mr. Stoiantsis to take
    Coumadin, (meaning, that he had altered his notes) the action would proceed
    to trial on all remaining issues. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a 9-day trial of an issue, the trial judge, in very full reasons, found as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Spirou did not at any time recommend that Mr. Stoiantsis take Coumadin; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Spirou’s notes of September 18, 1998 (which referred to Coumadin being recommended)
    were not accurate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is from this order that the defendants have appealed, and it is in response
    to this appeal that the plaintiffs have brought their motion to quash.</p>
  <h2>III.       Parties’ Positions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs’ argument that the order under appeal is interlocutory is grounded
    on the fact that the trial judge’s determination of the Coumadin issue does
    not finally dispose of the defendants’
    claim.  The order merely makes findings of fact, albeit important findings,
    upon which a trial on the legal issues (breach of the standard of care, causation
    and damages) can proceed.  According to the plaintiffs, since the merits
    of the case remain to be determined, the order is interlocutory.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants submit that the order is final for the simple reason that it finally
    disposes of a defence.  They argue that a defence is a factual situation
    that, if proven, entitles a defendant to judgment. According to the defendants,
    the facts, the law and the minutes of settlement all support the conclusion
    that the issue determined resolved whether a potential defence was available;
    the order under appeal is therefore final.</p>
  <h2>IV.       Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test of whether an order is final or interlocutory is set forth in <i>Hendrickson
    v. Kallio,</i> [1932] O.R. 675 at 678 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The interlocutory order from which there is no appeal
    is an order which does not determine the real matter in dispute between the
    parties – the very subject matter of the litigation, but only some matter
    collateral.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Hendrickson</i> has
    been followed by many decisions dealing with the endlessly debated issue
    of what constitutes a final versus interlocutory order.  A decision that
    is often cited is <i>Ball v. Donais</i> (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). In <i>Ball,</i> the defendant moved under rule 21.01(1)(a) for a determination
    before trial of a question of law raised by the pleadings relating to the
    application of a limitation period provision.  The motions court judge decided
    the question against the defendant.  This court held that the judge’s order
    was final, reasoning at 324:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The effect of the order of Daudlin J. was to preclude
    the defendant’s entitlement to raise thereafter, as a defence to this action,
    the plaintiff’s failure to sue within the limitation period prescribed by
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  <i>While that order did not finally dispose
    of the rights of the parties to the litigation, it did, subject to appeal
    therefrom, finally dispose of the issue raised by that defence, and thereby
    deprived the defendant of a substantive right which could be determinative
    of the entire action. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Ball </i>extends
    the reasoning in <i>Hendrickson</i> and establishes that even where an order
    does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties to the litigation,
    it will be final for the purposes of appeal if it disposes of an issue raised
    by way of defence and “thereby deprive[s] the defendant of a substantive
    right which could be determinative of the entire action.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question then is whether the order in issue deprives the defendants of a
    substantive right that could be determinative of the action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, that question should be answered in the affirmative. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    procedural history and the minutes of settlement both demonstrate that the
    purpose of dealing with the so-called threshold matter of whether Dr. Spirou
    advised Mr. Stoiantsis to take Coumadin was to facilitate the early resolution
    of an issue that was of significant importance to the outcome of the action.
    The parties recognized that the defence that the doctors recommended Coumadin,
    if successful, would have been a complete answer to the claim. </p>

    indistinguishable from the present case.  Subject to appeal, the order disposed
    of an issue raised by the defendants that deprived them of a substantive
    right that could have been determinative of the entire action</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further
    support for this conclusion is found by resort to the doctrine of <i>res
    judicata.</i>  To determine whether an order is final or interlocutory, courts
    often consider whether the issue can be said to be <i>res judicata</i>: see <i>S.(R.)
    v. H.(R.) </i>(2000), 52 O.R. (3d) 152 at para. 19-21 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Even though some orders only partially resolve issues between the parties,
    if the resolution of the particular question would give rise to an argument
    of <i>res judicata</i>, then the order is final despite other issues remaining
    outstanding.  Had Pomerance J. struck out the relevant paragraphs or portions
    of paragraphs of the joint statement of defence, it would have been clear
    that the defence was <i>res judicata.</i>  Although that was not done, her
    reasons show the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applies to the issues she
    determined.</p>

    manner in which the parties proceeded with this action has made things more
    complex, but this complexity does not alter the simplicity of this determination
    - the order under appeal deprives the defendants of a defence.  It is therefore
    final, and this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the motion to quash the appeal.  The defendants
    are entitled to their agreed upon costs in the amount of $2300, including
    disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
