  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Cosmo Pasqualino, was convicted of one count of second degree
    murder in the shooting death of his wife, Marisa Pasqualino. He was sentenced
    to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole until he has served 13
    years. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    many years the marital relationship between the appellant and his wife had
    been stormy and unsettled. There was evidence that the appellant, over the
    years, had repeatedly subjected his wife to both physical and verbal abuse,
    including utterances that he would kill her if she ever tried to leave him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    days before her death, the appellant’s wife informed his brother over the
    telephone that she would be leaving the appellant, and demanded that her
    husband repay monies which she had loaned to him. Subsequently the appellant,
    while alone with his wife in the matrimonial home, shot her to death, discharging
    the entire six-round clip of his handgun into her. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant did not dispute that he had shot his wife, nor did he
    dispute that the shooting was unlawful. What he did assert was that he had
    been provoked by his wife immediately prior to shooting her and that he lacked
    the requisite specific intent for the offence of second degree murder. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary issue on the appeal from conviction rests upon the trial judge’s
    admission into evidence, following a lengthy <i>voir dire</i>, of a number
    of ante-mortem statements of the deceased, together with evidence of previous
    threats and acts of violence by the appellant toward the deceased. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also requests leave to appeal his sentence on the grounds that
    it was harsh and excessive. </p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and the deceased immigrated to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    when they were young. They met around 1983 and were married shortly thereafter.
    At the time, she was 18 years old and he was 26. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
    finishing college, the appellant purchased a pizzeria business with the help
    of his two brothers, Tony and Mike. At the beginning of the marriage, the
    business was very prosperous. The brothers then purchased the building next
    door and opened a restaurant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    brothers also purchased condominiums in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Toronto and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga to supplement their income, and all lived only minutes away from
    each other. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    a variety of reasons, monetary problems started to arise, which created marital
    difficulties for the appellant and the deceased. The brothers closed the
    restaurant in 1999 but continued running the pizzeria. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1993, the Appellant had three one-night stands and one affair. After the
    birth of their fourth child, Vince, in 1994, the appellant confessed the
    affair to the deceased, although he did not reveal the three one-night stands.
    After learning of the affair, the deceased left with the children and resided
    with her parents for five days, before returning to the matrimonial home. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    marriage continued with arguments between the appellant and the deceased
    becoming regular events and included assaults against the deceased. I will
    say more about these later as they become relevant to these reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, on Apr. 29, 2002, the deceased telephoned the appellant’s brother
    Mike to discuss the $500 that she had lent the appellant for the pizzeria.
    The conversation soon escalated into an argument, with the deceased informing
    Mike that she was going to leave the appellant, and Mike in response giving
    her a warning that she interpreted as a death threat. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 1, when the deceased and the appellant were alone in the marital home,
    an argument broke out between them concerning the appellant’s infidelities
    and the $500 that he owed her. The appellant testified that the deceased
    said that she was leaving him and that he “did not even satisfy her anymore”.
    The appellant took this comment to mean that he was no longer able to sexually
    satisfy her. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant became enraged and shot the deceased with his handgun a total of
    six times, twice in the torso and four times in the head. A number of the
    shots were fired from close range. The shooting used up all of the rounds
    in the handgun. The appellant claims to only remember standing over the deceased’s
    body after the shooting, but not the shooting itself. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted by a jury presided over by Justice Clair Marchand.
    As the trial judge did not request that the jury provide a sentencing recommendation
    on parole ineligibility prior to discharging it, he assumed that the jury
    would have recommended the minimum statutory period of 10 years. He then
    imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with a 13-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <h2>ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    case for the Crown at trial included evidence that the appellant had subjected
    the deceased to numerous instances of both physical and verbal abuse over
    the years and, that he repeatedly threatened to kill her if she attempted
    to leave him. In this regard, the trial judge admitted into evidence a number
    of ante-mortem statements of the deceased, along with evidence of previous
    threats and acts of violence by the appellant toward the deceased. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant originally appealed on three grounds related to: (i) the trial
    judge’s rulings with respect to the admissibility of bad character evidence
    and hearsay evidence, including numerous ante-mortem statements of the deceased;
    (ii) the refusal of the trial judge to declare a mistrial; and (iii) the
    trial judge’s decision to set parole ineligibility at 13 years. Prior to
    oral argument, the appellant abandoned the issue respecting the mistrial
    but added another ground not advanced in either the notice of appeal or in
    his factum. The additional ground attacks the trial judge’s charge to the
    jury, alleging that the trial judge erred because he: i) failed to provide
    a proper instruction the jury on the permissible use of hearsay evidence;
    ii) failed to provide an instruction cautioning the jury about the proper
    use of bad character evidence; iii) unfairly referred to the appellant as “somewhat
    scary”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    allowed the appellant to proceed with the additional ground of appeal since
    it was so related to the issue of the ante-mortem statements. Additionally,
    Crown counsel was prepared to address the issue given that he was granted
    two days time to prepare his argument and respond to the submissions of appellant’s
    counsel. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the following reasons, I conclude that none of the appellant’s grounds of
    appeal against conviction justifies interfering with the jury’s verdict and
    I would therefore dismiss the appeal. Also, I would dismiss the appeal against
    the trial judge’s decision on the period of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>1.         Admissibility of Evidence</h2>
  <h2>            <i>i.          Standard of Review</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant impugns the trial judge’s evidentiary decisions, targeting his
    weighing of probative value and prejudice with respect to evidence relevant
    to motive—in particular, evidence of past discreditable conduct—as well as
    his threshold admission of hearsay under the principled exception. Before
    analyzing the appellant’s submissions, I will first consider the standard
    of review applicable to these findings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    standard of review is clearly established for trial determinations of whether
    the probative value of similar fact and past discreditable conduct evidence
    sufficiently exceeds its prejudicial risk. Appellate courts accord a high
    degree of deference to trial judges’ decisions in this area. In <i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>R.
    v. B. (C.R.) </span></i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 23 (S.C.C.),</span> <span style='"Times New Roman"'>Justice
    McLachlin (as she then was) explained that this deference arises “as </span>a
    function of the broader, more discretionary nature of the modern rule [of
    similar fact evidence] at the stage where the probative value of the evidence
    must be weighed against its prejudicial effect.” See also <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002),
    164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 153 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    principle has been repeatedly affirmed by this court: see e.g., <i>R. v.
    James</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 235 at para. 33; <i>R. v. Woodcock</i> (2003),
    177 C.C.C. (3d) 346 at para. 127; <i>R. v. H.(T.R.)</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C.
    (3d) 522 at para. 20; <i>R. v. B.(L.); R. v. G.(M.A.)</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C.
    (3d) 481 at para. 51. As Justice Doherty stated in <i>James </i>at para.
    33, “[a]ppellate courts will defer to the trial judge’s assessment of the
    comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence
    unless an appellant can demonstrate that the result of the trial judge’s
    analysis is unreasonable, or is undermined by a legal error or a misapprehension
    of material evidence” (citations omitted). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Curiously,
      the law is less clear with regard to the appropriate standard for reviewing
      a trial court’s determination of the threshold admissibility of hearsay
      statements introduced under the principled exception. In contrast to the
      substantial deference appellate courts accord to trial courts’ admissibility
      decisions concerning similar fact evidence, there exists a line of authority
      in this court, beginning with <i>R. v. Merz</i> (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d)
      259 at para. 49, that states that hearsay admissibility decisions are subject
      to review on a standard of correctness:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In reviewing a trial judge’s decision to admit evidence
    under the principled exception to the hearsay rule, this court, absent manifest
    error, must accept the findings of fact made by the trial judge on which
    the ruling is predicated. The court must, however, apply a correctness standard
    to the ultimate question of whether the trial judge properly applied the
    criteria relevant to the admissibility of the evidence to the facts as found
    by the trial judge: <i>R. v. Hawkins</i> [(1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at
    160 (S.C.C.)].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has since adopted this holding from <i>Merz </i>without further elaboration
    in several cases: see <i>R. v. Czibulka </i>(2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 at
    para. 27; <i>R. v. Khelawon </i>(2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at para. 19,
    appeal on unrelated issues dismissed in [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787; <i>R. v. Canizales </i>(2005),
    198 C.C.C. (3d) 101 at para. 7. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    would, however, draw attention to the recent decision of the Supreme Court
    in <i>R. v. Couture</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517. <span style='"Times New Roman"'>In <i>Couture </i>at
    para. 132, Justice Rothstein, dissenting, stated:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]t is my view that the trial judge did not reverse
    the onus and made a reasonable factual finding that [the hearsay] statements
    met threshold reliability. … As stated by the majority in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen,</i> the

    Justice Charron held on behalf of the majority in <i>Couture </i>that appellate
    interference was warranted in the case before her, she stated at para. 81
    that she agreed with Justice Rothstein on the principle of appellate deference
    to trial judges’ decisions on the admissibility of hearsay evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he trial judge is well placed to assess the extent
    to which the hearsay dangers are of concern in the particular case and whether
    they can be sufficiently overcome. Hence, the trial judge’s ruling on admissibility

    is, however, no need to resolve this issue at the present time. As I explain
    further below, the trial judge’s decision on threshold admissibility in this
    case does not exhibit reversible error even when subjected to review on a
    standard of correctness. As such, I would leave to another court the definitive
    resolution of the appropriate standard of review for trial decisions on the
    threshold admissibility of hearsay.</p>
  <h2><i>ii.         Admissibility Decisions Involving the Weighing of Probative
      Value Against Prejudicial Risk</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant attacks the trial judge’s decisions regarding various items of
    evidence whose probative value he found exceeded prejudicial risk. These
    items include: testimony by the victim’s children concerning an altercation
    that involved the appellant slapping the victim and concluded with the appellant
    engaging in a fistfight with his son when he intervened; testimony by the
    victim’s children, brother, and father of threats by the appellant against
    the victim; testimony by the victim’s daughter concerning a demeaning and
    threatening statement the appellant made against the victim; and testimony
    by the victim’s brother concerning a loan by the victim to the appellant
    and his brothers, which the victim wanted repaid. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the trial judge’s ruling and the contents of this evidence, I conclude
    that the appellant has failed to show any palpable or overriding error in
    the trial judge’s <i>voir dire </i>decision. The trial judge reasonably decided
    that all of this evidence was relevant to the appellant’s motive, and the
    appellant’s submissions do not provide me with any reason to doubt these
    findings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary
    to the appellant’s submissions, it is highly relevant to the issues of motive
    and intent that the appellant may have engaged in recent threats and other
    discreditable conduct that were specifically targeted against the victim,
    and that his animus toward the victim had been increasing during the time
    leading up to the killing. Such evidence of threatening or abusive behaviour
    by an accused against a victim possesses probative value precisely because
    it demonstrates that the accused possessed a specific tendency or intention
    to act against the victim. Although such evidence potentially causes the
    appellant prejudice due to the risk that the jury might use it to unfairly
    convict the appellant on the basis that he is a bad or frightening person <i>simpliciter</i>,
    as stated above, it is the trial judge who bears the principal responsibility
    in deciding whether the probative value of evidence outweighs its prejudicial
    risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also reasonably found that the testimony concerning the appellant’s
    debt to the victim was relevant to motive. The appellant’s assertion that
    this debt’s relatively low value restricts its probative value as an indicator
    of motive does not provide sufficient grounds for reversing the trial judge’s
    determination. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      trial judge’s thorough reasons in his <i>voir dire</i> decision indicate
      that he more than adequately considered and weighed the prejudicial risk
      against the probative value of each of the above-mentioned items of evidence
      relevant to motive. As there is no indication that the trial judge improperly
      exercised his discretion to admit the evidence that he did, I find that
      the appellant has failed to demonstrate that these decisions exhibit reversible
      error.</span></p>
  <h2><i>iii.       Threshold Admissibility of Ante-Mortem Hearsay Statements</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant challenges the trial judge’s <i>voir dire </i>decisions on the

    As I have stated, it is my view that the trial judge’s decision survives
    review on a standard of correctness.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ante-mortem statements the trial judge permitted the jury to consider consisted
    of statements the victim made to her relatives and a close friend. The content
    of the statements concerned the victim’s intent to leave her husband and
    her fear of the consequences; threats and abuse by the appellant against
    her; a threatening discussion with the appellant’s brother; and the victim’s
    discovery of a gun in the appellant’s car.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    discussion will consider, first, the appellant’s broad argument that the
    trial judge erred in his threshold reliability analysis because he overlooked
    potential motivations the victim possessed to fabricate or mislead; second,
    the various inconsistencies the appellant alleges in the evidence and the
    trial judge’s analysis; and, third, the admission of an item of double hearsay
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s primary ground of attack is based on the broad submission that
    the trial judge should have found all of these statements unreliable because
    they were made by the victim at a time when she was planning to leave her
    husband. As such, the victim had several possible motivations for fabricating
    stories of fear and abuse. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant submits that the victim may have wanted to create a record
    in contemplation of family law litigation, in particular for the purpose
    of winning custody of her children. Second, the appellant submits that the
    victim may have wanted to obtain moral and material support from her family
    for her impending departure from her husband. In support of these submissions,
    the appellant notes that the Crown’s evidence clearly establishes that the
    victim consulted with a lawyer in contemplation of family law proceedings,
    and that all of the witnesses to the ante-mortem statements believed that
    the victim had intended to leave the matrimonial home in the near future. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant bolsters his submission concerning the victim’s possible motivation
    to fabricate in contemplation of pending litigation by citing this court’s
    decision in <i>Czibulka</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 57, where it was said
    that “a statement made in contemplation of litigation is a classic reason
    to suspect that the statement was contrived.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not find this holding in <i>Czibulka</i> helpful to the appellant’s challenge.
    In <i>Czibulka</i>, when this court excluded a physician’s account of the
    deceased declarant’s display of bruises on her body and her claim that they
    were caused by her husband, the court found it particularly pertinent that
    the declarant’s statements included the remark that she was motivated to
    display her bruises to the physician “for the record”. After taking into
    account the physician’s account of the declarant’s upbeat demeanour, this
    court concluded that the trial judge should have considered the evidence
    to be unreliable. Furthermore, the declarant in <i>Czibulka</i> was actually
    engaged in a bitter custody dispute with the accused when she made the ante-mortem
    statements at issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    contrast, the content and circumstances of the ante-mortem statements in
    the present appeal do not present any overt indication that the victim was
    contemplating the creation of a record for litigation when she made these
    statements to her close friends and relatives. Unlike the victim in <i>Czibulka</i>,
    the victim in the present case may have formed an intention to leave her
    husband, but she was not actively engaged in legal proceedings. Although
    she had consulted a lawyer, actual litigation—nevermind the bitter custody
    dispute that formed the backdrop to <i>Czibulka</i>—was only a speculative
    possibility. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent that the appellant’s argument implies a general rule that ante-mortem
    hearsay statements uttered during the context of marital difficulties or
    imminent divorce proceedings are presumptively unreliable under the principled
    exception, I would decline the invitation to set down such a broad rule of
    presumptive exclusion. Moreover, the Supreme Court has recently clarified
    that the existence of a motive to lie is “but one factor to consider in the
    determining of threshold reliability”: <i>R. v. Blackman</i>, 2008 SCC 37
    at para. 42.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge examined the available corroborating evidence and the circumstances
    in which the statements were made, and found that the statements at issue
    were made in the context of everyday intimate conversations between close
    relatives and friends where there was no motive to fabricate. This court
    has signalled that the context of a “special” relationship can constitute
    an indicator of reliability, see <i>Czibulka</i> at para. 47, and I see no
    error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the statements possessed sufficient
    hallmarks of threshold reliability. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    similarly reject the appellant’s submission that the victim may have fabricated
    her statements to her father and brother because she wanted to obtain moral
    and material support from her family for her impending departure from her
    husband. Unlike the victim in <i>Czibulka</i>, who unsuccessfully made a
    request to live with her cousin before writing him a letter detailing the
    allegedly abusive nature of her marriage, there was no indication that the
    victim in this case had any need to fabricate stories of abuse to obtain
    support or shelter from her parents and brother. Indeed, the victim’s father
    and brother testified that they were well aware that the marriage was fraught
    with a significant history of abuse—some of which they had personally witnessed—and
    that they were negatively disposed toward the appellant. When viewed in this
    context, the appellant’s submissions on this point are, at best, speculative. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant adverts to several alleged indications of inconsistency in the
    hearsay evidence admitted by the trial judge. After examining the record,
    I find that none of these alleged indications demonstrates material discrepancies
    sufficient to undermine the reliability of this evidence when considered
    in light of the indicia of reliability found by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also specifically attacks the trial judge’s decision to admit the
    hearsay evidence of the victim’s friend Silvana Panetta concerning a conversation
    she had with the victim a year-and-a-half prior to the killing. During this
    conversation, the victim related her fear of the appellant and described
    several past incidents of abuse, including an account of an incident in which
    the appellant broke the victim’s nose while travelling in a car. The appellant
    observes that the trial judge excluded evidence given by the daughter and
    son of this same incident of abuse, and objects that the trial judge ruled
    arbitrarily in deciding to reject the children’s evidence yet admit Ms. Panetta’s
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument. The trial judge found the children’s evidence
    of this incident—which they had directly witnessed—to be reliable, but excluded
    it on the basis that accounts of abuse <i>simpliciter</i> that occurred several
    years prior to killing were more prejudicial than probative. The trial judge’s
    rejection of the children’s direct evidence of this incident as bearing insufficient
    probative value, however, in no way precluded him from finding Ms. Panetta’s
    hearsay evidence of this incident both (i) sufficiently reliable to permit
    threshold admissibility under the principled exception; and (ii) on balance
    more probative than prejudicial and therefore admissible. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    contrast to the children’s evidence, which merely related the facts of a
    past incident of abuse, the trial judge found that Ms. Panetta’s hearsay
    account of this incident was an integral part of a conversation that was
    sufficiently close in time to the killing and that it illuminated important
    aspects of the factual matrix surrounding the crime, including the victim’s
    state of the mind and the prevailing matrimonial environment. This conversation
    demonstrated the deceased’s fear of the appellant, which would reduce the
    likelihood that she would have provoked the appellant. Given the trial judge’s
    broad discretion in weighing probative value against prejudicial risk, this
    determination was not in error. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is one portion of the trial judge’s hearsay rulings that is potentially problematic.
    The victim’s daughter, Lisa, and son, Carlo, gave evidence of a telephone
    conversation between the victim and the appellant’s brother, Mike, which
    occurred two days prior to the killing. As with the other ante-mortem statements
    the trial judge admitted under the principled exception, the trial judge
    found the admission of these statements to be necessary because of the victim’s
    death, but made no mention of Mike’s availability for trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lisa
    testified that she was just outside the door of the room in which her mother
    made the telephone call, and that she heard her mother’s end of the conversation.
    She stated that her mother discussed the pizzeria and the loan to the appellant,
    and that the conversation devolved into arguing and yelling as it turned
    to topics such as the appellant’s past affairs and the victim’s intention
    to leave the appellant. Lisa tried to warn her mother away from saying “anything
    you’re not supposed to say”, and to convince her mother to end the conversation
    when she realized the direction it was taking. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mike’s
    availability to testify does not affect the necessity analysis with regard
    to Lisa’s testimony of what she heard of her mother’s end of the conversation.
    The victim’s death rendered the admissibility of these ante-mortem statements
    necessary and Mike’s situation with regard to these ante-mortem statements
    does not significantly differ from Lisa’s by virtue of his participation
    in the telephone conversation.’’ </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lisa
    also testified that her mother was very upset immediately after the conclusion
    of the telephone conversation. The victim explained to Lisa that she thought
    that Mike had delivered a death threat by warning her that “the way I fix
    my bed is the way I’m going to lie in it.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Carlo
    similarly testified that he spoke to his mother just after she ended the
    conversation, and that she appeared upset and angry. The only statement by
    Mike that Carlo remembers his mother reporting to him is similar to the statement
    reported by Lisa: “The bed that you fix is the bed you lie in and all those
    who follow.” Carlo likewise testified that his mother told him that she thought
    this was a death threat.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    and Carlo’s reports of what Mike said to the deceased, if adduced for their
    truth, was double hearsay. The principled exception making the deceased’s
    statements admissible did not make other hearsay statements admissible.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    I am satisfied that Mike’s statement was not adduced for its truth, but merely
    for the fact that it was said. The Crown did not rely on Mike’s threat, if
    that is what it was, as evidence that the appellant had threatened the deceased,
    but merely to show the effect on the deceased’s state of mind. </p>

    if I am wrong, the admission of this statement did not result in any substantial
    wrong or miscarriage of justice. There was abundant admissible evidence of
    threats and actual assaults by the appellant himself. When the record is
    viewed as a whole, the admission of Mike’s alleged threat was, in the circumstances,
    inconsequential. </p>

      victim’s close relationship with the witnesses, corroborating evidence
      concerning the circumstances of the marriage and various instances of abuse,
      and the personal and potentially embarrassing nature of some of the revelations.
      In the absence of any overt indications of unreliability, the trial judge

    some of the hearsay permitted into evidence was admitted to prove the truth
    of its contents, but other hearsay was admitted solely on the issue of consistency,
    Justice McLachlin (as she then was) stated, at para. 38, that the “usual
    rule”
    requires instructing the jury as to the permissible uses of this evidence.
    Similarly, the case of <i>R. v. Starr </i>(2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.),
    involved hearsay statements that were admitted under the “present intentions” exception.
    Justice Iacobucci therefore stated, at paras. 180–86, that without an exception
    for a second level of hearsay, it was impermissible to use such evidence
    to prove the intentions of anyone other than the declarant, and that the

    court has also held that with regard to hearsay evidence admitted for the
    purpose of proving the truth of its contents under the principled exception,
    the trial judge’s jury instructions must explain the increased risk that
    such statements may be unreliable, as well as the jury’s obligation to determine
    the reliability and weight it will attribute to such evidence: see <i>R.

    76 C.C.C. (3d) 522 at 527–29. In <i>Blackman</i>, Justice Cronk stated, at
    para. 85, that instructions concerning hearsay admitted under the principled
    exception are adequate so long as they make clear to the jury “the need to
    determine whether the [s]tatements were made and, if made, the nature of

    set out in <i>Blackman</i>. In other parts of the charge, the trial judge
    instructed the jury as to the relevance of some of the evidence—for example,
    to show that the appellant had a motive to kill his wife because he knew
    she was leaving him. In the circumstances, the directions, although not as
    comprehensive as they might have been, sufficiently alerted the jury as to
    the relevance of the evidence and the use to be made of it.</p>
  <h2><i>ii.         Absence of a Bad Character Caution</i></h2>

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury
    on the proper use of the abuse evidence in relation to the issues at trial.
    I take this to suggest that the trial judge should have provided a “bad character” caution
    with regard to this evidence of prior discreditable conduct. </p>

    consistent line of authority in this court states that no such caution is
    required for evidence of past threats or other bad conduct by the accused
    against the victim, if such evidence is admissible in relation to motive.
    This is because such evidence is admitted on the basis that someone who has
    threatened or acted against a specific victim in the past is more likely
    to have engaged in bad conduct against the same victim than someone who has
    not, and a jury is permitted to draw an adverse inference of guilt from such
    conduct. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    line of precedent began with <i>R. v. Jackson</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d)
    154, in which Justice Martin stated at pp. 168–69:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]here evidence of threats <i>against the victim</i> are
    admissible on the issue of motive, there is no requirement that the trial
    Judge should direct the jury that they are not to infer from the threats
    that the accused is a person who, from his criminal character or conduct,
    is likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged. Evidence
    of motive is a circumstance to be considered along with all the other circumstances.

      v. Merz</i>, <i>supra </i>at para. 59, Justice Doherty stated his agreement
      with the principle set down in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Jackson</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I agree with the view expressed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Jackson</i>. The evidence of the threats made by the appellant was evidence
    of motive which, in turn, constituted circumstantial evidence of identity
    and intent. I see no reason to warn the jury against using the evidence to
    infer propensity and hence to infer that the accused committed the crime
    when the more direct and powerful inference to be drawn from that evidence
    is that the accused had a motive to kill Ms. Murray. The trial judge properly
    instructed the jury as to how they could use evidence of motive. The limiting
    instruction normally given when evidence of prior bad acts by the accused
    is placed before the jury would make no sense in the context of evidence
    of motive. An instruction like that called for by the appellant could only
    serve to confuse the jury.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    principle was more recently reaffirmed by Justice Moldaver in <i>R. v. Krugel</i> (2000),
    143 C.C.C. (3d) 367 at paras. 84–92 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). The appellant has not provided any arguments or countervailing authority
    to contest the logic supporting this precedent, and I see no reason for doing
    so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present case, the only issues contested at trial concerned the appellant’s
    intent and the defence of provocation. The trial judge in his <i>voir dire</i> ruling
    specifically explained, with regard to every item of past discreditable conduct
    evidence that he admitted, that he was admitting it as relevant to motive.
    He similarly labelled all of this evidence as going to motive in his charge
    to the jury. </p>

      therefore conclude that there was no need for the trial judge to provide
      a bad character caution in the jury charge and he therefore did not err

      trial judge made this remark in the context of explaining that the jury
      had to consider all of the evidence presented in order to determine whether
      any item of hearsay admitted under the principled exception was ultimately
      reliable. In doing so, the trial judge summarized and contrasted the evidence
      of the appellant to that of the Crown’s witnesses—who, as noted above,
      were permitted to testify to the accused’s threatening character vis-a-vis
      the victim as evidence of motive—as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In essence, Mr. Pasqualino denies most, if not all,
    of those things that his wife said. <i>If you believe what the witnesses
    say the deceased said about him, you will likely have a picture of a pretty
    volatile man subjected to fits of temper and violence and perhaps you might
    even find that the man was somewhat scary. The accused, on the other hand,
    depicts himself as quite different than what these witnesses seem to be picturing
    him.</i> He describes himself as rather a calm person and an aggrieved person
    who mostly tried to keep the peace in the house, a person who wanted to wish
    his son on that day a happy birthday but was not given an opportunity to
    do so.</p>

    my view, the trial judge gave a balanced overview of the evidence presented
    by both sides and did not cause prejudice to the appellant by using the word “scary” for
    the purpose of contrasting the totality of the admissible evidence given
    by the Crown witnesses with the evidence given by the appellant.</p>

  <h2>3.   Period of Parole Ineligibility</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s imposition of a period of parole
    ineligibility of 13 years was harsh and excessive. In support of this submission,
    the appellant points to his lack of criminal record, the appellant’s remorse,
    and the deemed jury recommendation of 10 years. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is well-established that trial judges possess a broad discretion to fashion,
    within the sentencing range delineated by prior cases arising under similar
    contexts, sentences they reasonably determine to be fit for the circumstances
    of the individual offenders and offences that appear before them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the trial judge’s sentencing reasons, I conclude that there is
    no reason to question the fitness of the sentence he has fashioned. In particular,
    with regard to the force of the deemed recommendation on parole ineligibility,
    this court has stated that “the jury’s recommendation must be considered
    in fixing the appropriate period”, yet “the jury’s recommendation need not
    be slavishly followed”: <i>R. v. McKnight</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41
    at para. 55. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s sentencing judgment indicated that he accurately identified
    the sentence range for a second-degree murder in the domestic context by
    an offender with no criminal record as encompassing a period of parole ineligibility
    of 10–14 years. The trial judge considered the deemed jury recommendation,
    as well as the other mitigating factors the appellant cites. He also took
    into account the victim impact statements and aggravating factors such as
    the history of abuse, but properly rejected the notion that it was the court’s
    role to mete out vengeance. The trial judge then gave cogent reasons as to
    why he thought the circumstances justified a period of parole ineligibility
    in excess of the deemed jury recommendation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the final analysis, it was amply within the trial judge’s discretion to decide,
    despite the deemed jury recommendation and the appellant’s remorse and absence
    of prior criminal convictions, that a sentence of 13 years parole ineligibility
    was required to adequately deter and denounce a spousal murder committed
    by a husband who was “very abusive to his spouse … [and who] abused his position
    of trust toward her and their children.”</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I can discern no reversible error in the trial judge’s conduct of the proceedings,
    I would dismiss both the conviction appeal and the appeal from the period
    of parole ineligibility.</p>
