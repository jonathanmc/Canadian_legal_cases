  <h4>A.        INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    broad question on this appeal is whether the appellants guilty pleas to
    the sexual abuse of his young son should be set aside because a mental disorder
    undermined the voluntariness of those pleas.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two specific issues raised by the parties are: first, what is the proper
    test for assessing whether a mental disorder affects the voluntariness of
    a guilty plea; and second, applying that test, has the appellant shown that
    his pleas were driven by a major depressive disorder that undermined the
    voluntariness of those pleas.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.        BACKGROUND</h4>
  <h3>(a)       The guilty pleas (October 2002)</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Mr. W., represented himself at the guilty plea hearing.  He pleaded
    guilty to sexually assaulting and sexually interfering with his son between
    January 1996 and June 1999, when his son was between 15 months and four and
    a half years old.  He admitted penetrating his sons anus with his fingers
    and penis, and forcing his son to perform fellatio.  The allegations to which
    the appellant pleaded came to light when his son disclosed the abuse to his
    adoptive parents and later gave a videotaped statement to the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appellant said he wanted to plead guilty, the trial judge conducted the
    inquiry contemplated by s. 606(1.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He asked
    the appellant whether his plea was voluntary, his own decision entirely,
    whether he understood that the consequences of a guilty plea could be very
    severe, and whether he understood that a trial judge was not bound by any
    proposed sentence.  To all these questions, the appellant replied yes, he
    understood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case was then adjourned for sentencing.  The trial judge ordered a pre-sentence
    report.  Before adjourning, the trial judge encouraged the appellant to get
    a lawyer.  </p>
  <h3>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing hearing (January 2003)</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did retain a lawyer, Mr. Ianni, to represent him at the sentencing
    hearing.  At the beginning of the hearing, however, Mr. Ianni asked to be
    removed from the record.  He told the trial judge that the appellant refused
    to accept his advice.  He said that as an officer of the court, I cannot,
    in all good conscience, continue to represent Mr. W..  The trial judge removed
    Mr. Ianni from the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then offered the appellant the opportunity to get another lawyer,
    including duty counsel who was in court, saying that the appellant may very
    well benefit from the presence of qualified counsel.  The appellant refused
    these offers.  He said that he was ready to proceed. </p>
  <h3>(i)        The appellants criminal record</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentencing hearing the Crown filed the appellants criminal record and
    supporting documents.  The appellant had three sets of previous convictions.  In
    1988, he was convicted of one count of sexual assault for which he received
    a sentence of six months imprisonment followed by two years of probation.  He
    had rubbed the genital area of a 14 year-old boy while the boy stood on a
    ladder, after the appellant told him to look into an attic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1991, the appellant was convicted of one count of gross indecency, one count
    of invitation to sexual touching, four counts of sexual exploitation and
    one count of sexual interference for which he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment
    followed by three years probation, concurrent on each count (the appellant
    also served one year pre-trial custody).  The appellant had pleaded guilty
    to allegations that at various times between 1972 and 1990 he had hired six
    boys, ages 10 to 16 years old, to perform odd jobs, and that once the jobs
    were finished he offered each of the boys extra money in exchange for a sexual
    encounter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2000, the appellant was convicted on one count of uttering a threat and sentenced
    to 18 months probation.  After an incident with his wife, he had threatened
    a 13-year-old girl in a park.</p>
  <h3>(ii)      The pre-sentence report (November 2002)</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also filed a pre-sentence report that the trial judge had ordered.  The
    reports author reviewed the appellants background.  The appellant was 46
    years old at the time of sentencing.  He was married in 1994 and shortly
    after, his son was born.  His wife never bonded with the child; from the
    beginning, primarily it was the appellant who cared for his son.  As the
    Crown points out in its factum, the pre-sentence report shows that the appellant
    was ill-equipped for this role.  He suffered from permanent injuries as a
    result of a bad car accident in the late 1970s; his mental health was fragile
    at best; he had limited financial means to provide for his family; and he
    suffers from a sexual paraphilia, an attraction to young teenage boys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, the appellants marriage fell apart and the Childrens Aid Society
    apprehended his son.  The appellant became angry, bitter and depressed.  He
    could no longer cope.  He frequently threatened suicide.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the summer of 2000 he was living on the street.  He seemed unwilling to help
    himself: he refused to see a lawyer, and he refused to see a psychiatrist
    or get any other medical help.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pre-sentence report also described the appellants
    present situation, that is his situation at the time of sentencing.  He was
    deeply depressed and hopeless about his present situation and held no hope
    for his future.  He said that he could not handle life in the community
    anymore and only sees jail in his future.  He wanted to be declared a
    dangerous offender so that he could go to jail for the rest of his life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    author of the pre-sentence report concluded that because the appellant had
    no desire to be treated or accept help from an agency, he remained a risk
    to the community.  In the authors opinion, the appellant would benefit
    from intensive long-term therapy to address his depression, self esteem,
    suicidal ideations and sexual offending behaviour. </p>
  <h3><span>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence of Mary Jackson</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary
    Jackson was the program coordinator and community chaplain for the Bridge
    Program.  Since 1992 the appellant had actively participated in that program.  Ms.
    Jackson was in court the day the appellant was sentenced and asked to speak
    on his behalf.  The trial judge heard her statement, even though the appellant
    said that it was unnecessary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Jackson asked that the court consider that he desperately needs psychiatric
    and physical care.  In her opinion he doesnt want his son to have to be
    interviewed any further.  Thats why he pled guilty.</p>
  <h3><span>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crowns position on sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown asked for the maximum sentence, 10 years, less one years credit for
    the five months the appellant spent in pre-trial custody, or a total sentence
    of nine years imprisonment.</p>
  <h3><span>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants position on sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not object to any of the documents the Crown filed on sentencing.  He
    declined the trial judges offer of time to collect his thoughts before addressing
    the court; instead he said he agreed with the Crowns submission and asked
    for the maximum sentence without parole:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thank you, You Honour.  I agree with Mr. Nadel
    has said.  Theres a history.  Theres victims, and the whole thing has just
    gotten completely out of hand.  There was a time when societys got to hear
    stop, and its the courts responsibility, in my opinion, to say stop.  I
    have to show dismay because when I first started through the bail hearings
    I was given the intention that a deal was going to be applied for.  Im disappointed
    that the Crown has withdrawn that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I personally feel that we should be looking at
    the maximum, ten years, no consideration, the same consideration Ive given
    my victims, and that should be ten years per count consecutive, no parole.  Lets
    protect society at least for a little while.  Thank you.</p>
  <h3><span>(vi)<span

    voluntariness of a guilty plea.  I turn now to these issues.</p>
  <h3>C.        Analysis</h3>
  <h3>(a)       What is the appropriate test for determining whether mental disorder
    affects the voluntariness of a guilty plea?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judgment of Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. T. (R.)</i> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 514
    (C.A.), is the principal decision of this court on what an appellant must
    show to set aside a guilty plea on the ground that it is invalid.  A guilty
    plea is valid if it is voluntary, informed and unequivocal; conversely a
    plea that is either not voluntary, not informed, or not unequivocal is invalid
    and may be set aside on appeal.  An appellant has the onus of showing invalidity
    on a balance of probability: see p. 519.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue on this appeal is whether the appellants depression amounted to a
    mental disorder that affected the voluntariness of his guilty plea.  In <i>T.
    (R.)</i> Doherty J.A. said that [a] voluntary plea refers to the conscious
    volitional decision of the accused to plead guilty for reasons which he or
    she regards as appropriate: see p. 520.  Doherty J.A. also recognized that
    mental disorder is one factor that may impair the voluntariness of a plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    sides, of course, accept these principles from <i>T. (R.)</i>.  However,
    they disagree on what standard should be applied when an appellant relies
    on mental disorder to invalidate a plea because of involuntariness.  The
    Crown contends that we should apply the same standard we use to determine
    an accuseds fitness to stand trial: the limited cognitive capacity standard.  That
    standard requires only that the court be satisfied an accused understands
    the process, can communicate with counsel and can make an active or conscious
    choice.  Whether the accuseds choice is wise, rational or in the accuseds
    best interest forms no part of the limited cognitive capacity standard.  See <i>R.
    v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Taylor</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 551 at 563-67 (Ont.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, on the other hand, contends that we should adopt a higher standard
    of mental competency.  The limited cognitive capacity standard advocated
    by the Crown, he argues, may produce miscarriages of justice.  He relies
    on an article by Schneider and Bloom, R. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Taylor: A Decision Not in the Best Interests of Some Mentally Ill Accused (1995)
    38 Crim. L.Q. 183, in which the authors suggest that an accused who irrationally
    seeks self punishment because of severe depression may be mentally unfit.  The
    appellant says that his guilty pleas were involuntary because his conduct
    was irrational, hopeless and helpless and because he felt there was no
    other option than to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Crowns position is correct for two main reasons: first, consistency
    in the standard for mental competency; second, respect for an accuseds liberty
    interest.  Moreover, the limited cognitive capacity standard is compatible
    with the voluntariness test in <i>T. (R.)</i>.</p>
  <h3>(i)        Consistency</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts
    apply the limited cognitive capacity standard to determine an accuseds fitness
    to stand trial, as well as to assess the voluntariness of an accuseds decision
    whether to exercise the right to silence and the right to counsel.  Applying
    this same test to the voluntariness of a guilty plea would achieve a desirable
    degree of uniformity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i>, this court accepted the limited cognitive capacity standard
    for fitness to stand trial.  In <i>R. v. Whittle</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d)
    11 at 25-26 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that standard
    for fitness.   However, <i>Whittles</i> significance goes beyond its affirmation
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i><i>s</i> fitness standard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Whittle, who suffered from schizophrenia, gave statements to the police about
    crimes he committed, including a murder.  In determining whether his statements
    were voluntary, the court considered whether he was capable of exercising
    his right to counsel and his right to silence.  In concluding that he was
    capable of doing so, and therefore that his statements were voluntary, Sopinka
    J. writing for the court made two points relevant to this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Sopinka J. said that the limited cognitive capacity standard  the ability
    to understand the process and make an active choice
    or, in other words, a conscious choice  applied to the voluntariness of
    the statements: see pp. 29-31.  Second, he stressed the desirability of a
    consistent mental competency standard for all decisions that an accused makes
    before and during the criminal trial  including the decision whether to
    exercise the right to silence, the decision whether to exercise the right
    to counsel, the decision whether to testify and the decision how to plead:
    see p. 30.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In assessing the requisite degree of mental competence
    required for the exercise of [the right to counsel], it should be observed
    that the rights of an accused in the criminal process should as far as possible
    be harmonized.  In respect of each of the rights under discussion, the accused
    is entitled to make a choice.  Unless there is some good reason inherent
    in the right, it makes little sense to differentiate as to the requisite
    mental state to make that choice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    it is hard to justify a higher standard of mental competency for the decision
    to plead guilty than for other decisions an accused must make during the
    criminal process.  An accuseds decision to plead guilty is obviously an
    important decision.  But so too is an accuseds decision to retain a lawyer
    or to give evidence.  Further, it would be incongruous to find an accused
    mentally competent to stand trial, yet unfit to enter a valid plea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    limited cognitive capacity standard is also compatible with the test in <i>T.
    (R.)</i> for determining the voluntariness of a guilty plea.  The limited
    cognitive capacity standard requires an ability to understand the process
    and make an active or conscious choice.  The standard in <i>T. (R.)</i> requires the
    conscious volitional decision of the accused to plead guilty for reasons
    which he or she regards as appropriate: see p. 520.  In substance, these
    standards are the same.  Both standards require that an accused be capable
    of making a decision.  Both standards are subjective: they reject the notion
    that the accuseds decision must be rational or objectively in the accuseds
    best interests.  </p>
  <h3>(ii)      The liberty interest of an accused</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    leads to the second reason why I agree with the Crowns position.  It respects
    the accuseds liberty interest, specifically the right to conduct ones own
    defence, which is guaranteed by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Beginning with
    the Chief Justice Lamers majority judgment in <i>R. v. Swain</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 505 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada has said
    that the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 contemplate an accusatorial
    and adversarial system of criminal justice founded on respect of the autonomy
    and dignity of human beings.  Thus, the principles of fundamental justice
    must also require that an accused person have the right to control his or
    her own defence.  Once an accused person had been found fit to stand trial,
    that accused
    must be considered capable of conducting his or her own defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    higher standard of mental competency that would require accuseds to have
    the capacity to make rational decisions and act in their own best interests
    is at odds with the notion of individual autonomy referred to in <i>Swain</i>.  In
    a sense it would smack of paternalism, inviting the court to decide whether
    accuseds have made wise choices.  This standard underlies the approach of
    Schneider and Bloom on which the appellant relies, but was rejected by this
    court in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i>.  Writing for the court at p. 567, Lacourcière J.A. said adopting
    a high threshold to fitness, including a best interests
    component, derogates from the fundamental principal that an accused is entitled
    to choose his own defence and to present it as he chooses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    in my view, the evidentiary record on this appeal must be assessed against
    the limited cognitive capacity standard.  To succeed on this appeal, the
    appellant must show that his depression deprived him of the capacity to make
    an active or conscious choice whether to plead guilty, or the capacity to
    make a conscious volitional decision  to plead guilty  for reasons which
    he  regards as appropriate: see <i>T. (R.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 520.  He
    cannot succeed if he can merely show that his decision to plead guilty was
    not rational or in his best interests, or even that he was incapable of making
    a decision that was rational or in his best interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants fitness to stand trial and the voluntariness of his decisions
    to refuse the assistance of counsel and plead guilty were not raised at trial.  That
    they were not raised, I do not regard as fatal to the appellants appeal.  In
    saying that, I intend no criticism of the trial judge.  He conducted the
    plea and sentencing proceedings entirely appropriately.  However, he did
    not have the benefit of the fresh evidence now before this court and on which
    the appellant relies.  I will now consider that evidence.  </p>
  <h3>(b)       Has the appellant shown that his pleas were not voluntary?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    answer to this question turns largely on our assessment of the expert evidence.  Relying
    on Dr. McMasters opinion, the appellant contends that at the time of his
    pleas and sentencing he suffered from a major depressive disorder that affected
    the voluntariness of his pleas.  Relying on Dr. Woodsides opinion, the Crown
    contends either the appellant did not suffer from a major depressive disorder,
    or that if he did suffer from a major depressive disorder, that disorder
    was moderate and non-psychotic.  In either case, the Crown says, the voluntariness
    of his pleas was not impaired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Woodside defined major depressive disorder as: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] major mental illness that tends to have its
    onset in the third or fourth decade of life.  It is characterized by symptoms
    of a major depressive episode, which usually develops over days to weeks
    and lasts, untreated, typically six months or longer.  During a major depressive
    episode, an individual will feel sad and blue, will lose interest in their
    usual pursuits, will give evidence of disturbance of sleep and appetite,
    will have impaired concentration, will tend to feel hopeless, helpless and
    worthless, and may experience suicidal ideation.  As well, individuals may
    suffer from symptoms of psychosis during a major depressive episode.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Dr. McMaster did not disagree with
    this definition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    experts acknowledged that a major depressive disorder could potentially affect
    a persons ability to make a conscious volitional decision.  However, the
    experts disagreed on whether the appellant had a major depressive disorder,
    or at least one that undermined the voluntariness of his pleas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    expert examined or even interviewed the appellant during the relevant time  October
    2002 to January 2003.  Both interviewed him two to three years later, when
    he was not suffering from depression.  Therefore, in assessing the appellant
    and coming to their opinions on his mental competence at the relevant time,
    the experts had to rely on the following: </p>

    received this amount from federal and provincial social programs; when a
    Revenue Canada agent told him that his request could not be accommodated,

    of this evidence shows that the appellants conduct from just before the
    plea proceeding through the sentencing proceeding was highly unusual.  However,
    I am not satisfied that the appellant has shown his pleas were not voluntary.  I
    say that for these reasons.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>(i)        Dr. Woodsides evidence preferred</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    balance, I prefer the opinion of Dr. Woodside to that of Dr. McMaster.  Dr.
    Woodsides opinion (including both his report and testimony on cross-examination)
    is more thorough, better organized and, especially, more cogent than Dr.
    McMasters because he ties his analysis closely to the available evidence.  Dr.
    McMasters opinion tends to be conclusory, somewhat disorganized, and less
    cogent because it is not as well anchored in the evidence.  And if Dr. Woodsides
    evidence is accepted, the appellants appeal must fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    Dr. McMaster, Dr. Woodside provides guidance on the circumstances in which
    a major depressive disorder is more likely to impair the voluntariness of
    a guilty plea.  In his view, it is likely to do so only where either it is
    a psychotic form of depression, characterized, for example, by hallucinations
    or delusions, or it is a very severe form of depression.  The appellant did
    not suffer from a psychotic form of depression.  We have no evidence that
    he was delusional or hallucinating when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced.  And
    in Dr. Woodsides opinion, if he did suffer from a major depressive disorder,
    it was of no more than moderate severity.  Dr. Woodside therefore concluded
    that the appellants mental state did not affect the voluntariness of his
    pleas.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Woodside also addressed the other evidence the appellant relies on to support
    his claim that his pleas were not voluntary.  For example, he considered
    the appellants own statement about his mental health.  In Dr. Woodsides
    opinion the appellants self report only weakly supports his claim that
    he was suffering from a major depressive disorder; rather, in the doctors
    view, his conduct is more likely explained by a personality disorder and
    his long-standing difficulties in coping with interpersonal problems and
    stress.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in Dr. Woodsides opinion, the appellants behaviour at the plea and sentencing
    hearings points more likely to a kind of childish self-pitying all or nothing thinking,
    not a depressive disorder.  Also, the Revenue Canada incident, though unusual,
    cannot by itself support a finding of a major depressive disorder at least
    without knowing more about its context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Dr. Woodside considered the appellants refusal to accept legal assistance
    or medical treatment around the relevant period.  Admittedly that conduct
    was unusual and may be viewed as bolstering the appellants argument that
    he had given up hope and was acting out a desire for punishment.  However,
    neither Dr. Woodside nor even Dr. McMaster pointed to a tight link between
    these kinds of refusals and a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder.  Dr.
    Woodside was certainly alive to the appellants tendency to refuse help,
    yet he still did not think the appellant was suffering from a major depressive
    disorder.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>(ii)      Dr. McMasters evidence does not support the appellants claim</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    were I to accept Dr. McMasters evidence, overall I do not think that it
    is sufficient to sustain the appellants claim.  In his initial report, Dr.
    McMaster wrote:
    It would appear that [the appellant] was fit from a limited capacity threshold
    at the time of his plea and sentencing.  On my reading of <i>Whittle</i>,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    Dr. McMasters opinion that the appellants pleas were not voluntary is premised
    on a standard rejected by this court in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i> and by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Whittle</i>.  In both
    in his initial and later report, Dr. McMaster concluded that Mr. W.s decisions
    at the time of his plea and sentencing were influenced significantly by a
    major mental disorder (major depressive disorder), such that he did not have
    the ability to make a rational choice.  Whether the appellant was able to
    make a rational choice is not the relevant test; rather the test is whether
    the appellant had the capacity to make an active or conscious choice for
    reasons he considered appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination, Dr. McMaster seemed to acknowledge that the appellant
    did have the capacity to make an active or conscious choice.  Asked on cross-examination
    what he meant when he wrote the appellant lacked the ability to make a rational
    choice, he testified that the appellant obviously knew what he was doing,
    he was putting in a guilty plea.  He knew what would happen when he put in
    a guilty plea.  But he had this disorder that prevented him from weighing
    the different options and coming up with a conclusion based on a weighing
    of options.  There was only one option.  By giving this testimony, Dr. McMaster
    seemed to accept that the appellant knew that he had options but did not
    consider any choice but a guilty plea because that is the choice he thought
    he had to make.  In Dr. McMasters opinion, the appellants belief that a
    guilty plea was his only option undermines the voluntariness of those pleas.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law, however, does not require that an accused be able to engage in a careful,
    reasoned weighing of options.  The appellants conviction that he had only
    one option may reflect a realistic assessment of his actions, an expression
    of remorse, or a wish to spare his son from being further interviewed or
    having to testify in court.  Conscious singlemindedness does not render a
    decision involuntary.  Moreover, as Dr. Woodside points out, a desire to
    punish oneself for wrongdoing  even an irrational desire to do so   does
    not necessarily reflect the presence of a mental illness.  </p>
  <h3><span>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Previous
    psychiatric assessments of the appellant did not diagnose a major depressive
    disorder</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctors who saw the appellant before his plea did not diagnose a major depressive
    disorder or treat for it.  To the extent that they treated the appellant,
    they treated him for a personality dysfunction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Eppel, a psychiatrist, saw the appellant in early 2000 after his marriage
    had ended, his son had been apprehended and he had attempted suicide.  Dr.
    Eppel did not report that the appellant suffered from a major depressive
    disorder, and did not prescribe anti-depressant medication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hucker, a psychiatrist, saw the appellant in 2000 to assess him for a paraphilia.  Dr.
    Hucker took a thorough history and noted the numerous stressors in the appellants
    life.  But he gave no indication that the appellant suffered from a depressive
    disorder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was also briefly assessed at the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre
    just before his plea.  Although the assessment describes the appellant as depressed,
    it gives no indication of the severity of the depression and does not state
    that he was suffering from major depressive disorder.  Further, a later assessment
    at Hamilton-Wentworth diagnosed the appellant with affective disorder and
    personality disorder, not depression.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    during the 18 months that the appellant spent at the Regional Treatment Centre
    following his sentencing, none of the doctors or nurses who attended to him
    diagnosed him with major depressive disorder.  They viewed his difficulties
    as primarily caused by a personality disorder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from Dr. McMaster, the one health practitioner who noted that the appellant
    suffered from a major depressive disorder was Steve Losztyn, a psychologist
    at Warkworth.  Dr. Losztyn saw the appellant in April and June 2003 and again
    in February 2005, over two years after he had been sentenced and after he
    had returned from a lengthy stay at the Regional Treatment Centre.  In his
    2005 report, Dr. Losztyn noted that the appellants admission to RTC was
    precipitated by severe signs and symptoms commensurate with a Major Depressive
    Disorder, including the presence of auditory hallucinations and chronic suicidal
    ideation.  However, Dr. Losztyns 2003 reports, although they refer to the
    appellant as depressed, do not use the term major depressive disorder,
    and his April 2003 report notes that he did not see any signs of imminent
    self-harm. Further, Dr. Losztyns April 2003 report appears to conflict with
    the discharge note of Dr. Oliver, a psychiatrist at RTC, who saw no evidence
    that the appellant suffered from a major depressive disorder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Losztyn also found that the appellant experienced hallucinations.  Even if
    we accept that finding, however, it does not lead to the conclusion that
    the appellants guilty pleas were involuntary.  Admittedly, Dr. Woodsides
    report states that delusions or hallucinations might interfere with a persons
    ability to make a conscious, volitional choice.  But the hallucinations Dr.
    Losztyn refers to allegedly took place several months after the appellant
    entered his pleas, while the appellant was at the Warkworth Institution in
    April and May 2003.  As I said earlier, there is no evidence on the record
    that the appellant experienced delusions or hallucinations during the period
    of the plea and sentencing proceedings.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>(iv)      Some of the appellants conduct demonstrated that he was not
    suffering from a major depressive disorder</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balanced
    against the appellants highly unusual behaviour was conduct tending to show
    that he was not suffering from a major depression.  For example, at the plea
    and sentencing hearings, the appellant could point to specific sections of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, advance legal arguments, and ask for protection
    for the identity of victims.  Though claiming to be deeply depressed, he
    continued to do volunteer work at an information agency from 1999 to 2002.  In
    2002 he edited a monthly newspaper.  And while in jail following his arrest,
    he reported sleeping well and enjoying socializing with fellow inmates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    when the appellant arrived at the Regional Treatment Centre, he claimed that
    his depression disappeared overnight without any treatment or medication.  Diagnostic
    testing of the appellant at the Centre suggests that he overstated his symptoms.  When
    eventually he was briefly treated with an anti-depressant medication he apparently
    improved after the medication was discontinued, a seemingly atypical response
    for one suffering from a severe depression.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I conclude that the appellant has failed to show his pleas
    were not voluntary.</p>
