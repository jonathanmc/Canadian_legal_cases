    early 2003, the complainant, K.F., began spending weekends at B.A.’s home
    with her friend, B.M. Both girls were twelve years old at the time. B.A.,
    who was in his mid-fifties, was a close friend of B.M.’s mother, E.M. He
    had known B.M. from birth and over time had assumed a parental role. B.M.
    stayed at B.A.’s home on most weekends because her mother was at work. In
    January 2003, B.M. asked B.A. if the complainant could join her in staying
    at his home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    B.A. obtained permission from the complainant’s mother, the complainant began
    regularly spending weekends at B.A.’s home. B.A., who lived on a pension,
    paid the two girls for doing chores and getting good grades. He also took
    them out to restaurants and by his own reckoning may have spent as much as
    $800 to $1000 on clothes for each girl in 2003 and 2004, including sixty
    pairs of underwear for the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s pattern of regular weekend visits to B.A.’s home continued
    until the summer of 2003 and then resumed in the fall of 2003 when the girls
    started grade eight. In November 2003, the complainant accompanied B.A. and
    B.M. on a trip to
    <st2:place w:st="on">
      <st2:City w:st="on">Toronto</st2:City>
    </st2:place>
    . Around the end of May or the beginning of June 2004, the complainant spent
    between five and fourteen days at B.A.’s home after her family was evicted
    from the farm where they were living. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the complainant and B.A. got into a fight in June 2004 and did not see each
    other again until November 2004, when the complainant accompanied B.A. and
    B.M. on a second trip to
    <st2:place w:st="on">
      <st2:City
 w:st="on">Toronto</st2:City>
    </st2:place>
    . There was no dispute at trial that B.A. occupied the same room as the two
    girls during that trip. B.A. testified that following that trip, he told
    the complainant she was no longer welcome at his home. </p>

    complainant gave a videotaped statement to the police on December 15, 2004,
    which was admitted at trial under s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. She
    gave a second statement to the police a week later on December 22, 2004.
    In her first statement on December 15, the complainant said that B.A. began
    abusing her following “a very weird discussion about [what] age you have
    sex at and stuff like that.” In cross-examination at trial, she said that
    B.A. first did something sexually inappropriate to her sometime before March
    15, 2003. </p>

    to one witness, C.D., the complainant told her about the abuse during the
    summer of 2004, but asked C.D. not to tell anyone. The two discussed the
    abuse again in October 2004 after C.D. brought it up. The complainant also
    disclosed to her friend A.H. sometime in the fall of 2004. At the complainant’s
    request, A.H. told a former teacher, M.E.G., who in turn contacted a child
    welfare agency. During the fall of 2004, the complainant also disclosed to
    her cousin, M.K., and to another friend, M.F., while the three were outside

    B.M. and E.M. all testified for the defence. B.A. said he was 58 years old,
    divorced and had no criminal record. He was not working because of a disability
    arising from army injuries. He testified that he never physically or sexually
    abused either of the girls.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.M.
    testified that B.M. never expressed any reservations about spending time
    with B.A. and never had any injuries, other than once when she hurt herself
    sliding down a tree. In addition, she said that B.M.’s behaviour improved
    after she started spending weekends with B.A.</p>

'><b><span lang=EN-GB>iv</span>) The trial judge’s reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in his reasons, the trial judge identified the contradictory evidence of
    the complainant and B.M. as “[a] unique and troubling feature of this case.” However,
    he said he was “convinced [B.M.’s] interest in [B.A.’s] acquittal, renders
    her evidence suspect”, referring to B.M.’s hopes that her mother and B.A.
    would marry, as well as her fears about testifying.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    describing how the complainant began spending time at B.A.’s home and some
    difficulties in her life, the trial judge set out his conclusions about her
    evidence. He found the complainant’s “statement evidence and the core of
    her evidence at trial entirely credible.” In addition, he said that “[a]lthough
    she was cross-examined skillfully and at length, the essential elements of
    the offences are made out in her evidence, beyond reasonable doubt.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    stating these conclusions, the trial judge indicated that he had carefully
    considered the evidence of B.A. and B.M. and the circumstances of the complainant’s
    disclosures. He said that although he recognized that he could not use “prior
    consistent statements of a complainant to determine whether her sworn testimony
    is credible … her demeanor and the circumstances and consistency of her communicating
    what she said was happening to her, are properly the subject of observation
    in the search for truth.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then observed that one such circumstance was that the police
    interview resulted from a report to child protection authorities by M.E.G.,
    a teacher who taught the girls in grade seven from mid-April 2004 to the
    end of the school year. He noted that M.E.G. had observed the complainant
    crying on the floor at school on two occasions; that M.E.G. felt the complainant’s
    knowledge of sexual matters was more advanced than normal; and that M.E.G.
    had sensed the complainant was resentful of B.A. The trial judge noted that
    M.E.G. called child protection authorities based on information she received
    from A.H., who was the complainant’s friend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    describing the complainant’s testimony that the abuse began with B.A. rubbing
    lotion on her after forcing her to shower and then progressed to fingering
    and touching her vagina, the trial judge stated that he believed her evidence
    on that point and that it was sufficient to support a conviction for sexual
    assault. In so concluding, he noted that B.M.’s evidence that B.A. insisted
    the girls shower every night supported the complainant’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then referred to the complainant’s disclosures to C.D., M.K.
    and M.F. He described four features of her disclosure to M.K. and M.F.: i)
    being hit with a fly swatter while being quizzed; ii) being tied in the basement
    and struck with a fly swatter while strung up to the ceiling; iii) being
    made to “do stuff” to B.A., which the trial judge interpreted as referring
    to acts of masturbation and fellatio; and iv) being forced into the shower
    when she did not want to go. The trial judge stated, “The consistency helps
    me conclude she was truthful, and I prefer her evidence to that of B.A. and
    B.M.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge reviewed the aspects of the complainant’s evidence that supported
    findings of guilt with respect to the remaining counts on the indictment.
    In relation to the unlawful confinement charge, the trial judge concluded
    that a green bathrobe tie found by police in B.A.’s home was the tie the
    complainant said B.A. used to tie her to the basement ceiling.</p>

    acknowledged in oral argument that it was open to the trial judge to accept
    C.D.’s evidence that the complainant disclosed the abuse to C.D. during the
    summer of 2004 and to use that finding to rebut the suggestion that the complainant
    fabricated her allegations because B.A. told her she was no longer welcome
    at his home after the November 2004 trip to Toronto. B.A. also acknowledged
    that it was open to the trial judge to use M.F.’s evidence that the complainant
    told M.F. and M.K. that B.A. made her  “do stuff” to him to rebut the suggestion
    that the complainant fabricated her allegations of masturbation and fellatio
    during the second videotaped statement to the police on December 22, 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    B.A. submits that the trial judge was not entitled to use the remaining details
    of the complainant’s prior statements to M.K. and M.F. for other impermissible
    purposes. Moreover, he contends that the following portion of the trial judge’s
    reasons demonstrates that he used the complainant’s prior statements to M.K.
    and M.F. to improperly self-corroborate her testimony:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It was after the start of
    school, in her grade nine year, that she told other friends, outside the
    school, in an area where some of them went to smoke. Her cousin [M.K.] testified
    to four features of the disclosure [the complainant] made to her and [M.F.]
    She told of being struck with a flyswatter for failing to know the correct
    answers when being quizzed by [B.A.]. She told of being tied in the basement
    of his house and struck with a flyswatter, while strung up to the ceiling.
    She said, he made her “do stuff” to him, which I take to refer to the acts
    she described in her evidence, including, masturbating him and fellating
    him and she said, “he forced her into the shower when she did not want to
    go.” <i>These are consistent with [the complainant’s] statement taken by
    the police and with her trial evidence. The consistency helps me to conclude
    that she was truthful</i>, and I prefer her evidence to that of [B.A.] and
    [B.M.]. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept B.A.’s submissions. It was B.A.’s overall position at trial
    that the complainant’s evidence was a product of recent concoction. In that
    context, defence counsel at trial mounted a scathing attack on the complainant’s
    credibility by cross-examining her on numerous inconsistencies in detail
    between her evidence at trial, her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, and
    her two prior statements to the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    specific element of this attack related to the complainant’s claim in her
    second statement to the police that she performed oral sex on B.A. and stimulated
    him manually, and her failure to mention this claim in her initial statement
    to the police. Given this particular attack, we agree that it was open to
    the trial judge to rely on the specifics of the complainant’s disclosure
    to M.K. and M.F. in the fall of 2004 to rebut the suggestion that she fabricated
    her allegations of “blowjobs” and “handjobs” in her second statement to the
    police. See David Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence,</i> 4th

    in our view, the trial judge was not required to restrict his consideration
    of the complainant’s prior statement to M.K. and M.F. to the portion that
    referred to B.A. making her “do stuff” to him. The overall tenor of defence
    counsel’s attack was that the complainant “rarely gave the same version of
    events on consecutive occasions about any core allegation.”
    Further, in his submissions, defence counsel noted that the complainant did
    not tell anyone about the abuse as it was occurring and that she never told
    an adult about the abuse. All of this was designed to advance the defence
    position that the complainant’s evidence was a product of recent concoction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    defence counsel conceded that “every person would be expected to forget certain
    things” and “there would be some inconsistency regarding allegations of this
    nature”, he submitted that there were “serious inconsistencies” with respect
    to “each and every series or set of allegations” made by the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the essence of the defence position at trial was that the complainant
    had a motive to fabricate and that she could not keep her story straight
    because she was making things up as she went along. Viewed in that context,
    we think it was open to the trial judge to consider the overall consistency
    between the complainant’s disclosure to her friends, her statements to the
    police, and her trial evidence to rebut the allegation of recent concoction
    and lend general support to her credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge explained
    in a more fulsome way that he was using the complainant’s statements in response
    to the attack mounted by the defence, in our view, that is apparent from
    reading his reasons as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier
    in his reasons, the trial judge instructed himself correctly when he said, “I
    have recognized that I cannot use the content of prior consistent statements
    to determine whether her sworn testimony is credible.” In our view, when
    the trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole and are considered in the context
    of the evidence and submissions at trial, it is apparent that he was aware
    that he could not use the complainant’s prior consistent statements to prove
    the truth of their contents, and that he used them as a response to the defence
    attack of recent concoction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    contends that the trial judge’s reasons for judgment are inadequate because
    they do not permit him to know why he was convicted and because they do not
    show that the burden of proof was properly applied. In particular, B.A. submits
    that the trial judge failed to conduct any meaningful review of his evidence
    and to provide any explanation of why his evidence and B.M.’s evidence did
    not raise a reasonable doubt. Further, B.A. contends that the reasons include
    several statements which indicate that the trial judge misapplied the burden
    of proof: </p>

'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the complainant’s evidence, the trial judge proceeded directly
    from a finding that the complainant was credible to a finding of proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt when he made statements such as:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I find the statement evidence
    and the core of her evidence at trial entirely credible…. Although she was

'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only conclusions the trial judge expressed in relation to the evidence of
    B.A. and B.M. were: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I am convinced [B.M.’s]

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I prefer the complainant’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge explicitly stated
    that he rejected the defence evidence and provided a meaningful explanation
    for concluding that the defence evidence failed to raise a reasonable doubt.
    Nonetheless, we do not accept B.A.’s submissions for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>i)  The burden of proof
      was correctly applied</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    we are satisfied the trial judge did not misapply the burden of proof. In
    particular, we note that the trial judge specifically instructed himself
    on the principles set out in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397
    (S.C.C.), and that, later in his reasons, he said that his task was to “determine
    that [B.A.] is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or acquit him of [a particular]
    count.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
    more importantly, immediately following one of the impugned passages in his
    reasons, the trial judge explicitly stated that he had considered the defence
    evidence in reaching his conclusion that the essential elements of the offences
    were made out:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I find the statement evidence
    and the core of [the complainant’s] evidence at trial entirely credible.
    Such inconsistencies as the number of times certain incidents occurred did
    not weaken the essential accounts she gave in her original statement and
    in her evidence. Although she was cross examined skillfully and at length,
    the essential elements of the offences are made out in her evidence, beyond
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In reaching that conclusion,
    I have considered carefully the evidence of [B.A.] and [B.M.].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is at least implicit in the trial judge’s reasons that he did
    not accept the defence evidence and that he was satisfied it did not raise
    a reasonable doubt. Although we agree that it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge expressed himself more clearly, based on our review of
    his reasons, we are satisfied that he understood and properly applied the
    burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>ii)  The weaknesses of
      the defence evidence</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    second reason for rejecting B.A.’s submissions on this ground is that, after
    reviewing the entire record, we are satisfied it is apparent why the trial
    judge found the defence evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt. In our
    view, when considered in the light of human experience and common sense,
    B.A.’s evidence is not believable. Further, in our view, B.M.’s evidence
    was too unreliable to give rise to a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of example, in our view, B.A.’s claim of an innocent motive for his generosity
    toward and interest in the complainant does not make sense when compared
    with the harshness of his conduct in terminating their relationship in June
    2004. As we have said, B.A. acknowledged in his evidence that, as he did
    for B.M. with whom he had a longstanding relationship, he allowed the complainant
    to stay at his home on weekends, paid her for doing chores and getting good
    grades, took her out to restaurants and spent as much as $800 to $1000 on
    clothes for her in 2003 and 2004, including sixty pairs of underwear. In
    addition, B.A. allowed the complainant to stay at his home on weekdays after
    her parents were evicted from their farm and drove her to baseball practice
    daily.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.A.
    testified that he terminated his relationship with the complainant and sent
    back a graduation dress and accessories he had purchased for her because
    she had a temper tantrum over a cancelled baseball practice and because he
    had concerns about her smoking and drinking. Yet B.A. acknowledged in his
    evidence that he had never seen the complainant either smoke or drink; that
    when confronted about smoking, the complainant admitted she had a package
    of cigarettes but said she was holding it for someone else; and that the
    complainant’s step-father told him that the vodka bottle B.A. found among
    the complainant’s clothing was a keepsake from her grandfather who committed
    suicide. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant came from a troubled home in which there was little parental
    supervision or apparent concern for her welfare. She endured the death of
    an older sister in March 2003, her alcoholic grandfather’s suicide shortly
    thereafter, and her grandmother’s death in the spring of 2004. Her step-father
    acknowledged that he was often drunk during this period. Particularly when
    viewed in this context, B.A.’s response to the relatively minor misconduct
    he described appears extremely harsh. In our view, his reaction simply does
    not accord with the existence of innocent or altruistic motives for the level
    of generosity and interest he showed in a vulnerable adolescent female. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    having terminated his relationship with the complainant in the manner he
    did, in our view, it makes no sense that B.A. would allow her to return to
    his home and take her on a trip to Toronto in November of 2004 simply because
    B.M. asked if she could come. Portions of B.A.’s evidence concerning how
    this came about are contradictory. B.A. testified that when B.M. asked if
    the complainant could come to his home, he responded “only this once”. He
    claimed that he also said, “From now on, it’ll only be daytime. She will
    not be spending weekends.” Inexplicably, he then acknowledged that the complainant
    stayed overnight on that occasion and accompanied him, a friend and B.M.
    on a trip to
    <st2:place w:st="on">
      <st2:City
 w:st="on">Toronto</st2:City>
    </st2:place>
    . B.A. also acknowledged that he and the two girls stayed overnight together
    in a hotel room while they were in
    <st2:place
w:st="on">
      <st2:City w:st="on">Toronto</st2:City>
    </st2:place>
    . In our view, when considered in the light of human experience and common
    sense, B.A.’s evidence is highly problematic and unbelievable. Although he
    did not say so explicitly, this would have been apparent to the trial judge
    and it explains why he rejected B.A.’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to B.M.’s evidence, we note that it also suffered from many weaknesses. After
    she was sworn and before counsel began questioning her, she asked if she
    could say something. She apologized for crying and said she was “just really
    scared.” She explained that her cousin saw an e-mail in a chat-room the preceding
    year indicating her head would be cut off if she testified and that she was
    afraid that “might still stand”. In addition, B.M. said she was afraid of
    the Crown Attorney, the Children’s Aid Society and the police. She indicated
    that the police and the Children’s Aid Society told her mother that if she
    did not testify, they would send her mother to jail and place her in foster
    care. She also said that B.A. had been a part of her family since she was
    little and that she did not want her family to be broken up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in her evidence, B.M. expressed the hope that B.A. would someday marry her
    mother so that she would have “an actual family, with a dad”. She also testified
    that, apart from her mother, B.A. had been the only constant in her life
    since she was a young child. In addition, B.M. confirmed that she was concerned
    about dying when she talked to the police and she agreed that she had said, “I’m
    just always scared that it’s going to be the same and I’m going to get shot
    in the head or something.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked about the complainant’s scholastic abilities, B.M. volunteered that
    she had abilities the complainant did not have. She said she had the ability
    to see into people’s hearts and that she could tell if a person had a good
    heart by their actions. When asked if she believed B.A. had a good heart,
    B.M. answered in the affirmative. She also agreed that she would not want
    anything bad to happen to him and said that she
    “knew he wouldn’t hurt people, no matter what.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    on a paper record, B.M. presents as an emotionally fragile witness with a
    clear interest in securing B.A.’s acquittal. It is obvious to us, as indeed
    it was to the trial judge, that her evidence was not sufficiently reliable
    to raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in our opinion, two aspects of B.M.’s evidence provided some confirmation
    of the complainant’s version of events. Although B.M. testified in-chief
    that B.A. did not force her and the complainant to take daily showers, she
    acknowledged that he encouraged them to take showers. Later, in cross-examination,
    she confirmed that it was important to B.A. that the girls take a shower
    every night. In addition, B.M. confirmed in cross-examination that when B.A.
    quizzed the two girls about their homework in the living room, they were
    standing back-to-back. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, B.M.’s evidence provided important confirmation of the complainant’s
    evidence, as did the discovery of a hook in the ceiling of B.A.’s basement
    that was capable of bearing weight along with the discovery of a green bathrobe
    tie at B.A.’s home similar to the tie the complainant said he used to tie
    her to the ceiling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>c) Did the trial judge
      err by failing to address material inconsistencies in the complainant’s
      evidence?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.A.
    did not make oral submissions on this issue. In his factum, B.A. acknowledges
    that the trial judge referred to inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence
    but submits that the trial judge failed to resolve seven of the more problematic
    inconsistencies. He submits that this failure indicates that the trial judge
    was not sufficiently cognizant of the weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to B.A.’s position, the Crown argues that the alleged weaknesses
    identified by B.A. are either not true inconsistencies or weaknesses, or
    if they are, that they are adequately explained by other evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was alive to the
    frailties in the complainant’s evidence and adequately explain why he accepted
    her evidence. A trial judge is not required to address each and every alleged
    inconsistency in a witness’s testimony. As B.A. acknowledged, the trial judge
    referred to inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence in this case and
    explained why they did not undermine his confidence in her testimony. For
    example, he said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[Defence counsel at trial]
    argued that there were important inconsistencies in [the complainant’s] evidence.
    One such inconsistency is that she said, in the December 22<sup>nd</sup> statement,
    that [B.A.] paid her for certain sex acts, something she did not say in the
    first statement. At trial she denied that she had been paid and admitted
    that the second statement was given when she was high on weed…. In my view,
    the matter of whether he was paying her for sexual favours is of no consequence,
    and this inconsistency does not lessen my confidence in her truthfulness.
    Neither am I less confident of her evidence because she gave different numbers
    of occasions on which certain acts took place. As an adolescent participant
    in this pattern of perversion she was not likely to be keeping count. One
    should not expect her first statement to police to be a comprehensive account
    with specific occasions, numbers and dates. She was an adolescent girl with
    a story spanning two years or more; from age 12 to 14. She was recounting
    embarrassing sexual events under the influence of a senior, in a relationship
    of dependency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    therefore do not accept the defence submissions on this point. We would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>iv) Disposition of Conviction
      Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. CROWN APPEAL FROM
      SENTENCE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    convicted B.A. of all six counts in the indictment – sexual assault, sexual
    exploitation, assault with a weapon, assault, unlawful confinement and uttering
    a death threat – the trial judge sentenced him to a conditional sentence
    of two years less one day concurrent on all counts, plus three years’ probation.
    The trial judge also imposed several ancillary orders, none of which are
    at issue in this appeal. Rather, the appeal from sentence is directed solely
    at the imposition of a conditional sentence, a sentence which the Crown maintains
    is illegal, and in any event, wholly inadequate having regard to the gravity
    and seriousness of B.A.’s crimes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.A.
    concedes that the conditional sentence cannot be sustained. He accepts that
    the trial judge ran afoul of the principle in <i>R. v. Fice</i> by impermissibly
    taking into account the 130 days that B.A. spent in pre-trial custody (65
    days credited on a two for one basis) in determining that a sentence of two
    years less one day was within the appropriate range of available sentences,
    such that a conditional sentence could be considered as a sentencing option.
    The trial judge’s erroneous approach meant that B.A. effectively received
    a sentence of just over 28 months – a penitentiary term for which a conditional
    sentence was not available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be
    that as it may, B.A. submits that 28 months reflects the length of sentence
    that the trial judge considered appropriate. Given that he has now successfully
    completed the better part of 18 months of his conditional sentence (in addition
    to the 65 days he spent in pre-trial custody) and that he is currently 60
    years old and suffering from chronic back pain and thyroid cancer (as disclosed
    by the fresh evidence on appeal), B.A. submits that we should either dismiss
    the Crown’s appeal or craft a sentence that would relieve  him from having
    to return to custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to that submission. To the extent that the trial judge
    may have felt that 28 months was an appropriate length of sentence for the
    crimes committed by B.A., he was, in our respectful view, mistaken. Twenty-eight
    months does not begin to reflect the gravity and seriousness of B.A.’s crimes,
    nor the enormity of the harm he inflicted on the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant, to B.A.’s knowledge, was particularly vulnerable. She was emotionally
    fragile and came from a difficult home life. Money was scarce, living quarters
    were cramped and the family had recently experienced the death of the complainant’s
    older sister and her maternal grandparents. Under these circumstances, it
    is not surprising that the complainant found the prospect of spending time
    at B.A.’s home appealing. Needless to say, she looked to B.A. –  who was
    almost five times her age and purportedly a man of good character – for guidance,
    affection and attention. However, what she hoped for and what she received
    were vastly different. In what can only be described as a gross breach of
    trust, B.A. abused the complainant physically, sexually and psychologically
    on a regular and persistent basis for a period of at least one and a half
    years. He did so by means of inducements, threats and demeaning and humiliating
    acts of violence. The details of his despicable conduct have been set out
    elsewhere; they need not be repeated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is apparent is that without the slightest hint of remorse or compunction,
    B.A. was only too willing to place his deviant needs over the needs of an
    innocent child. In the process, as the complainant’s victim impact statement
    reveals, he robbed her of her innocence and left her psychologically and
    emotionally scarred and damaged for life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has made it clear in recent years that conduct of this nature will
    not be tolerated and when it is uncovered, it will be dealt with harshly.
    See <i>R. v.
    <st1:middlename

    D. D.</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471; <i>R. v. G. A. G.</i>, [2006] O.J.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    in addition to the aggravating factors already mentioned, B.A. continues
    to maintain his innocence and shows no insight into the gravity and seriousness
    of his crimes and the harm he has caused the complainant. Specific deterrence
    therefore becomes prominent and must be considered alongside the other principles
    of sentencing that are paramount in cases of this nature – denunciation,
    general deterrence and, in some instances, separating the offender from society.
    Although the trial judge adverted to some of these principles and purported
    to recognize their prominence, it is apparent from his reasons that he did
    not give them the weight they deserved. Rather, the trial judge focussed
    on the needs of B.A. and his prospects for rehabilitation in fashioning a
    sentence that in our view was woefully inadequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    into account B.A.’s age, his medical problems at the time of sentencing and
    the fact that he had no prior criminal record, we think an appropriate sentence
    at trial would have been five to six years in the penitentiary. At this juncture,
    given that he has completed the better part of 18 months of his conditional
    sentence and taking into account the further medical problem he has encountered,
    the time he has already spent in pre-trial custody, and the fact that he
    must now be re-incarcerated, we would impose a sentence of three and one-half
    years concurrent on all counts, commencing on the day that B.A. surrenders
    into custody or is apprehended and taken into custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    aside. All other aspects of the sentence imposed at trial shall remain the
    same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and
