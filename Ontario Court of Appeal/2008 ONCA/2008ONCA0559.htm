  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the convictions for sexual assault and sexual interference
    are unreasonable.  His main ground of appeal is that the inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s evidence and, in at least one instance, an outright
    lie, rendered her overall testimony too unreliable to support the convictions.  The
    appellant buttresses this ground of appeal by arguing that the trial judge
    erred in giving any confirmatory weight to the mother’s evidence in the light
    of its obvious unreliability.  We do not accept the appellant’s submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alive to the problems in both the complainant’s and her mother’s
    testimony.  He addressed these problems and gave reasons why he accepted
    their testimony, especially the testimony of the complainant.  We are not
    persuaded that he committed any reviewable error in his assessment of the
    credibility and reliability of the evidence of these two witnesses.  Their
    evidence, with all its frailties, reasonably supports the convictions for
    sexual assault and sexual interference.  Therefore, the appellant’s submission
    fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the conviction for accessing child pornography
    is unreasonable.  The defence conceded that the April 13 photos were child
    pornography under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  However, the appellant contends
    that the trial judge erred in relying on these photos in the light of the
    Crown’s statement at the preliminary inquiry it was “not relying on the events
    of that day to support the charges”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with this contention.  The appellant accessed these photos seven
    days after the incident on April 13.  This act of accessing the photos was
    separate from the acts that took place on April 13, and was not covered by
    the Crown’s statement at the preliminary inquiry.  However, even if the Crown’s
    statement was broad enough to cover the April 13 photos, in our view, there
    was other evidence to support the conviction on this count.  Apart from the
    April 13 photos, the trial judge was entitled to rely on the complainant’s
    evidence that she sent the appellant “sexual” photos of herself on other
    occasions.  Although these other photos were not put in evidence, the chat
    logs support the complainant’s testimony and provide a reasonable basis for
    finding that these photos were child pornography.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we do not think that it is open to the appellant to raise for the first time
    on appeal the “private use” exception recognized by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. Sharpe</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45.  We agree with the Crown
    that the appellant has failed to show a sufficient evidentiary record to
    resolve this issue.  In particular, we have no finding or adequate record
    to determine whether the sexual activity was consensual.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
