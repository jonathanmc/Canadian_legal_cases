    central issue in this appeal is whether the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in overturning the motion judge’s finding that the
    wife was not entitled to retroactive child support.  In concluding that the
    wife was not entitled to such support, the motion judge found as a fact that
    the 1997 amending agreement continued in force until January 2005.  It was
    his view of the evidence that the discussions that took place between the
    parties in April 2001 did not constitute a renegotiation so as to result
    in a termination of that agreement.  In our view, that finding was supportable
    on the evidence.  In particular, the motion judge had before him an email
    dated April 26, 2001, in which the wife indicated that she was willing to
    accept cheques for the next year in the amount of $1700 per month and not
    go to arbitration.  As well, the husband continued paying $1700 per month
    until January 2005 without comment or objection from the wife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the finding of an ongoing agreement - which, in our view, provided for reasonable
    child support - unlike the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, we do not believe that in denying retroactive child support,
    the motion judge ran afoul of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in the trilogy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  However,
    even if he did, the motion judge found as a further fact that throughout
    the years 2001 to 2005, the parties continued with their arrangement whereby
    the children were with their mother four days each week and with their father
    three days per week.   On the basis of that evidence, he found that for the
    period following 2005, the husband had care of the son more than 40% of the
    time.  He therefore found that that s. 9 of the <i>Guidelines </i>relating
    to shared custody applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court disagreed with that finding and directed that if the parties
    could not agree, the question of shared custody should be dealt with by way
    of a trial of an issue.  In our respectful view, it was open to the motion
    judge to make the finding he did with respect to shared custody and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in concluding otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the motion judge’s finding that the 1997 amending agreement continued until
    2005, it was unnecessary for him to engage in a similar “shared custody” analysis
    for the years 2001 to 2005.  Had he done so, it is clear from his reasons
    that he would have come to the same conclusion with respect to both children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the analysis prepared by the wife’s counsel, if there was no continuing agreement
    from 2001 to 2005 and the guidelines applied, then based on the shared custody
    finding and the amount paid by the husband during the requisite timeframe,
    the wife would have been owed retroactive child support in the amount of
    $7,054.  On the husband’s calculation, he would have overpaid the wife by
    $3,558.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    calculations support our conclusion that the amount paid by the husband pursuant
    to the continuing agreement during the period from 2001 to 2005 was reasonable.  As
    such, this is a second reason for sustaining the motion judge’s conclusion
    that this was not a case for retroactive child support.  In this regard,
    we note as well that the husband did not at any time mislead the wife about
    his income or assets, nor is there any evidence that the children’s needs
    were not amply provided for during the years 2001 to 2005.  Indeed, the evidence
    suggests the opposite.   Additionally, we accept the motion judge’s criticism
    of the wife that the filing of the original 1993 agreement with the FRO,
    without disclosing that it had been twice amended, was “unjustified”.  Finally,
    we note that the wife provided no reasonable explanation for waiting until
    2005 before filing the original agreement with the FRO and that her claim
    for retroactive support was, in the opinion of the motion judge, “a tactical
    response to the father’s meritorious claim for a reduction in child support”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we are satisfied that the motion judge correctly concluded that
    the husband was not obliged to pay retroactive child support to the wife
    and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in concluding otherwise. Accordingly, paragraph 6
    of the order of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court is set aside and paragraph 10 of the motion judge’s order
    is reinstated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the remaining aspects of the motion judge’s order, we are satisfied
    that it was open to him to conclude that the child support payments for the
    son subsequent to January 2005 should be calculated on the basis of  s. 9
    of the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>.  Further, we see no basis for interfering
    with his finding that as of August 2005, the daughter resided fulltime with
    the husband.
     To the extent that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court found otherwise, we respectfully disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties are optimistic that, armed with these conclusions, they will be able
    to resolve any outstanding issues in relation to child support from January
    2005 to the present and forward.  If this proves wrong, they may return to
    the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
