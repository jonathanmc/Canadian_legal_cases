      Concrete Forming Inc. is a company that constructs concrete footings and
      concrete foundation walls for homes being built in the Greater Toronto
      Area. In the spring and early summer of 2002, Ani-Wall contracted with
      several home builders to supply the concrete and construct the footings
      and foundation walls for a number of homes under construction. Because
      Ani-Wall does not manufacture concrete, it retained the services of Dominion
      Concrete Group Limited to supply the concrete it needed to fulfill its
      contractual obligations.  Dominion’s task was to prepare the concrete to
      specifications and deliver it to pre-arranged job sites. At the sites,
      the concrete would be off-loaded and poured by Ani-Wall employees into
      forms constructed by Ani-Wall. Once the concrete hardened, the forms would
      be removed, leaving in place the concrete footings and foundation walls. </span></p>

      concrete supplied by Dominion for the projects turned out to be defective.
      This meant that the builders had to repair, and in some cases remove and
      replace, the footings and foundation walls constructed by Ani-Wall, at
      considerable cost. The builders were also required to repair any further
      damage caused by or resulting from the measures taken to correct Ani-Wall’s
      defective work. The builders sued Ani-Wall for breach of contract and negligence,
      seeking damages for the consequential losses they had sustained.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      all material times, Ani-Wall was insured under a commercial general liability
      insurance policy issued by AXA Insurance (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ). That policy covered Ani-Wall for losses arising from “property damage”.
    AXA acknowledged that the damage to the houses constituted “property damage” within
    the meaning of the policy. Hence, coverage per se was not an issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      AXA maintained that the scope of its duty to indemnify Ani-Wall was limited
      by three exclusionary provisions in the policy: the “Your Product” exclusion,
      the
    “Your Work” exclusion and a “Rip and Tear” exclusion contained in an endorsement
    to the policy, referable specifically to concrete products.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>AXA
      asserted that by virtue of these three exclusionary provisions, it had
      no obligation to indemnify Ani-Wall for any damages asserted by the builders
      in the underlying actions, except for “the cost of repairing damage to
      other portions of the structure existing as at the time the concrete was
      found to be defective”. This meant that, among other things, Ani-Wall would
      not be indemnified for the cost of repairing, removing or replacing the
      defective footings and foundation walls it had constructed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      disagreed with AXA’s interpretation of the three exclusionary provisions,
      prompting AXA to apply to the Superior Court of Justice for a declaratory
      order defining and limiting the scope of its duty to indemnify Ani-Wall.
      The application was heard on October 1, 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      October 18, 2007, the application judge delivered extensive reasons in
      which he dismissed AXA’s application, finding that “none of the three exclusions
      to the admitted coverage apply.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>AXA
      appeals from that judgment. Its position on appeal is narrower than the
      position it advanced before the application judge. In this court, AXA relies
      on the “Your Work” exclusion to relieve it from having to indemnify Ani-Wall
      for the cost of repairing, removing or replacing the defective footings
      and foundation walls. Failing that, AXA relies on a portion of the “Rip
      and Tear”
    exclusion to relieve it from having to indemnify Ani-Wall for the cost of
    removing defective footings and foundation walls, but not from the cost of
    repairing or replacing them. AXA no longer relies on the “Your Product”
    exclusion or the “restoration expenses” segment of the “Rip and Tear” exclusion
    in this court. I propose to tailor my analysis accordingly.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“Subcontractor”
    is not defined in the policy.  AXA submits that because Dominion merely supplied
    ready-made concrete to Ani-Wall
    “on a series of contracts for the sale of goods”, Dominion was not a subcontractor,
    but a mere supplier. According to AXA, a subcontractor is “one who performs
    for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labour or
    material requirements of the original contract”. The determinative test is “the
    substantiality and importance of [the] relationship with the prime contractor.”
    See <i>MacEvoy Co. v. United States ex rel. Tomkins Co.,</i> 322 U.S. 102
    (1944) and <i>F.D. Rich Co., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber
    Co., Inc.,</i> 417 U.S. 116 (1974). AXA acknowledges that these two authorities
    do not consider the word “subcontractor” in the insurance context, but rather
    as it is used in the <i>Miller Act</i>, 40 U.S.C.S. §270a <i>et</i> <i>seq.</i>,
    an Act designed to protect persons who provide labour or materials to public
    projects. AXA nonetheless urges a similar interpretation in the insurance
    context.</span></p>

      refers to three additional American authorities in which the word “subcontractor” <i>is</i> considered
      in the insurance context and is differentiated from a mere supplier for
      the purposes of “Your Work” exclusions. See <i>Wanzek Construction Inc.
      v. Employers Insurance of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wausau</i>, 679 N.W. 2d 322 (
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Minn. Sup.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Ct. 2004); <i>Limbach Company LLC v. Zurich American Insurance Co</i>., 396
    F. 3d 358 (4th Cir. 2005); and <i>National Union Fire Insurance</i> <i>Co.
    v. Structural Systems Technology, Inc.</i>, 964 F. 2d 759 (8th Cir. 1992),
    aff’g 756 F. Supp. 1232 (E.D. Mo. 1991). According to these authorities,
    the following three criteria should be used to identify a subcontractor:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The product supplied should be custom made according to specifications
      identified in the prime contract;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The supplier should provide on-site installation or supervision
      services; and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The product supplied should form an integral or substantial
      part of the prime contract.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I note that in
      each of the authorities mentioned, only two criteria were met, and then,
      to varying degrees.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>AXA
      submits that when the three criteria are applied to this case, Dominion
      fails to meet the requirements of a subcontractor. The concrete that it
      supplied to Ani-Wall consisted of “off the shelf” ready-mix that Ani-Wall
      could have purchased from any one of a dozen suppliers; it required no
      meaningful customization. Nor did Dominion provide on-site labour or installation
      services; it simply delivered the concrete to the job-site in one of its
      trucks. The fact that the concrete formed an integral part of Ani-Wall’s
      final product could not, of itself, cause Dominion to be a subcontractor.
      According to AXA, regardless of the importance of the concrete to Ani-Wall,
      Dominion effectively provided a delivery service for ready-made product
      and was therefore a mere supplier.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge considered this issue in his reasons. He found as a fact
    that Dominion was a subcontractor and that Ani-Wall could therefore rely
    on the “subcontractor” exception to the “Your Work”
    exclusion. The application judge’s analysis is brief and appears to rely
    on this court’s decision in <i>Bridgewood Building Corp. v. Lombard General
    Insurance Co.</i> (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 494, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 204, as a full answer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the subcontractor exemption applies
    to the factual circumstances of the case at bar. The reasoning in <i>Bridgewood
    Building Corp. v. Lombard General Insurance Co., supra</i>, discussed above,
    in which the subcontractor exemption was applied, applies to the case at
    bar; visualize: (a) there was insurance coverage for property damage caused
    by Ani-Wall’s defective work; (b) although the Your Work Exclusion would
    exclude the insurance coverage, this exclusion does not apply where Ani-Wall’s
    work (which by definition includes work performed on its behalf and materials
    furnished in connection with the work) was performed by a subcontractor;
    and (c) indeed, Ani-Wall’s work was performed by a subcontractor; namely,
    Dominion Concrete. See also: <i>Limbach Company, LLC v. Zurich American Insurance

    of course, is not a full answer. The application judge’s reference to two
    of the American authorities cited by AXA on appeal indicates that he may
    have recognized this. Whether he did or not, it is worth clarifying that
    although the facts in <i>Bridgewood</i> bear many similarities to the facts
    of this case, including Dominion’s involvement as the supplier of defective
    concrete, this court in <i>Bridgewood</i> did not address (nor was it asked
    to address) the issue of Dominion’s status. Rather, the case was argued on
    the basis that the “Your Work”
    exclusion applied even if the defective work was attributable to a subcontractor
    employed by the insured. By contrast, this case raises four-square the issue
    of Dominion’s status. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that in mind, I return to AXA’s submission that this court should transpose
    into our law the three criteria identified in the American authorities, cited
    above at para.&nbsp;13, by which subcontractors are distinguished from mere
    suppliers. With respect, I would not do so.  I come to this conclusion not
    because I reject the criteria outright or find them unhelpful in differentiating
    a subcontractor from a mere supplier for insurance purposes, but rather because
    I am reluctant to carve them in stone. Instead, I prefer to retain a degree
    of flexibility in the realm of insurance coverage, especially in cases like
    this, where coverage is acknowledged but the insurer seeks to rely on exclusionary
    provisions to limit its scope. As Ani-Wall points out, if insurers want to
    lay down hard and fast criteria, they can do so by defining the word
    “subcontractor” to their choosing. Insured persons who pay substantial premiums
    would then know where they stand and would not be left guessing about the
    extent of the coverage available to them. To date, for reasons unknown, AXA
    has chosen not to define the word “subcontractor” in the policy. Unless and
    until it does so, I believe the word should be construed broadly, lest it
    become a trap for the unwary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the contracts between Ani-Wall and the builders specified that
    Ani-Wall would supply the concrete needed to construct the footings and foundation
    walls. Under the heading “General Terms and Conditions of Contract”, clauses
    A and B provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A/  We <i>supply</i> and place 15 MPa concrete
    in footings as per contract allowance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>B/  We form walls at height and thickness indicated, <i>supply</i> and
    place 15 MPa concrete. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Elsewhere in the contracts with
    the builders, Ani-Wall reserves to itself “the right at its discretion to
    sublet any portion of this contract to a reputable contractor.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    significance of Ani-Wall contracting to supply the concrete is explained
    by Ani-Wall’s senior manager, Mr. Steve Indio. In an affidavit sworn by him
    on September 20, 2007, Mr. Indio states that in many centres outside the
    Greater Toronto Area, ready-mix concrete is sold directly to builders. By
    contrast, Ani-Wall has taken on that responsibility in its contract with
    the builders, and it “pay[s] the supplier” and “include[s] the cost of the
    ready-mix in [its] bill.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I acknowledge that this case is close to the line, given my view that the
    word “subcontractor” should be construed broadly and that any ambiguity in
    its meaning must, as a matter of law, be resolved in favour of Ani-Wall,
    I think it can reasonably be said that Ani-Wall subcontracted to Dominion
    its contractual obligation to <i>supply</i> concrete to the builders. In
    doing so, it triggered the “subcontractor”
    exception to the “Your Work” exclusion. At the very least, AXA has not met
    its burden of showing otherwise. For that reason, it follows that the “Your
    Work”
    exclusion is ousted by the “subcontractor” exception. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if I were to apply the American criteria, my conclusion would remain
    the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the terms of its contracts with the builders, Ani-Wall was required to supply
    concrete of a particular strength and viscosity.
     While I accept that the concrete ordered by Ani-Wall is readily available
    and relatively easy to make, a degree of skill is nonetheless required to
    ensure that it is manufactured to specification and arrives that way at the
    job site. If, upon arrival, the concrete does not appear to meet the required
    viscosity, Dominion’s driver is required to use his judgment and add the
    right amount of water to correct the deficiency. This information, though
    not contained in the original record, has recently been submitted to this
    court with the consent of the parties in a letter dated June 11, 2008. The
    additional facts upon which the parties have agreed are reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Ontario Building Code specifies the minimum
    strength (15 MPa) and ‘slump’ for concrete for single-family residences. ‘Slump’ refers
    to the viscosity of the concrete and is measured in inches. A 5” slump is,
    for example, drier than a 6” slump (the maximum under the O.B.C.). A forming
    contractor can order different strengths and slumps as is desired for the
    particular job. Ani-Wall, for example, would sometimes order a 3” or a 5” slump.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the concrete ordered appeared too dry at the
    site, Ani-Wall would insist that the driver provide concrete of the proper
    slump as ordered. It was then up to the driver to add such water as he, in
    his judgment, deemed appropriate to produce the desired slump.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Measured
    against the first two criteria in the American authorities for identifying
    a subcontractor, manufacturing the concrete to specification and possible
    driver input would likely not be enough to categorize Dominion as a subcontractor.
    But when those factors are combined with the materiality of the concrete
    to Ani-Wall’s contracts with the builders and the integral part it plays
    in Ani-Wall’s final product, I believe that Dominion meets the test. Manifestly,
    concrete is essential to the work performed by Ani-Wall. If it does not comprise
    the only component of Ani-Wall’s final product, it certainly comprises the
    principal one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    as a whole, I am satisfied that Dominion’s involvement constituted a substantial
    portion of the contracts between Ani-Wall and the builders. Dominion was
    required to manufacture the concrete to specification and to ensure that
    it was of the proper viscosity when it arrived on site. Dominion was also
    responsible for furnishing all of the concrete needed by Ani-Wall to construct
    its final product. For its part, Ani-Wall took up the responsibility of supplying
    the concrete to the builders (unlike the situation in other parts of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario) and it paid Dominion and included the cost of the concrete in its
    bill to the builders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these additional reasons, I am satisfied that Dominion was properly characterized
    as a subcontractor and that AXA is accordingly barred from relying on the “Your
    Work” exclusion. </p>

      acknowledges that the “Rip and Tear” clause is badly drafted and that read
      literally, it is difficult to comprehend. AXA nonetheless urges a less-literal
      interpretation and submits that when the clause is read purposefully, its
      meaning is plain and obvious – AXA will not indemnify Ani-Wall for the
