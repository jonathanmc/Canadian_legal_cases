    September 22, 2006, Ahmad Alrifai (the appellant), a self-employed limousine
    driver, and his legal agent, Harry Kopyto, appeared before a justice of the
    peace. Their purpose, they said, was to lay an information before the justice,
    have the justice receive it, and persuade the justice to issue process compelling
    a Peel Regional Police officer to answer a charge under s. 39.1 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (<i>HTA</i>).  The conduct alleged to
    have breached the section took place on April 13, 2006.  </p>

    appellant and Harry Kopyto are not police officers. Nor are they officers
    appointed for carrying out the provisions of the <i>HTA</i>.  And what is
    more, when they appeared before the justice of peace on September 22, 2006,
    not only did they not have the required consent, they had sought and had
    been refused consent by the only person they had asked, a police sergeant
    at a Division of the Toronto Police Service.</p>

    justice of the peace refused to receive the information the appellant and

    appellant sought an order in lieu of a writ of <i>mandamus </i>from a judge
    of the Superior Court of Justice (the application judge) directing the justice
    of the peace “to hear and consider the allegations of the Informant and evidence
    of witnesses and comply with s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada </i>[<i>sic</i>]”.  The
    application judge dismissed the application.  The appellant appeals.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after 8:00 a.m. on April 13, 2006, a police officer stopped the appellant
    who was driving his limousine south on Highway 427, just south of Highway
    401.  The appellant had a passenger in his limousine.  When the appellant
    failed to produce any licence that authorized him to transport passengers
    for compensation from an airport to another destination, the officer called
    a licenced limousine company to pick up the passenger and issued the appellant
    a ticket.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime
    later, the appellant claims that he went to 23 Division police station to
    seek consent to prosecute the officer who had stopped his limousine and had
    contacted the other company to transport the passenger to his or her destination.  According
    to the appellant, a police officer, Sgt. Little refused to consent to the
    institution of the prosecution.</p>

    23(1) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (<i>POA</i>)
    describes the authority to lay an information and the correlative duty of
    a justice of the peace to receive the information laid by an informant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            23. (1)              Any person who,
    on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that one or more persons have
    committed an offence, may lay an information in the prescribed form and under

    24(1) of the <i>POA</i> sets out the obligations of the justice who receives
    an information laid under s. 23.  The obligations are these:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            24. (1)  A justice who receives an
    information laid under section 23 shall consider the information and, where
    he or she considers it desirable to do so, hear and consider in the absence
    of the defendant the allegations of the informant and the evidence of witnesses
    and,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>            (a)       where he or she considers
    that a case for doing so is made out,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>            (i)      confirm the summons           served  under
    section 22, if            any,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>            (ii)       issue a summons in the         prescribed
    form, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where
    the arrest is authorized by statute and where the allegations of the informant
    or the evidence satisfy the justice on reasonable and probable grounds that
    it is necessary in the public interest to do so, issue a warrant for the
    arrest of the defendant; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>            (b)       where he or she considers
    that a case for issuing process is not made out,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>                        (i)        so endorse
    the information,                                     and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where

    39.1(3) of the <i>HTA</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            39.1(3) No person shall arrange or
    offer to arrange for a passenger to be picked up in a motor vehicle other
    than a bus for the purpose of being transported for compensation except under

    39.1(9) requires the consent of a police officer or an officer appointed
    to carry out the provisions of the <i>HTA</i> to the institution of a prosecution
    under s. 39.1.  The section says nothing about the form of consent or about
    what is meant by its opening words, “no prosecution shall be instituted”.  Section
    39.1(9) is in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            39.1(9)  No prosecution shall be instituted
    under this section without the consent of a police officer appointed for
    carrying out the provisions of this Act.</p>

      JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dismissed the appellant’s application for an order in lieu
    of <i>mandamus</i>.  The dismissal rested on three grounds:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>i.          The justice of the peace was correct in holding that he could
    not consider the information in the absence of the consent required by s.
    39.1(9) of the <i>HTA</i>;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>ii.         Even if the justice of the peace was required to receive
    the information, the lack of consent meant that the justice had no authority
    to decide whether process should issue, thus the result would be the same;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>iii.       The appellant’s constitutional challenge to s. 39.1(9) failed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant reinvigorates the submissions made without success before the application
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that, even without the consent required to institute the prosecution,
    the justice of the peace was obliged to receive the information and to determine
    whether a <i>prima facie </i>case for the issuance of process on the basis
    of the informant’s allegations and the evidence of any witnesses offered
    on the informant’s behalf, had been made out.  After all, a private citizen
    has an inalienable right to lay an information and have a hearing conducted
    to decide whether process should issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the position of the appellant that a prosecution is not instituted until
    process is issued. The effect of s. 39.1(9) of the <i>HTA</i> is to give
    police officers a veto power over prosecutions, including, as here, prosecutions
    of fellow officers who commit offences under s. 39.1.  The only check on
    arbitrariness is to have the justice of the peace conduct a hearing to determine
    whether the informant has presented a <i>prima facie</i> case.  Refusal of
    consent in such circumstances would be an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further contends that the consent requirement in s. 39.1(9) of
    the <i>HTA</i> offends s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter. </i>The section creates
    an inequality between police and other informants, one that is <i>not</i> justifiable
    under s. 1 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>

    23(1) of the <i>POA</i> entitles anyone who has the required state of belief
    to lay an information in the prescribed form and under oath before a justice.
    The section imposes a correlative duty on the justice to receive the information
    compliant with the section.  In other words, s. 23(1) creates a right (for
    the informant) and a duty (for the justice).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    23(1) is a provision of general application, predictably silent about the
    right of an informant to lay an information and the duty of a justice to
    receive it where the statute allegedly contravened requires consent to the
    institution of a prosecution.  Further, neither s. 23(1) nor any other provision
    of the <i>POA</i> to which we have been referred defines or otherwise elucidates
    the meaning to be assigned to the introductory words “no prosecution shall
    be instituted”, as the limitation appears in s. 39.1(9) of the <i>HTA </i>and
    elsewhere in the catalogue of provincial statutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Linamar Holdings Inc.</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4859, this court considered
      the meaning to be assigned to the provisions of s. 69 of the <i>Occupational
      Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 0.1, which provides that no “prosecution … shall
      be instituted” more than one year after the last act upon which the prosecution
      is based occurred.  Linamar argued, as the appellant does here, that a
      prosecution is not instituted until an information is laid and a summons
      or  warrant issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court concluded in <i>Linamar</i> at para. 8:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Second, a prosecution is instituted within the
    meaning of s. 69 once the information is laid before a justice of the peace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    39.1(9) of the <i>HTA </i>requires consent to the <i>institution </i>of a<i> prosecution</i>.  Similar
    language, that is to say, “no prosecution shall be instituted …”, appears
    in other provincial statutes, for example, s. 44(2) of the <i>Human Rights
    Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19; s. 75(4) of the <i>Police Services Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15; s. 32 of the <i>Public Vehicles Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.54; and s. 22.12(4) of the <i>Regulated Health Professions Act</i>, <i>Schedule
    2</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 18, to name but a few.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court in <i>Linamar</i> contrasted the <i>commencement</i> of a prosecution
    or proceedings, on the one hand, with the <i>institution</i> of a prosecution
    or proceedings, on the other.  At paragraph 10 of <i>Linamar</i>, the court
    held: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            [10]     The respondents also rely
    upon language in <i>Southam Inc. v. Coulter </i>(1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 1 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) where the court, referring to passages from <i>Dowson</i>, held at p. 7
    that “a prosecution commences only after a justice of the peace has decided
    to issue process”.  It may be that in some contexts a prosecution only commences
    with the issue of process but that does not answer the question of when a
    prosecution is instituted.  The laying of the information before a justice
    of the peace is the first formal step taken in the proceedings before the
    Provincial Offences Court and in our view constitutes the institution of
    the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under <i>Linamar</i>,
    a prosecution is <i>instituted</i> within the meaning of s. 39.1(9) of the <i>HTA</i> once
    the information has been laid before the justice of the peace. The section
    requires that a police officer or officer appointed for the purpose of carrying
    out the provisions of the <i>HTA </i>consent to the <i>institution </i>of
    the prosecution, that is to say, to the laying of the information.  Absent
    the consent required by the statute, the justice of the peace, following <i>Linamar</i>,
    was not required to receive the information under s. 23(1) of the <i>POA</i>.  It
    follows that the justice of the peace was correct in declining to receive
    the information and the application judge was right in refusing to compel
    the justice to do so.</p>

    if it were open to conclude, despite <i>Linamar</i>, that a prosecution is
    not instituted until what might be termed the “process hearing” has been
    undertaken, the absence of consent would nonetheless foreclose the issuance
    of process.</p>

    to answer an allegation of a breach of a provincial statute involves the
    exercise of a judicial discretion under s. 24(1) of the <i>POA</i>.  The
    justice must consider whether a case for issuing process has been made out
    on the basis of the allegations of the informant and the evidence of any
    witnesses who testify.  Where a consent to the institution of proceedings
    is required by statute, but is lacking, the statutory authority to issue
    process under s. 24(1) is simply not engaged.  Satisfaction of a condition
    precedent to its exercise is lacking.</p>

    remedies are discretionary: they do not issue as of right.  Nor do they issue
    where no useful purpose would be served by their issuance.  <i>R. v. Board

    ) at 671.  In this case, to remit the matter to the justice of the peace
    to conduct a process hearing would serve no useful purpose:  the absence
    of consent bars the issuance of process.</p>

    appellant challenges the constitutional integrity of the consent requirement
    in s. 39.1(9) of the <i>HTA</i>.  He alleges that the requirement of consent
    to institution of a prosecution where the informant is not a police officer
    or an officer appointed for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
    the <i>HTA</i> offends s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The provision is
    discriminatory because it creates two classes of informant:  the officers
    described in s. 39.1(9) who, on their own, can institute a prosecution, and
    everybody else.  In the result, the appellant says, the section offends s.
    15(1) of the <i>Charter.</i></p>

    if we cede to the appellant that s. 39.1(9) has the effect of treating some
    informants differently than others, the appellant’s case founders: the differential
    treatment of informants, in essence on the basis of occupation, is <i>not</i> based
    on an enumerated or analogous ground, nor is the differential treatment discriminatory.  <i>Rudolf
