    purpose of trafficking was significantly lower than that usually trafficked,

    grow operation was found on the Jarzabek property just beyond the rear boundary
    of the appellant’s land.  The officers
    couldn’t determine how far back the appellant had travelled or what he did when
    he arrived there.  Sometimes, the lights

    non-suit.  In essence, Mr. Bruzzese
    recounts information received from the prosecutor in early January 2006, that
    analyses of <i>cannabis resin </i>in three
    containers seized near the appellant’s property revealed concentrations of THC

    of circumstantial evidence.  In the
    result, the argument continued, the trial judge would have great difficulty in
    assigning appropriate weight to the proposed evidence because of the finding of
    guilt the trial judge had already made, and the time that had elapsed after the

    determine whether the evidence was credible, that is to say reasonably capable

    to have affected the result at trial, when taken together with the other

    surmounts each threshold, although the evidence about THC concentration would
    affect the appellant’s liability on one count only, and on a single issue (the
    purpose of possession).  Mr. Campbell
    acknowledges that the trial judge also had to consider whether the application

    Egan says that the trial judge, confronted with the applications, had a
    gatekeeper function to perform.  The

    application.  The defence bore a heavy
    onus.  The appellant did not testify to
    deny his participation in the grow operation in the face of a formidable
    circumstantial case.  The proposed

    Egan emphasizes the paucity of detail revealed in the Czernik affidavit.  Nothing about the number or size of the
    plants, nor about access to the area, which must have been frequent in light of
    the level of attention obviously directed to the crop.  A three-year time gap between the discovery
    of the grow and the acceptance of responsibility.  The affiant’s admission does not exclude a

    leave to appeal refused, [1997] 1 S.C.R. viii, this court articulated the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The
    test for re-opening the defence case when the application is made prior to

    ). However, once the trial
    judge has convicted the accused a more rigorous test is required to protect the
    integrity of the process, including the enhanced interest in finality.  It seems to have been common ground in this
    case that the most appropriate test for determining whether or not to permit
    the fresh evidence to be admitted is the test for admissibility of fresh
    evidence on appeal laid down in <i>Palmer
    and Palmer v. The Queen</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.) at page 205
