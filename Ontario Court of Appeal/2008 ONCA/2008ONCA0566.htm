    Siegel J., which recognized as enforceable a
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    civil judgment against them in the amount of $36,617,696 U.S.D.  The judgment
    was obtained by the respondents, Dorian King and Diane King, representative
    plaintiffs in a U.S. class action proceeding.  The appellants argued that
    the Ontario courts should decline to recognize the U.S. judgment on the basis
    that they were denied a full opportunity to defend the proceedings.  That
    denial, they argued, arose because outstanding criminal charges effectively
    precluded them from testifying in the U.S. civil proceeding.  The application
    judge rejected the appellants’ argument and recognized the U.S. judgment.  For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents were investors in Livent Inc. (Livent), an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario corporation that operated in both
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
      The appellants were officers and directors of Livent.  The respondents
    commenced a U.S. class action against the appellants in 1998 in New York
    State.  The action alleged misrepresentations regarding Livent’s financial
    situation were contained in a 1997 registration statement, which the appellants
    signed and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in support
    of a distribution of unsecured notes.  In 1998, Livent released restated
    financial results, which reduced its net income by U.S. $85,100,000.  Consequently,
    Livent became insolvent and the unsecured notes worthless.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the respondents’ lawsuit and other civil suits, the appellants
    were charged criminally with fraud in the U.S. in 1999.  In 2002, they were
    charged with similar offences in Canada.  Once the Canadian charges were
    laid, the appellants could no longer be extradited to face the U.S. criminal
    charges.  This was because art. 4(1)(i) of the <strong><i><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Extradition
    Treaty Between
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the United States of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
    </span></i></strong><b>,</b> Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, provides that extradition
    will not be granted by the “requested state” when the accused is being “proceeded
    against … for the offense for which his extradition is requested.”  Consequently,
    the U.S. has never pursued the appellants’ extradition and the appellants
    have demonstrated their intention not to return to the U.S. to face the charges
    in that country.  The appellants did not seek a stay of the U.S. civil action
    because, according to their U.S. counsel, a stay would have been refused
    since it would have effectively amounted to an outright dismissal of the
    class proceeding in light of the appellants’ intention not to face the U.S.
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    their depositions, which were conducted in Canada and subsequently filed
    in the U.S. proceeding, the appellants claimed the protection accorded to
    them under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and declined to answer
    any questions on the grounds that their answers would be incriminatory. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the face of a summary judgment motion brought by the respondents in 2004,
    the appellants asserted a defence of due diligence.  That defence required
    the appellants to establish that they had, after reasonable investigation,
    reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe, that the information in the
    registration statement was true.  Rather than filing their own affidavits
    on the motion, the appellants relied on documentary evidence, legal submissions
    and the affidavit of a senior Livent executive.  The affidavit was found
    by the U.S. motion judge to be deficient in a number of respects, including
    its failure to provide direct evidence of the appellants’ alleged due diligence
    and the affiant’s lack of personal knowledge of the due diligence process.  Apart
    from those deficiencies, the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    motion judge noted that, in any event, “blind reliance on others does not
    substitute for the due diligence that defendants must demonstrate”.  In granting
    summary judgment to the respondents, the U.S. motion judge specifically declined
    to draw an adverse inference against the appellants for their failure to
    provide direct evidence, although it was within his discretion to do so once
    the appellants relied on their U.S. right to silence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants appealed the judgment and the appeal court conducted a hearing <i>de
    novo</i>.  The appeal was unsuccessful.  The appellants later moved to vary
    the judgment on the basis of fresh evidence about due diligence that they
    said arose from witnesses who testified at the Canadian preliminary inquiry
    on the criminal charges.  The appellants were unsuccessful on that motion
    as well as on their further appeal.  Thereafter, the respondents brought
    their successful application for recognition of the U.S. judgment in Ontario.</p>
  <h2>The application judge’s reasons</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    careful reasons, the application judge considered the principles governing
    the recognition of foreign judgments.  He concluded that the appellants had
    failed to establish the defences they argued against recognition; specifically,
    the fraud defence, the natural justice defence and the “new” defence.  The
    appellants do not appeal the rejection of the fraud defence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge provided five reasons for denying the appellants’ natural
    justice and “new” defences.  In doing so, he noted, at para. 40, that the
    common theme of his reasons was that “any constraint on the [appellants’]
    ability to defend themselves in the New York Action resulted from their decision
    not to defend the American criminal proceedings”.  The application judge
    observed that, while the approach to protection against self-incrimination
    differs in the U.S. from the approach in Canada, the decision in <i>United
    States of America v. Levy</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 2298 (S.C.J.), aff’d [2003]
    O.J. No. 56 (C.A.) had determined that the difference did not constitute
    a valid objection to the recognition of the judgment.  He saw no reason to
    distinguish <i>Levy</i> from the facts of this case. </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, while the appellants’ factum challenges the application judge’s rejection
    of both their natural justice and “new”
    category defences, appellants’ counsel opened oral argument by saying there
    was really only one issue:  whether the appellants had been denied the opportunity
    to defend the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    action.  On this issue, the appellants focus not on the U.S. criminal proceedings
    as they did below, but rather on the Canadian criminal charges.  They argue
    on appeal that they were effectively precluded from giving evidence in the
    U.S. civil proceeding because any evidence they gave could have been used
    against them in the Canadian criminal proceedings.  This was the case, they
    say, because the <i>Charter</i> does not apply extraterritorially and thus
    would not have protected their
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    evidence from incriminating them in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Foreign
    judgments are generally recognized on the basis of the rules of comity.  LaForest
    J. described comity in <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>, [1990]
    3 S.C.R. 1077 at 1096 as “grounded in the need in modern times to facilitate
    the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines in a fair and orderly
    manner”, a principle of particular importance in times of increasing transnational
    commerce.  In extending comity to international commerce, Major J. in <i>Beals
    v. Saldanha</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416 adapted the “real and substantial connection” test
    for the recognition of foreign judgments.  There is no question that the
    test was met in this case both because the registration statement named
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York as the appropriate jurisdiction and because the appellants attorned
    to the jurisdiction by participating extensively in that proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Beals</i> also
    established the available defences of fraud, public policy or lack of natural
    justice.  The list of available defences is not closed.  Major J., writing
    for the majority, recognized, at para. 42, that “[u]nusual situations may
    arise that might require the creation of a new defence”.  However, he also
    cautioned, at paras. 41 and 42, that the defences, including any new defences,
    should be applied narrowly.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in addition to their natural justice defence, the appellants argue for a
    new or fourth defence, which they characterize as the loss of a meaningful
    opportunity to be heard.  They say this defence arises from the unusual facts
    of this case, including the outstanding criminal charges in combination with
    the U.S. civil litigation.  In both their natural justice and fourth defence
    arguments, the appellants argue that they would have lost their <i>Charter</i> protection
    against self-incrimination had they testified in the U.S. proceedings.  In
    those circumstances, it would be “contrary to Canadian notions of fundamental
    justice” (<i>Beals</i>, para. 59) to recognize the resulting judgment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the basis for the appellants’ argument rests on the different jurisdictions’ approaches
    to self-incrimination, I begin with Arbour J.’s description, at paras. 21-22,
    in <i>R. v. No</i><i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>ë</span>l</i> (2002), 168 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class=LERQuote1Char><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";font-style:normal'>In
        the United States, a different arrangement is in place:  faced with the
        prospect of self-incrimination, the witness can claim the Fifth Amendment,
        and refuse to provide the incriminating answer.</span></span><span class=LERQuote1Char><span

    …</span></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Under the regime of the <i>Canada Evidence Act,</i> and
    now also under the <i>Charter</i>, a different bargain is struck.  When a
    witness provides evidence in any proceeding, whether voluntarily or under
    legal compulsion, he or she cannot refuse to answer a question that may tend
    to incriminate the witness, but is offered protection against the subsequent
    use of that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant who is facing both civil litigation
    and criminal charges in the U.S. has the option either to waive his or her
    right to silence and to testify in the civil proceeding or to refuse to testify
    and run the risk of an adverse inference.  In
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , the testimony of a person who chooses to testify in a civil proceeding
    cannot be used as part of the prosecution’s case against that person as an
    accused in any later criminal proceeding.  However, any evidence that same
    person voluntarily gives in the civil proceeding may be used to cross-examine
    that person on a prior inconsistent statement should he or she testify as
    an accused at the subsequent criminal trial.  See <i>R. v. Henry</i> (2005),
    202 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Levy</i> is
    the seminal decision regarding the impact of the different approaches on
    the recognition of a U.S. judgment in Ontario.  In that case, the Canadian
    defendants argued that their Fifth Amendment right to silence precluded them
    from testifying in the U.S. summary judgment motion.  The U.S. court in <i>Levy</i> drew
    an adverse inference from the defendants’ failure to testify.  Such an adverse
    inference is available in the U.S. system: <i>Baxter v. Palmigiano</i>, 425
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    308 (1976).  The defendants argued that this violated their Canadian constitutional
    right to silence and rendered recognition of the U.S. judgment against them
    in Canada offensive to our concepts of public policy and natural justice.  I
    note parenthetically that the U.S. court in this case, given the weight of
    the evidence, found it unnecessary to, and accordingly did not, draw an adverse
    inference against the appellants, which made their argument regarding the
    U.S. charges even weaker than the defence raised in <i>Levy</i>. </p>

    any event, on a summary judgment motion in <i>Levy</i>, Campbell J. concluded,
    at para. 30, that the defendants’ argument “overlooks the basic difference
    regarding incrimination in civil as opposed to criminal proceedings, both
    in Canada and the United States”.  Because the principle operates with the
    same result in both Canada and the U.S., an accused is protected against
    self-incrimination in a criminal trial.  After considering the impact of
    the different approaches to self-incrimination for a civil proceeding, Campbell
    J. concluded at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fact that the exercise of the privilege operates
    with some difference in civil actions in each country does not make a different
    application of the privilege in a United States court from the Ontario process
    in any way a bar for recognition here of a United States judgment based on
    the valid exercise of the privilege in the United States.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Campbell
    J. observed that the defendants in <i>Levy</i> were permitted to raise a
    full defence to the civil action.  The fact that they chose to invoke the
    Fifth Amendment, and that the privilege operates differently in the two jurisdictions,
    could not amount to a denial of natural justice.  This court dismissed the
    appeal in one paragraph agreeing with Campbell J. on the “general merits” of
    his disposition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    both their natural justice and meaningful opportunity defences, the appellants
    attempt to distinguish <i>Levy</i> on two bases.  First, they argue that
    since the appellants were criminally charged in Canada, they did not have
    a meaningful choice to defend the U.S. proceedings.  <i>Charter</i> protection
    was not available to them, the appellants say, because the <i>Charter</i> does
    not apply extraterritorially; any evidence they gave in the U.S. could be
    used against them in the Canadian criminal proceeding.  Second, they argue
    that the extent of their self-incrimination would have exceeded the parameters
    found acceptable in <i>Levy</i> because, in this case, it would have been
    necessary for the appellants to give detailed evidence about their due diligence.  Such
    detail would have provided the Canadian prosecution with a virtual discovery
    of the defence position that would have otherwise been unavailable, resulting
    in derivative evidence, and would have caused unfair prejudice.  For the
    reasons that follow, I do not accept either argument.  </p>
  <h2><i>Charter</i> application</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the proposition that their U.S. evidence would have been admissible in the
    Canadian criminal proceeding, the appellants rely on the cases of <i>R. v.
    Harrer</i> (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) and <i>United States of America
    v. Shull</i>,<i> </i><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>[2004] B.C.J. No. 528 (S.C.), which held, in the
    circumstances of those cases, that the <i>Charter</i> did not apply extraterritorially.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Harrer</i> considered
    statements the appellant had made to police in the United States during an
    investigation in that country.  The appellant argued that those statements
    ought to have been excluded from her subsequent Canadian criminal trial because,
    when the focus of their investigation shifted, the U.S. police failed to
    give her the second right-to-counsel warning that is required in Canada.  The
    appellant’s argument in <i>Harrer</i>, that this U.S. failure to comply with
    Canadian law rendered her statements inadmissible in Canada, was rejected
    by the Supreme Court of Canada.  Writing for the majority, LaForest J. held
    that the <i>Charter </i>had no direct application to the interrogation in
    the U.S. because the U.S. authorities were not acting on behalf of any Canadian
    government.  Rather, the <i>Charter</i> was only triggered when Canadian
    police began proceedings on the appellant’s return to Canada.  In any event,
    the court concluded that the admission of the new evidence would not result
    in an unfair trial in the circumstances of that case, although it recognized
    the prospect of exclusion in another case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also relies on <i>Shull</i>.  In that case, the U.S. sought to
    extradite individuals in Canada charged with securities fraud in the U.S.  On
    their extradition hearing, the accused sought to exclude their U.S. depositions
    relying on their s. 13 <i>Charter</i> protection against self-incrimination.  The
    extradition judge reasoned that exclusion of the U.S. statements at the hearing
    in Canada for their extradition to the U.S. would result in an impermissible
    extraterritorial application of the <i>Charter</i>.  Since the evidence in
    an extradition hearing is not tendered to prove guilt, but only to determine
    whether there is sufficient evidence to extradite, it would be wrong to preclude
    U.S. authorities from relying on evidence “gathered in conformity with its
    own procedures that would be admissible in its own jurisdiction” (para. 36).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, neither of these cases assists the appellants.  The decisions reflect
    fundamentally different situations than the one presented in this case.  Neither <i>Harrer</i> nor <i>Shull</i> dealt
    with testimony given in a foreign jurisdiction in a judicial proceeding.  Rather,
    they dealt with the application of the <i>Charter</i> in the criminal context
    in relation to incriminatory statements taken by criminal or quasi-criminal
    enforcement authorities.  The question in those cases was whether the <i>Charter</i> reached
    extraterritorially to the time the statements were taken in the U.S.  That
    is a very different question from the one at issue in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Instead,
    the question in this case is whether any incriminatory statements the appellants
    would have made in the foreign proceeding would have been admissible under
    the <i>Charter</i> at their subsequent Canadian criminal trial.  In my view,
    as I will explain, it would have been open to the appellants to argue in
    their Canadian criminal proceeding that any incriminatory statements made
    in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    civil proceeding should be excluded from evidence either under the <i>Charter </i>or
    under the trial judge’s residual common law discretion to exclude evidence
    in order to ensure a fair trial.</p>
  <h2>(a)       Application of s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    13 of the <i>Charter </i>provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the
    right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate
    that witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury
    or for the giving of contradictory evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application of this section raises two issues in this case: first, whether “proceedings” where
    a witness testifies could include the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    proceedings and, second, when the determination is made that the evidence
    is
    “incriminating”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    in regard to “proceedings”, s. 13 would likely protect the appellants, in
    the context of this criminal proceeding, by protecting any incriminatory
    statements made in the U.S. civil proceeding from being used in the Canadian
    criminal proceeding.  I say this because s. 13 refers broadly to “any proceedings”.  ssuming
    that the appellants’ affidavit and deposition evidence would be considered
    evidence in the U.S. proceeding,<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></a></span> s. 13 may be construed to extend its protection
    to that evidence.  I find support for this position in <i>R. v. Stratton</i>,
    (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 449, which considered s. 12 of the <i>Canada Evidence
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. E-10.  Section 12 provides that a witness may be
    asked whether he (or she) has been “convicted of any offence”.  In <i>Stratton</i>,
    Martin J.A. interpreted this provision to mean that a witness may be asked
    about foreign convictions, provided that the foreign offence “would constitute
    a conviction under Canadian law.”  Applying this reasoning to s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    a witness in any foreign proceeding would be protected against self-incrimination
    to the extent the foreign proceeding would constitute “proceedings” under
    Canadian law.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the time for the determination of whether a statement is “incriminatory” is
    not at the time when the statement was made.  Rather, the relevant time for
    the application of the <i>Charter</i> is at the time of the attempted introduction
    of the statements at the Canadian criminal trial.  This was established by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Dubois</i> (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d)
    513, which specifically considered the <i>Charter’s </i>s. 13 protection
    against self-incrimination.  The sole issue in that case was whether s. 13
    prevented the Crown from adducing testimony given by the appellant in his
    first trial at his second trial on a charge of second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering whether the evidence from the first trial was “incriminating” in
    the second trial, Lamer J., for the majority, concluded, at p. 536, that “s.
    13 does not require that the incriminating character of the evidence be evaluated
    in the first proceedings as well as in the second”; rather, “whether evidence
    is incriminating or not can only be properly assessed at the time it is being
    used in the subsequent proceedings, at the time when the Crown seeks to make
    use of the evidence”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lamer
    J. wrote at p. 533: “As s. 13 guarantees the right of a person against self-incrimination,
    rather than the rights of a witness giving testimony, it inures to an individual
    only at the moment an attempt is made to use previous testimony to incriminate
    its author”.  He confirmed at p. 534 that the “focus of the right is on the
    second proceedings, the time at which the previous testimony is sought to
    be used, rather than the time at which it is given”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows from this that the applicability of the protection depends on whether
    the evidence would be incriminating at the time it is sought to be adduced
    at the criminal trial, not whether it was incriminatory at the time of the
    summary judgment motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the basis of <i>Dubois</i>, it would be open to the appellants to argue that
    the evidence they gave in the U.S. civil proceeding would constitute “incriminating
    evidence”, if and when tendered as part of the Crown’s case, and thus, should
    be excluded pursuant to s. 13 in the Canadian criminal proceeding.  See also <i>R.
    v. Henry</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    decision in <i>R. v. Hape</i> (2007), 220 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.) is helpful
    on this issue.  The court in <i>Hape</i> considered the extraterritorial
    application of the <i>Charter</i> to searches conducted by Canadian officers
    in the Turks and Caicos relying on that jurisdiction’s requirements for a
    legal search.  LeBel J., writing for the majority, held that the <i>Charter</i> did
    not apply to the searches.  Yet he also observed at para. 96: “there is no
    impediment to extraterritorial adjudicative jurisdiction pursuant to which
    evidence gathered abroad may be excluded from a Canadian trial, as this jurisdiction
    simply attaches domestic consequences to foreign events”.  This important
    observation applies to this case.  LeBel J. made it clear, referring to <i>Harrer</i>,
    that the rights of an accused in Canada are still respected at the trial
    stage.  As he said at para. 100: “Where the Crown seeks at trial to adduce
    evidence gathered abroad, the <i>Charter</i> provisions governing trial processes
    in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ensure that the appropriate balance is struck and that due consideration
    is shown for the rights of an accused being investigated abroad.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    I take two things from <i>Hape</i>.  First, <i>Hape</i> supports the reasoning
    in <i>Dubois</i>, that when considering the protection provided by s. 13
    of the <i>Charter</i>, the “timing” of the <i>Charter</i> application is
    concerned with the moment when the incriminating evidence is to be adduced
    at the criminal trial.  Second, the <i>Charter </i>can have “extraterritorial
    adjudicative jurisdiction”
    particularly where the application of that jurisdiction results in purely
    domestic consequences and does not interfere with the jurisdiction of the
    foreign country.  This supports my view that the term “any proceedings” under
    s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i> is not necessarily restricted to a proceeding
    that occurs in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ; a court will have the jurisdiction to consider “any proceedings” in the
    context in which they occurred.  </p>
  <h2>(b)       The exclusion of unfair evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    even if s. 13 protection were not available, it may well inform the appellants’ other
    potential avenues of recourse.  Section 7 provides that: “Everyone has the
    right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
    deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
    justice”.  This has been interpreted to afford rights against self-incrimination
    and rights to a fair trial, thereby supplementing the protections under sections
    11(c), 11(d) and 13 of the <i>Charter</i>.  See <i>R. v. Hebert </i>(1990),
    57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 36 (S.C.C.) (re: right to silence under ss. 11(c) and

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span

    11 provides that: “Any person charged with an offence has the right … (c)
    not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in
    respect of the offence; (d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according
    to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal….”  As
    LeBel J. observed in <i>Hape</i> at para. 100, “[s]ections 7 and 11(d) provide
    that everyone tried in Canada enjoys the same rights to a fair trial and … [to]
    the principles of fundamental justice.”  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span

    an issue regarding whether the principles of fundamental justice and the

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  While LaForest J. concluded that the admission of the impugned evidence
    would not result in an unfair trial in that case, he noted that, if he had
    come to a contrary conclusion, the evidence could have been excluded under
    sections 11(d) or 7.  He wrote at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I should add that, had the circumstances been such
    that the admission of the evidence would lead to an unfair trial, I would
    have …
    [rejected] the evidence on the basis of the trial judge’s duty, now constitutionalized
    by the enshrinement of a fair trial in the Charter, to exercise properly
    his or her judicial discretion to exclude evidence that would result in an
    unfair trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    minority, led by McLachlin J., recognized the same discretion at para. 42,
    but grounded it in the common law or under section 24(1):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In addition to the common law exclusionary power,
    the <i>Charter </i>guarantees the right to a fair trial (s. 11(d)) and provides
    new remedies for breaches of the legal rights accorded to an accused person.
    Evidence obtained in breach of the <i>Charter</i> may only be excluded under
    s. 24(2): <i>R. v. Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481…. Evidence not
    obtained in breach of the <i>Charter</i> but the admission of which may undermine
    the right to a fair trial may be excluded under s. 24(1), which provides
    for &quot;such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the
    circumstances&quot; for <i>Charter</i> breaches. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In describing a “fair trial”, McLachlin
    J. said at para. 45:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At base, a fair trial is a trial that appears fair,
    both from the perspective of the accused and the perspective of the community.…A
    fair trial is one which satisfies the public interest in getting at the truth,
    while preserving basic procedural fairness to the accused.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    grounded under the majority’s view of the accused’s right to a fair trial
    under sections 11(d) or 7 or under the minority’s reliance on the common
    law or section 24(1), the court in <i>Harrer</i> agreed that evidence, even
    when not obtained in breach of the <i>Charter</i>, may be excluded by the
    trial judge in the interests of a fair trial.  Accordingly, it would be open
    to the appellants, if appropriate, to have the evidence excluded from the
    Canadian criminal trial on these bases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants take issue with the high threshold they argue is necessary to
    obtain a s. 7 or s. 11(d) exclusion.  They point to the description by McLachlin
    J. in <i>Harrer</i> as arising when the admission of the proffered evidence
    would “be so grossly unfair as to repudiate the values” of our system (para.
    51).  This threshold was adopted in <i>Hape</i> at para. 111.  In the result,
    on a <i>Charter</i> challenge, an accused would be required to establish
    a <i>Charter</i> breach and the exclusion of the evidence as grossly unfair
    on a balance of probabilities.  However, separate from the <i>Charter</i>,
    a trial judge has a residual common law discretion to exclude evidence, a
    discretion that is not restricted to, albeit most often invoked in, situations
    where the prejudicial effect of the evidence would outweigh its probative
    value.  See <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9.  The discretion also extends
    to situations where the admission of the evidence would result in an unfair
    trial.  See <i>R. v. Potvin</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525.  Accordingly, an accused
    is not constrained by the high exclusionary threshold established by <i>Hape</i>.  In
    those circumstances, whether the hypothetical evidence actually compromised
    trial fairness would be for the trial judge in the Canadian criminal proceedings
    to determine on a full record.</p>

    appellants argue that a fourth category or defence should be added to the

    opportunity to defend.  In my view, as aptly identified by the application
    judge, the considerations raised by the appellants under the proposed new
    category are the same considerations as under the rubric of the natural justice
    defence.  I would not give effect to the appellants’ arguments on this issue.</p>

    appellants also argue that they would have been required to give significantly
    detailed evidence to assert their due diligence defence in the civil proceeding,
    from which the Crown could have obtained incriminatory derivative evidence
    for use in the criminal proceeding.  However, I cannot accept that this changes
    the result.  <a name="_Hlk201570965">Apart from the fact that any </a>evidence
    led by the appellants likely would be exculpatory at their criminal trial,
    the appellants could move in the criminal proceeding to exclude any derivative
    evidence that was incriminating.  See <i>R. v. Feeney</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R.
    13; <i>R. v. Stillman</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607.  In addition, the same potential
    would arise whether the appellants gave their civil evidence in Canada or
    in the U.S.  In either case, the admissibility of both the direct and any
    derivative evidence and whether it would have compromised trial fairness
    or fundamental justice would be considered by the trial judge in the Canadian
    criminal proceeding.  </p>
  <h2>Comity</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude by adopting the reasoning of the application judge regarding the
    implications on the principle of comity at para. 67:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Finally, I have also considered briefly
      the policy issues presented by this proceeding, which the respondents characterize,
      in accordance with the principles articulated in <i>Beals</i> at para.
      40, as the balance between order, being the importance of international
      comity in the context of international cross-border transactions, and fairness
      to Canadian citizens. Given the satisfaction of the standards of fairness
      required in <i>Beals </i>in this proceeding, the policy of comity compels
      enforcement of the New York Judgment. The respondents participated in a
      transaction to their financial benefit that was conducted in the capital
      markets of the United States. It is not unreasonable to be subject to criminal
      and civil proceedings in the United States if a material misrepresentation
      in the Registration Statement causes loss to investors. On its own, I think
      this is a very strong public policy element in favour of enforcing the
      New York Judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    principles of order and fairness that drive the rules of comity and the recognition
    of foreign judgments apply in this case.  Since the appellants chose to do
    business and file a registration statement with the U.S. authorities, it
    is hardly unfair or disorderly to recognize the resulting civil judgment
    arising from their misrepresentations in this statement.  This is particularly
    so when any adverse effect of any consequences regarding the potential for
    self-incrimination can be resolved in the criminal trial.  It cannot be that
    individuals such as the appellants can avoid civil liability for their misdeeds
    simply because they also face criminal charges in both jurisdictions.  Such
    a result would be contrary to the principles of order and fairness.</p>

    would dismiss the appeal.  The respondents are entitled to their costs fixed
