      a trial before a judge without a jury, the appellant was convicted as a
      party to the offence of sexual assault with a weapon (a bottle).  He was
      sentenced to twenty-six months imprisonment, which was reduced to a reformatory
      term of two years less a day because of pre-trial custody.  He appeals
      his conviction and sentence. </span></p>

      charge arose out of an assault that occurred at the appellant’s parents’ home
      in the early morning of
    <st1:date
Year="2004" Day="11" Month="6" w:st="on">
    June 11, 2004<a name="_ftnref1"></a>.  The evidence established that while
    the appellant kissed and fondled the victim, S.K., on the appellant’s bed,
    two other young men removed S.K.’s underwear and penetrated her vagina, first
    digitally and then with two bottles.  This horrific assault stopped when
    S.K. was able to move away when the two other men began to shave her pubic
    hair with an electric shaver. </span></p>

      trial judge convicted the appellant after finding that he was satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant engaged in sexual activity
      with S.K., without her consent, in concert with the other two men who were
      the principal offenders. </span></p>

      for the appellant argued two grounds of appeal:&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>i)         The trial judge erred in law in failing
    to discuss the defence of intoxication; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ii)        The trial judge erred in applying a different
    level of scrutiny to the Crown evidence than to the defence evidence.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>June
      10, 2004 was the appellant’s nineteenth birthday.  A party was held at
      his parent’s home in Hagersville.  The party goers, mostly high school
      students, ranged in age from fifteen to nineteen.  Drinking was heavy.  Marijuana
      was consumed. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>As
      the night wore on the numbers thinned and the party gravitated to the appellant’s
      bedroom. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>S.K.
      arrived at the party around 11:00 p.m. Almost immediately, the appellant
      supplied her with a number of strong drinks.  She consumed these drinks
      over the course of a few hours.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>At
      some point in the early morning hours of June 11, 2004, S.K. and the appellant
      started kissing heavily on the appellant’s bed.  S.K. lay across the width
      of the appellant’s bed with her legs dangling over the edge.  The appellant
      lay lengthwise on the bed more or less on top of S.K.  There, in the room
      with several other young men present, the appellant kissed and fondled
      S.K. for some time. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It
      was then that the sexual assault with the bottles took place.  While the
      appellant kissed and fondled S.K., two young men, J.H. and D.F. (young
      offenders) began to “take their liberties” with S.K.  After they removed
      her underwear, they penetrated her digitally and then with a beer bottle.  Not
      satisfied, they began to use a larger bottle.  Around this point, another
      party goer, who had just entered the room, witnessed S.K. saying “stop”.  He
      told the appellant and the other two young men to stop. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>After
      this good samaritan left the room, the assault continued.  The abuse did
      not end until J.H. brought in a pair of hair clippers and started to shave
      S.K.’s pubic hair.  At this point, S.K., who had repeatedly asked that
      they stop, was able to move away and the sexual activity stopped.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Around
    the start of the sexual activity, S.K. had blacked out.  Her last recollection
    was sitting on the appellant’s bed with another party goer.  Her next memory
    was waking up the following morning on the couch in the appellant’s room.  She
    was wearing the appellant’s basketball shorts and was covered in vomit.  She
    observed hickeys on her neck, chest and breasts.  Some of her pubic hair
    had been shaved, and she experienced a tender feeling inside her vagina.  She
    testified, “It felt like someone had intercourse with me, and I didn’t know
    who”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    asked the appellant what happened, and he said he did not know.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.’s
    aunt picked her up and took her to the hospital where she had a complete
    examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Over
    time, S.K. recalled a small portion of the evening’s events.  She remembered
    that at some point during the activity on the bed she tried to move her left
    hand down past her waist but that she felt weak, as if she could not do anything.  She
    also remembered crying and saying
    “No”.  <span style='"Times New Roman"'>She further remembered the appellant
    saying, “I don’t give a fuck and I don’t give a shit.”  She did not know
    what the appellant’s comment related to, but it seemed to S.K. to correspond
    to the point in time when she vomited. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      evidence clearly established that alcohol and drugs were readily available
      at the party.  The appellant had a lot of beer and hard liquor in his bedroom,
      party goers brought additional alcohol, the appellant’s mother supplied “Jell-O
      shooters”, and marijuana was present.  But what was the evidence as to
      the appellant’s actual state of intoxication?  A number of people testified
      about this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    Shawn Hill, a friend of the appellant’s, arrived at the birthday party at
    about 10:00 p.m., and after sitting around for an hour and a half, he consumed
    four shots, a couple of beers, and two marijuana joints in forty-five minutes.  As
    an indication of how Hill assessed individuals’ degree of intoxication, on
    a scale of one to ten with ten being “falling down drunk”,
    “completely out of it” and “passed out drunk”, Hill estimated his own level
    of intoxication as a six – or “just feeling drunkenness”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hill
    testified that the appellant drank <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>a great deal of alcohol and smoked some marijuana.</span>  Hill
    placed the appellant at a nine on the ten-point scale in terms of level of
    intoxication; in contrast to S.K.,  to whom Hill gave an eight or nine out
    of ten.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Levi Opheim, a long time friend of the appellant’s, testified that the appellant
    was drinking throughout the night and that he was slurring his words, very
    sloppy and zoned – “very drunk”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Third,
      the evidence of Terry Wood, another friend of the appellant’s, was that
      the appellant was “drunk”. </span></p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,

      trial judge, after a detailed review of the evidence and an analysis that
      involved assessing the credibility of the witnesses, summarized his findings
      concerning the appellant’s involvement in the assault as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I accept, and find it as a fact, that Mr. Wobbes
    was aware of and condoned, even took part in, the common enterprise of fondling
    Ms. “X”.  He was aware of the bottles being used, I find.  He was aware that
    she said stop repeatedly, and he did not stop but continued to fondle or
    grope her with the other boys.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the court’s view, he had to know and see what
    the others were doing to her body.  He was but inches away and busy fondling
    her himself.  It defies all logic and reason to think otherwise.  I find
    as a fact, that he was aware of and took an active part in the fondling that
    took place over the young woman’s body, and that he did not stop when repeatedly
    told by Ms. “X” to do so.  As well, I am satisfied that the three boys intended
    to fondle and abuse Ms. “X”
    together.  Mr. Wobbes, I find as a fact, aided and abetted in, by distracting
    Ms. “X” knowing this would assist his friends in also abusing her lower body.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>After
      making these findings of fact, the trial judge turned to the issue of whether
      the appellant was a party to the offence of sexual assault with a weapon,
      as provided in s. 272(1)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
      C-46.<i> </i> He found that there was a sexual assault with a weapon by
      J.H. and D.F., and that S.K. did not consent both because she was incapable
      of doing so and because even if she had initially agreed to the activities,
      her repeated requests to stop demonstrated a lack of agreement to continue:
      see s. 273.1(2)(b) and (e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.<i> </i> As well,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he requirement of reasons is tied to their purpose

    of the correctness of the decision (which embraces both errors of law and
    palpable overriding errors of fact). If deficiencies in the reasons do not,
    in a particular case, foreclose meaningful appellate review, but allow for
    its full exercise, the deficiency will not justify intervention.</p>

    ), <i>Sheppard</i> and <i>Braich </i>introduced<i> </i>a new genre of argument
    based on inadequacies in trial judges’ reasons.  On this new argument, inadequacies
    in reasons are sufficient to justify reversal in their own right without
    inferring any underlying legal error from those inadequacies and without
    finding that the verdict is unreasonable, provided meaningful appellate review
    is foreclosed.  In other words, the absence of reasons or seriously inadequate
    reasons can constitute a freestanding error of law, which justifies quashing
    a verdict.</span></p>

      functional test, considered in the context of the specific case.  If, taken
      contextually, it can be said that the inadequacy in the reasons deprives
      the appellant of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly understood
      and therefore scrutinized, then the deficiency may justify appellate intervention.  As
      one example, the Court stated at para. 46:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]here … there are conflicting theories for why

      segues to the core of the appellant’s argument on this ground of appeal.
      The trial judge’s lack of reasoning with respect to the defence of intoxication
      suggests either that the trial judge did not consider the defence or that
      he considered it and found that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.  The
      former scenario would constitute reversible error because a trial judge
      must consider any defence with an air of reality.  It follows that the
      inability to distinguish between the two scenarios because of the lack

      answer is found in the paragraph in the decision referred to in paragraph

      continued groping S.K. to help the other two perpetrators in their assault
      with the beer bottles and ultimately the clippers, he went on to hold that
      the appellant, as well as the others, had the intention to go further with

      a charge of being a party to an offence under s. 21(1)(b) or (c) of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>.  The Court explained that “[B]efore a person can be reasonably
      said to have abetted another in the commission of an offence, he must know
      or understand what he is abetting even though he might not know or understand
      that it is an offence, and on the basis of this knowledge or understanding
      must decide whether to abet the other person’s actions.  From a practical
      point of view, I think that drunkenness would be a defence under s. 21(1)(c)
      only if a person were so intoxicated as to be incapable of any understanding

      he did not have the benefit of argument on this issue as the defence of
      intoxication in relation to the <i>mens rea</i> element of the offence

      disagree with these criticisms of the trial judge’s reasoning.  His thorough
      reasons, read as a whole, demonstrate that he carefully and objectively
      examined the evidence of all of the witnesses.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      example, in certain respects, there was a conflict between the evidence
      of  Opheim and Hill and that of D.F. and J.H..  In the face of this conflict
      the trial judge observed that, at trial, the co-accused denied facts that
      they earlier agreed to in the context of their guilty pleas.  Specifically,
      D.F. denied any participation in the assault until he finally admitted
      to having removed the complainant’s underwear.  J.H. gave evidence that
      suggested that the complainant effectively consented to the activity in
      issue.  The trial judge was entitled to take these serious contradictions
      into account in his assessment of the co-accuseds’ evidence and ultimately
      in his decision to prefer the evidence of Opheim and Hill. </span></p>

      respect to Wood’s evidence, in addition to the benefits the trial judge
      had in observing and listening to the various witnesses who testified as
      to what took place at the appellant’s birthday party, he assessed Wood’s
      evidence against the backdrop of his evidence that he did not see anything
      wrong with what transpired in the bedroom on the basis that “group sex
      is not illegal” and on the basis of internal inconsistencies in his testimony.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      respect to the remainder of the concerns upon which the appellant relies
      in relation to the trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence, some areas
      upon which the appellant relies are not material (such as whether and when
      the bedroom door was open or closed and/or locked at any given time) and
      in other aspects (such as whether the appellant fondled S.K. when J.H.
      left the bedroom to get the clippers) the evidence varied, as it frequently
      does, depending on the perspective of the witness who was able to give
      evidence on the point.</span></p>

  <h2>E.        CONCLUSION REGARDING CONVICTION APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      trial judge’s reasons allowed for effecting appellate review.  His reasons
      permitted this court to assure itself that the trial judge had properly
      apprehended the relevant evidence, applied the proper legal principles
      to that evidence, particularly the <i>mens rea</i> aspect of the charge,
      made findings of credibility that were available to him on the evidence,
      and ultimately reached a verdict based on the evidence and the application
      of the relevant legal principles to that evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>I
      would therefore dismiss the appeal as to conviction.</span></p>
  <h2>F.        SENTENCE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant applies for leave to appeal from his sentence.  If leave is granted,
    he seeks to have his sentence reduced and converted to a conditional sentence.  The
    appellant submits that, the application of proper sentencing principles to
    the facts of this case and taking into consideration the principle of parity,
    a conditional sentence of 12 to 18 months is appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    start by expressing my view that the sentence is fit having regard to the
    principles of sentencing and their application to the circumstances of the
    offence and the offender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    need not repeat the circumstances of this horrific assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    to the offender, the sentencing judge properly took into consideration a
    number of mitigating factors.  The appellant is a 23 year old first offender.  The
    evidence called at the sentencing hearing demonstrated that he enjoyed a
    reputation of being caring, loyal and coming from a supportive family. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    add here that the fresh evidence submitted to this court for the purpose
    of the sentencing appeal demonstrates that the appellant has, since the time
    of the assault, led what may be called an exemplary life.  He has studied
    full-time at the Niagara College of Canada, obtained employment, volunteered
    at his church, and assisted his grandmother who has serious medical problems.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge properly considered the circumstances of the offence and
    the offender in light of appropriate sentencing principles.  T<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>rue, the personal circumstances of the appellant, then
    and now paint a positive picture.  He is to be commended for the steps he
    has taken to move on with his life in a law abiding and productive manner.  However,
    the circumstances of the offence –
    the public degradation of a young woman unable to defend herself – are serious. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    basis of the parity argument is the fact that each of the co-accused received
    a non-custodial sentence of 18 months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary difficulty the appellant faces in relying on the parity argument
    is that the co-accused were young offenders sentenced under the regime established
    under the <i>Youth Criminal Justice
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Act<span
 style='font-style:normal'> </span>
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C. 2002, c.1 </i>(“<i>YCJA</i>”) – a regime completely different from that
    established under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Most notably the sentencing
    principles of general deterrence found in s. 718(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> are not applicable under the <i>YCJA.</i>  Furthermore, the <i>YCJA</i> places
    mandatory restrictions on the use of custodial sentences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the impact of the operation of these two distinct regimes on
    the disparity between the sentences of the appellant and his co-accused,
    another factor that explains the difference between the sentences is the
    fact that the co-accused pled guilty and they were therefore entitled to
    rely upon that important mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no basis on which to interfere with the sentence.&nbsp; It is within
    the range for similar offences and reveals no error in principle.&nbsp;  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
