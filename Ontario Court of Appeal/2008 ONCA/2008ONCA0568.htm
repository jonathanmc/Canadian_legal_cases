line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    the appellant’s trial for first degree murder before Belleghem J. and a jury,
    the central issues were whether the death of the deceased was accidental
    or intentional and whether it was planned and deliberate.  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge erred in two respects that went to the core
    of those issues.  One alleged error concerns the treatment of expert evidence
    as to the cause of death.  The other error concerns the use of some unusual
    bad character evidence as similar fact evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      I
    agree that the trial judge erred with respect to both issues and I would
    therefore order a new trial.</p>

      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    case originates in the appellant’s various attempts to make money through
    the purchase and sale of contraband.  In the 1990s the deceased, Stephen
    Andreopoulos, was involved in the sale first of contraband cigarettes and
    then contraband liquor.  His partners in this latter venture were Dominic
    Sacco and Jim Pearson.  The business was very profitable and the three men
    were interested in finding a better supply of contraband liquor.  A friend
    of the appellant’s, Mark Bonnell, purchased liquor from the deceased’s group
    and they asked him if he knew of a better supplier.  They offered him a finder’s
    fee for his help.  Bonnell in turn asked the appellant if he knew of a supplier.  The
    appellant approached a number of people including Mike Fontaine, who lived
    in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cornwall and had contacts with people in the nearby First Nations reserve. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant testified that he wanted to purchase 500 cases of liquor a month
    from Fontaine, with the first delivery to take place in early July 1996.  According
    to Fontaine, however, the proposed deal was for cigarettes. Fontaine also
    testified that the appellant told him the money for the purchase would be
    supplied by his partner and offered to hire Fontaine to kill his partner,
    the money man.  When Fontaine refused, the appellant asked him to supply
    a gun and stated he would kill his partner himself.  The appellant denied
    there was any such conversation.  In any event, Fontaine decided not to deal
    with the appellant, although it seems that he did not tell the appellant
    of this decision until early July 1996.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    planning for the purchase from Fontaine took place around the end of June
    1996.  There were two meetings and several telephone calls involving the
    various confederates.  The appellant told Sacco, Pearson and the deceased
    that they were to supply a truck to hold 500 cases and provide $50,000 in
    cash.  The appellant told them that the Hell’s Angels were involved and no
    weapons were to be taken along.  He also claimed that corrupt police officers
    would provide security.  When the deceased’s group was unable to come up
    with a vehicle, the appellant arranged to rent a U-haul truck.  The appellant
    told the owner of the rental company that someone else would be driving.  The
    appellant also told Sacco that they could store the liquor at his family’s
    farm in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Milton.  The purchase was to take place on July 2, 1996.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant testified that on the morning of July 2, he decided to steal two
    trees from a job site where he had worked as a backhoe operator.  Accordingly,
    he drove to the site with a van and trailer in the early morning, and loaded
    the trees onto the trailer using a backhoe at the site.  Each tree was about
    eight feet tall in addition to its roots, which were wrapped in a burlap
    and steel tree ball measuring about three feet across.  The appellant then
    went to his uncle’s farm, where he left the trailer with the trees.  He returned
    home from where he called Fontaine.  The appellant testified that until that
    morning when Fontaine told him there would be no deal, he believed the plan
    to obtain the contraband liquor was going to proceed.  According to the appellant,
    at this point he decided that rather than call the deal off, he would steal
    the money that his confederates would be bringing to purchase the liquor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Around
    3:00 p.m., the appellant, Sacco and the deceased met at the U-Haul dealer.  The
    deceased rented the truck while Sacco entered the front passenger seat of
    the appellant’s car.  At trial, there was a dispute about the whereabouts
    of the money.  The appellant claimed that Sacco and later the deceased maintained
    control of the $50,000.  However, Sacco testified that after he had rented
    the truck, the deceased came to the appellant’s car and emptied the money
    into a gym bag lying in the back seat.  In any event, after the truck was
    rented, the appellant drove away in his car with the deceased following in
    the truck; Sacco did not accompany them.  As they approached Highway 400,
    the appellant pulled over and pretended to speak on his cell phone.  He then
    told the deceased that they were going to stop at his family’s farm in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Milton to pick up a trailer to help transport the liquor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was the only witness to the events at the farm.  He testified that
    as he was using the backhoe to remove the trees from the trailer, one of
    the tree balls accidentally struck the deceased.  The deceased fell to the
    ground and the appellant went over to help him.  The deceased’s t-shirt was
    covered with blood and he was gasping for air.  He then went limp.  The appellant
    testified that he panicked; he felt that no one would believe the death was
    an accident, especially since he was planning to steal the money from the
    deceased.  He picked up the body with the backhoe and took it to a remote
    part of the farm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant tried to get hold of his uncle, but without success.  He testified
    that he then went home and returned to the farm with his fiancée.  He retrieved
    the money from the truck and gave it to his fiancée.  He used the backhoe
    to bury the body.  He then drove the rental truck to a parking lot where
    he abandoned it and drove home with his fiancée.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            Over
    the next few days the appellant spent almost the whole $50,000.  He testified
    that he told his family and friends that he had won the money in the lottery.  The
    evidence indicated that at the time the appellant had been in serious financial
    difficulties with large debts.  He did not have a steady job and had debts
    of about $17,000. In particular, he had a loan for almost $9,000 that had
    been co-signed by a friend, Ralph Valente, and Valente was pressing him to
    pay the loan.  The appellant used the money to pay off the various debts
    and to purchase a new truck, which he had arranged to purchase on July l.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the next week, the appellant lied to his confederates and the deceased’s
    wife about what had happened.  For example, he told them that the deceased
    was being held by the police or by bikers.  At some point he told Valente
    that bikers had shot and killed the deceased and then paid him $50,000 to
    bury the body.  Eventually, the deceased’s wife reported to the police that
    her husband was missing.  However, neither she nor the deceased’s partners
    told the police the whole story.  In February 1997, Sacco finally told the
    police about the liquor deal and the appellant’s involvement.  At that point,
    the appellant became the prime suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police interviewed the appellant in February 1997, but he denied knowing
    the deceased or Sacco and tried to focus the police on Bonnell.  In other
    conversations with the investigating officers the appellant suggested that
    bikers and Fontaine might be involved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1997, the police began to resort to a number of strategies to obtain evidence
    against the appellant and, in particular, to try to have him direct them
    to the body of the deceased.  For example, undercover police officers posing
    as bikers told the appellant’s wife and brother-in-law that he owed them
    money.  The police also set up listening devices in the appellant’s home
    and then tried various strategies to spark conversations.  In one of the
    conversations, the appellant’s brother-in-law confronted the appellant about
    the deceased’s disappearance.  The appellant gave evasive answers to the
    questions from his brother-in-law. He never told his family about the alleged
    accident with the tree ball. Further, although on his story his fiancée knew
    about the accidental killing, her statements on the intercepts seem inconsistent
    with his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    most ambitious strategy employed by the police involved an undercover police
    officer, Detective Ken Watson, and what came to be called the “Stewart plot”,
    a variation on the “Mr. Big” scenario.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  On August 2, 1997, Watson befriended the appellant
    and portrayed himself as someone involved in illegal activities.  The appellant
    made a number of incriminating remarks about the death of the deceased including
    a claim that he had received $200,000 out of an illegal alcohol deal and
    that the deceased had “opened his mouth” to the police and so “we did him
    in”.  The appellant did not deny making the various statements attributed
    to him but claimed that he knew Watson was a police officer and was just
    leading him on to try and get information “to find out what they were up
    to”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 26, 1997, Watson and the appellant went to the airport to meet Watson’s “boss”,
    another undercover officer named Bill Campbell.  They went to a hotel room
    where
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell asked the appellant if he would do a “hit”.  The appellant said
    he had never killed anyone and was not prepared to.  He did talk about how
    he had been involved in an illicit liquor deal with Fontaine and that the
    deceased was now missing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the meeting with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Campbell, Watson urged the appellant to become involved, saying that they
    could make up to $200,000.  He said that the “hit” involved someone named
    Stewart who had shown disrespect to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell. Watson said his main concern was getting rid of the body.  The
    appellant told him it could be done if the killing was planned out properly.  The
    appellant agreed to keep talking to Watson about the plot.  The appellant
    suggested they could subcontract the killing, but Watson said they should
    do it themselves to keep the $200,000. Watson also mentioned that Stewart
    had lots of money around his house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    September 1997, the appellant was taking an active role in the planning of
    Stewart’s murder.  He said that Watson’s boss would have to supply them with
    handguns with silencers.  He suggested various ways to dispose of the body
    such as weighing it down and putting it in the lake, but indicated they were
    not to plan ahead of time where to dispose of the body. He also suggested
    dissolving the body with acid, although he cautioned that if they used acid
    they would have to knock out the victim’s teeth first.  He also said they
    would need a rental car that was in neither of their names and showed him
    some licence plates he had that they could use.  He said he would do the
    killing while Watson searched for money in the victim’s home.  He also suggested
    they wrap up the body in a plastic bag and place it in a marshy area where
    animals would consume it.  They would also burn the clothes that they had
    used during the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also suggested that they entice the victim into thinking they were
    selling him cocaine.  They would offer to make the sale for a much reduced
    price; it would be an offer Stewart could not refuse. In that way, the victim
    would have a large quantity of money on hand, which they would steal after
    the killing.  This would alleviate the problem of having to search through
    the victim’s home looking for money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Watson
    asked the appellant if there was “heat” from the last thing he did.  The
    appellant reassured Watson.  He said that “people cleaned up afterwards”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near
    the end of September 1997, the appellant and Watson again met with

    Campbell. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell was pressing him to provide evidence that he could be trusted and
    again asked him if he had killed anyone.  The appellant said he had killed
    someone at the side of the road using a gun and had buried the body.  He
    said he would do the same with this one.  Later, Watson questioned the appellant
    about whether he was being honest with him about the
    “last time”.  The appellant told him about flyers that had been put out when
    the deceased went missing; he said he had one at home and would give it to
    Watson.  He told Watson that it had happened on July 2 of the previous year.
    He referred to the deceased by name as the person he killed.  As well, he
    named his “partners”, “Steve Dominic and Jim Dominic”. He said nobody knew
    he did it “but me and my connection”.</p>

    Campbell was not satisfied that the appellant had previously killed someone

    because he was being watched but eventually agreed to lead them to the body.  Later
    that day, the appellant drove by his uncle’s farm but he did not stop; he
    later told Watson that he had been followed.  Watson told the appellant the
    murder was off because the appellant had not provided the requisite proof.</p>

    Bullock and Ferris testified that the vast majority of unexplained deaths

    include minor lesions in the fine arteries, a blockage or tumour in the conducting
    system or <i>commotio cordis</i>.  <i>Commotio cordis</i> became the focus
    of the defence theory of cause of death.  It is a sudden cardiac death associated
    with an impact to the chest area.  It was the defence theory that the accidental
    striking of the deceased in the chest area with the tree ball caused the
    deceased’s death through the <i>commotio cordis </i>mechanism.  According
    to Dr. Ferris, while <i>commotio cordis</i> is extremely rare, it is a relatively
    probable conclusion where there is an impact to the chest and no other discernable
    cause of death.</p>

    the early part of a lengthy jury charge, the trial judge accurately summarized
    the medical evidence.  He reviewed Dr. Bullock’s evidence at length, including
    quoting from his testimony about the significance of Mr. Moftah’s finding
    respecting carbon monoxide in the spleen.  After this lengthy review he accurately
    summarized the effect of Dr. Bullock’s evidence in these words:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Dr. Bullock]
    said basically he could draw no conclusion from the fact that Mr. Moftah
    had found carbon-monoxide in the spleen.  He described various ways that

    in which we live and smoking.</p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the trial judge accurately summarized the evidence of Dr. Ferris, including
    his agreement with Dr. Bullock that there was nothing to suggest death by
    carbon monoxide.  However, that part of the charge also contained this potentially
    misleading statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Dr. Ferris]
    was not prepared to agree with Mr. Moftah.  He said that he could not say
    that carbon-monoxide was not the cause of death, or not a factor in death.  His
    view was that the fact that carbon-monoxide was present when in a level beyond
    interpretation, that one could not say whether or not it was the cause of
    death.  He said in essence there’s no evidential foundation for either.</p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standing
    on its own, this statement suggests that there was some support in Mr. Moftah’s
    testimony for the view that carbon monoxide was a possible cause of death.  Mr.
    Moftah gave no such evidence.  In answer to a direct question from Crown
    counsel as to whether he could say whether or not carbon monoxide was a factor
    in the death, Mr. Moftah said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Of course I
    cannot, and I did that in my report.  I did say in my report carbon-monoxide
    was detected and I did say in my report that accurate determination of carbon-monoxide
    was not possible due to the condition of the submitted sample.  So my report
    was clear enough.</p>

    Moftah went on to explain in answers to questions from Crown counsel, the

    was a factor in the death.  In particular, in answer to a question from the
    trial judge he stated that he could not say what the actual level of carbon
    monoxide was in the body
    “because we thought it potentially could be misleading.  Could be a lot lower

    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem with the charge to the jury began when the trial judge invited counsel
    at the end of the second day of the charge to voice any objections to his
    directions that they had to that point.  Crown counsel (not Mr. Finley) submitted
    that the charge on the medical evidence was “significantly unbalanced”.  One
    of Crown counsel’s objections was that the trial judge had not summarized
    Mr. Moftah’s evidence.  Initially, the trial judge was alive to the possibility
    that Mr. Moftah’s evidence was a “red herring” since, as he understood it,
    the Crown’s position was not that the deceased died from carbon monoxide
    poisoning.  Crown counsel confirmed that this was their position but then
    took the position that this was not “truly a negative autopsy” because of
    the finding of carbon monoxide.  It was the Crown’s position that <i>commotio
    cordis</i> was not available as a cause of death except where there is a
    negative autopsy.  At the beginning, it appeared that Crown counsel simply
    wanted the trial judge to remind the jury that the fact that cause of death
    was undetermined was a function of the fact that the autopsy took place eighteen
    months after death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s initial position in response to the Crown objections was correct.  He
    was alive to the distinction between proof in a criminal case and what medical
    science can establish.  He was leery about referring to Mr. Moftah’s evidence
    in a way that would suggest that it had some evidentiary value.  For example,
    he said the following to Crown counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The difficulty
    is from a language standpoint, the concept that it can’t be excluded as a
    cause, suggests that it can be included but it can’t be included legally
    if you’re not saying that you want it included.  Like, in other words, you’re
    medically correct and legally wrong.…  This is court, this isn’t [a] medical

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    however, in the continuing dialogue between the trial judge and Crown counsel
    and then defence counsel, the value of the finding of carbon monoxide became
    distorted.  In fact, defence counsel (not Mr. Snell) significantly contributed
    to the confusion by stating that this was a “classic example of experts conflicting,
    having conflicting evidence on an area, that’s not unusual”.  In fact, on
    the significance of carbon monoxide there was no conflict: it had no evidentiary
    value.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel, however, continued to insist that the carbon monoxide finding was
    significant.  For example, Crown counsel said this to the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not see,
    sir, how it can be put any plainer than Your Honour can quote myself many
    times in this trial as saying, the Crown does not suggest or insinuate that
    carbon-monoxide was a cause or the factor in the death of Steven Andreopoulos.  It
    entirely goes to the methodology and evidential foundation for Dr. Ferris
    and Dr. Forbath.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am perfectly
    content that you uncategorically indicate that the Crown again does not suggest
    it is, but it is an important underpinning to their opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually,
    the trial judge became convinced that there was a dispute amongst the experts
    and that he had to refer to the finding of carbon monoxide.  When he resumed
    his charge to the jury the following day, the trial judge reviewed Mr. Moftah’s
    evidence and then set up a conflict between the experts based on that evidence.  The
    trial judge charged the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The presence
    of carbon-monoxide detected by Mr. Moftah, because he categorized it as a
    toxin, was a factor, in his opinion, that he could not rule it in or out.
    What, you may ask, is the significance of this?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown has
    never suggested for a moment that this was a carbon-monoxide death. Nor does
    it argue that it played a part in the death. The presence of carbon-monoxide
    is central however, to the difference in opinion between the Crown and defence
    experts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The theory of
    the defence experts is that this could have been a <i>commotio cordis</i> death.
    This could support the notion of accident. The Crown expert and the defence
    experts disagree on whether this can be tendered as a possible diagnosis.
    Both Crown and defence agree the approach to the diagnosis is by the process
    of elimination. <i>Commotio cordis</i> is obviously agreed to be rare.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The final mechanism
    of death is by ventricular fibrillation, it is postulated. However, ventricular
    fibrillation is the final mechanism of most deaths. How do you diagnose <i>commotio
    cordis</i> as the mechanism that triggers ventricular fibrillation in cases
    such as we have here, undetermined argued by the Crown on the basis of Dr.
    Bullock’s autopsy, or as defence argues, sudden and unexplained death.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, the different
    labels spring from the different views of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, my understanding
    of the evidence is that <i>commotio cordis</i> is so rare and so [elusive]
    in leaving evidence of its existence, that it can only be tendered as a possible
    cause if preconditions are met: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Natural
    causes must be ruled out. Dr. Bullock did that.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    must be evidence of a blow to the chest.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Now, saying
      natural causes are ruled out we move on to the other two premises. The
      other two premises are the source of debate. Dr. Bullock says since carbon-monoxide
      was found, even though it cannot be quantified, it cannot be ruled out.
      It is a toxin and, therefore, is a factor needing to be ruled out. Therefore,
      premise number two is lacking and thereafter commotio cordis is not a tenable
      proposition here</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown argues,
    in addition, that the evidence of the blow to the chest required for the
    diagnosis of <i>commotio cordis</i>, is not reliable. The accused’s story
    is either a lie, the Crown argues, or so tenuous as to not afford any support
    for the needed premise to make the tentative diagnosis of <i>commotio cordis</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dr. Ferris says
    that if you cannot quantify the carbon-monoxide, you cannot say it could
    be a factor and you can, therefore, ignore it in making the possible diagnosis
    of <i>commotio cordis</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dr. Forbath
    did not seem to be aware of the carbon-monoxide issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Dr. Bullock
      says you cannot ignore it</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, all of
    this relates to the defence of accident, and this is what we are talking
    about.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown has
    to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not an accident. The defence
    can tender evidence from which to argue you should have a reasonable doubt.
    You can either find that it was an accident or at least cause you to have
    a reasonable doubt on the issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defence
    does not have to prove anything. It does not have to prove it was an accident.
    Obviously, however, the stronger the evidence on the issue of accident that
    favours the defence, the more it can argue that it has raised a reasonable
    doubt on the issue. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    will begin with the misstatement of the evidence.  On my review of the record
    there was no dispute among the experts about the relevance of carbon monoxide.
    Based on Mr. Moftah’s findings, it was not possible to determine that carbon
    monoxide played any part in the death of the deceased.  This is what the
    jury should have been told if any further reference to carbon monoxide was
    to be made in the charge.  Instead, the jury was directed that the carbon
    monoxide finding was relevant.  To repeat a part of what the trial judge
    said in response to Crown counsel’s objection:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dr. Bullock
    says since carbon-monoxide was found, even though it cannot be quantified,
    it cannot be ruled out.  It is a toxin and, therefore, is a factor needing

    this was not Dr. Bullock’s evidence.  He never said that carbon monoxide
    cannot be ruled out.  On more than one occasion he said that he could draw
    no conclusions from the finding of carbon monoxide.  He also made no reference
    to carbon monoxide in relation to the possibility of death from the<i> commotio

    evidence was correct, when he said this:</p>

    legal causation.  Even if it were the case that the medical experts could
    not rule out carbon monoxide poisoning because of the state of decomposition
    of the body, that was not positive evidence that carbon monoxide poisoning
    was a relevant consideration in law.  The trial judge was entirely correct
    when, in response to a submission from Crown counsel, he pointed out that
    if he were to tell the jury that a cause cannot be excluded the jury might
    draw the mistaken inference that such a cause can be legally included.  To
    put the Crown’s submissions in the vernacular it was attempting to have its
    cake and eat it too.  On the one hand, it properly acknowledged that it could
    not assert that carbon monoxide was a cause of death, yet it sought to have
    the jury use the evidence of carbon monoxide to eliminate <i>commotio cordis</i> as
    a cause of death.  However, the carbon monoxide finding could play that role
    only if it was an alternative explanation for the cause of death, a position
    Crown counsel explicitly disavowed.  In my view, the result was a confusing
    and erroneous instruction that undermined the effect of the trial judge’s
    earlier correct instructions.</p>

    trial judge founded his ruling on two bases.  First, he considered the Stewart
    plot evidence similar to the suggestion made by the appellant to Fontaine
    that he was going to kill the money man.  Thus, the Stewart plot evidence
    could be used by the jury as confirming Fontaine’s evidence.  The trial judge
    said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In particular,
    those aspects of the plot which can be identified as Fiorino’s contributions
    may be highly probative of the truth of Fontaine’s assertions that Fiorino
    told him he was going to “kill the money man”.  Andreopolous was the “money
    man”.  He was killed.  David Fiorino got the money.  The “money man” was
    buried on property backfilled by Fiorino.  The conception, development and
    carrying out of the plot against Andreopolous, the Crown argues, is reflected
    in Fiorino’s conversations with Fontaine and re-reflected in Fiorino’s conversations
    with Kenneth Watson and William Campbell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Stewart plot evidence was demonstrative of the plot against the deceased.  The
    trial judge considered the Stewart plot a “carbon copy” of the plot to murder
    the deceased.  As he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Because of the
    specificity of the evidence relating as it does in detail to a murder plot,
    which out of Mr. Fiorino’s mouth appears to parallel the Crown’s theory of
    the Andreopolous murder, the jury will likely be given a clearer understanding
    of what, in fact, was going on in the weeks, days, hours, minutes and moments
    leading up to Andreopolous’ death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his ruling, the trial judge also adverted to the fact that the Stewart plot
    evidence demonstrated the appellant’s “financial motivation”.  The trial
    judge noted that the appellant refined the police officers’ original idea
    of how to make money out of the fictitious murder.  And: “More importantly,
    he needed money at that time just as he needed it at the time of Andreopolous’ disappearance.”  The
    trial judge did not otherwise elaborate on the similarities between the death
    of the deceased and the Stewart plot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ruling was made, of course, during the Crown’s case.  Defence counsel asked
    the trial judge to revisit his ruling about the uses of the evidence at the
    close of the case before the charge to the jury.  The trial judge refused
    to reconsider his ruling.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the charge to the jury, the trial judge provided the jury with a list of
    similarities between the death and the Stewart plot:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The limited
    purpose for which the evidence of the accused’s alleged participation in
    the Stewart plot is admitted is circumstantial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown alludes
    to certain features in the Stewart plot that are similar to features that
    it alleges characterized events surrounding Mr. Andreopoulos’ death. These
    include:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A scheme
    whereby a contraband dealer has made an offer he can’t refuse and then killed;</p>

    a paper trail by having transportation rented in someone else’s name.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The last is
    questionable in any event because it was David Fiorino who made the arrangements
    with Tannous to rent the van.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, the Crown
    seeks to argue from this evidence circumstantially that the time and circumstances
    of the plot mirrors the accused’s financial situation at the time of the
    July 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1996 event; that it mirrors the alleged <i>modus operandi</i>;
    that it puts into context and makes more reliable the validity of the alleged
    admissions made by the accused as to his involvement in Steven Andreopoulos’ death,
    and renders it more likely that, just as the Stewart plot was a planned murder,
    that the characteristics of that plot mirroring the allegations in the death
    of Mr. Andreopoulos, that Mr. Andreopoulos was more likely the victim of
    foul play than accident.</p>

    this passage, the trial judge explained the defence position with respect
    to the Stewart plot.  In particular, he instructed the jury repeatedly that
    the Stewart plot evidence was only relevant if the appellant genuinely believed
    he was contributing to a real plot.  He also instructed the jury that what
    the undercover officers said about the fictitious plot was not evidence against
    the appellant unless the appellant adopted what they said.  Finally, the
    trial judge gave an extensive warning against using the evidence simply as
    evidence of bad character.  </p>

    indicated, the appellant concedes that much of the Stewart plot evidence
    was properly admitted as necessary to understand the appellant’s admissions
    about the Andreopolous killing.  The appellant’s complaint is that the trial
    judge admitted all the evidence about the plot, even parts that were unnecessary
    to provide context to the admissions.  The admissibility of the Stewart plot
    evidence for the other purposes identified by the trial judge depends upon
    applying similar fact analysis as set out in <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002), 164
    C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge did not have the benefit of the <i>Handy</i> decision
    when he made his rulings.  He did, however, apply a similar analysis, relying
    upon this court’s decision in <i>R. v. B.(L.); R. v. G.(M.A.)</i> (1997),
    116 C.C.C. (3d) 481.</p>

    Binnie J. identified as a key concept the requirement that the trial judge
    identify the issue for which the similar fact evidence is tendered.  As he
    said at para. 73, the probative value of the evidence cannot be assessed
    in the abstract, since <span lang=EN>the “utility of the evidence lies precisely
    in its ability to advance or refute a live issue pending before the trier
    of fact”.  Further, as Binnie J. pointed out at para. 78, the degree of similarity
    required to justify admission will be different depending on the issue for
    which the evidence is tendered.  </span></p>

      would make one further point.  It seems to me that where the evidence is
      tendered for multiple purposes, the trial judge must decide which issues
      predominate in order to correctly weigh the probative value of the evidence
      against its prejudicial effect.  To take an example, if the predominant
      issue for which the evidence is tendered is to prove identity, the measure
      of similarity and hence admission will probably depend upon a significant
      degree of distinctiveness, as explained in para. 79 of <i>Handy</i>.  This
      would be the case even if the evidence might also be tendered for some
      other purpose, such as <i>animus</i>, for which much less compelling distinctiveness
      may suffice, as explained in para. 80 of <i>Handy</i>.  I should point
      out that this may prove difficult in some cases where the accused’s defence
      is unclear when the ruling is made and thus the trial judge may not have
      a clear picture of what the real issues are.</span></p>

      this case, the Crown tendered the Stewart plot evidence for a myriad of
      purposes.  However, in my view, at least by the close of the defence case
      the predominant similar fact issues were whether the killing was intentional
      or accidental and whether it was planned and deliberate.  The admissibility
      of the Stewart plot evidence as similar fact evidence, and not merely to
      provide context for the appellant’s admissions, had to be measured on whether
      there was sufficient similarity for those purposes so that the probative
      value outweighed the prejudicial effect.  While the degree of distinctiveness
      did not have to reach the point of striking similarity, since identify
      was not in issue, the probative value had to be substantial to outweigh
      the prejudice. </span></p>

      Binnie J. at para. 82 provided a list of factors that a court may use to
      measure the degree of connectedness between the charged act and the evidence
      tendered as similar fact evidence, and hence the probative value of that
      evidence.  Those factors are:  (1) proximity in time of the similar acts;
      (2) extent to which the other acts are similar in detail to the charged
      conduct; (3) number of occurrences of the similar acts; (4) circumstances
      surrounding or relating to the similar acts; (5) any distinctive feature(s)

      to be exhaustive and not all factors will exist or be necessary in every
      case.  On the other hand, the utility of analyzing the degree of connectedness
      against this list of factors ensures that the court takes a qualitative
      rather than quantitative approach.  If both the charged act and the similar
      fact are taken to a sufficient degree of generalization or abstraction
      a large number of similarities may be counted but the similar fact evidence

      this case, the Stewart plot and the charged offence were relatively proximate
      in time.  In addition, the plot and the charged offence shared the distinctive
      feature that the appellant intended to use a ruse of a contraband deal
      as a pretext for stealing from the victim and killing him.  The other factors
      identified by the trial judge in his ruling and in the charge to the jury
      tend to lack the distinctiveness that would provide a compelling inference
      that the accused’s conduct was intentional and premeditated.  For example,
      the trial judge identified as similarities ensuring the victim is unarmed
      and ensuring he is alone with the killer or killers, and avoiding a paper
      trail.  The first one is simply too generic to be of any assistance.  The
      second is an example of taking the facts to a level of abstraction that
      is unhelpful.  The appellant acted alone when involved with the deceased;
      the Stewart plot involved two killers and was part of a scheme involving
      a third.  The last factor of avoiding a paper trial is, as the trial judge
      recognized, not a similarity at all since the appellant had been the one
      to arrange the rental of the vehicle in the Andreopoulos killing.  </span></p>

    the plan was to eliminate any parts of the body that could be used to identify
    the victim by, for example, knocking out the teeth and removing the hands;
    the contraband involved in the Stewart plot was cocaine; the Stewart plot
    was a contract killing involving two perpetrators.  In contrast, the deceased

      to “calling cards” or “signatures” or “hallmarks”
    or “fingerprints” similarly describe propensity at the admissible end of
    the spectrum precisely because <i>the pattern of circumstances in which an
    accused is disposed to act in a certain way are so clearly linked to the
    offence charged that the possibility of mere coincidence, </i>or mistaken
    identity<i> or a mistake in the character of the act, is so slight as to
    justify consideration of the similar fact evidence by the trier of fact</i>.
    The issue at that stage is no longer “pure” propensity or “general disposition” but
    repeated conduct in a particular and highly specific type of situation. At
    that point, the evidence of similar facts provides a <i>compelling inference </i>that
    may fill a remaining gap in the jigsaw puzzle of proof, depending on the
    view ultimately taken (in this case) by the jury.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    my view, when the circumstances of the Stewart plot are closely examined
    they do not provide the compelling inference that the killing of the deceased
    was intentional and planned and deliberate.  In that respect, of particular
    importance is the difference in context.  This was a critical feature in <i>Handy</i> itself,
    as noted at para. 129, and is also important in this case.  </p>

    a general level, both events involved a fake deal for contraband.  However,
    the context of the Stewart plot is different in fundamental ways that affect
    its value as probative of the issues of intention and planning and deliberation.  The
    most striking difference in context is that the Stewart plot was to be a
    contract killing in which the appellant decided to enhance the financial
    benefit by attaching a fake cocaine deal.  On the Crown theory of the Andreopoulos
    killing, <span lang=EN>the contraband deal was the centrepiece with the killing
    of the deceased as simply a means of facilitating the theft and avoiding
    detection.  Having regard to the dissimilarities and the different context,
    the Stewart plot would not be particularly probative of whether the Andreopoulos
    killing was intentional and planned and deliberate.  Rather than demonstrating
    a particular <i>modus operandi</i> and a specific propensity, the Stewart
    plot evidence tended to show a general propensity or tendency to criminal
    conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this respect, the factor that the Crown most relies upon, that the appellant
    added the idea of not simply killing Stewart for the contract price but stealing
    from Stewart, appears to have originated with the police.  On August 26,
    1997, the appellant was first introduced to Officer Campbell, Watson’s “boss”,
    and the proposition about the contract killing was put to him.  After the
    meeting with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Campbell, the appellant showed some reluctance about doing the killing himself
    and suggested that he and Watson, in effect, subcontract the killing out
    to someone else.  Watson then suggested that he and the appellant should
    do the killing; that way they could keep all the contract money and also
    steal from Stewart.  For example, Watson said this to the appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he reason
    why I had you in mind man is cause you said to me find a fuckin chump and
    this and that remember you were telling me that find some fuckin loser whatever
    that has [any] fuckin money that can give you cash and shit like that and
    this is the exact fuckin way this guy is man <i>he’s got the cash layin around
    it’s a fuckin joke he’s got cash layin around it’s just a matter of fucking
    doing the job and taking the cash it’s all fucking there and I know it is

line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    this conversation, the appellant came up with the idea of pretending to sell
    cocaine to Stewart so that the money would be easy to get and they would
    not have to search around the house.  Again, however, the point is that the
    context of the Stewart plot and the <span lang=EN>Andreopoulos plot were
    different.</span></p>

      against the limited probative value of the evidence was the significant
      prejudicial effect.  Once the decision was made that the Stewart plot evidence
      was admissible as similar fact evidence, all of the details of the plot
      were laid before the jury including many of the gruesome details such as
      cutting off the victim’s hands and using acid to dissolve the body.  As
      a result, the Stewart plot occupied eight days of evidence at the end of
      the Crown’s case as the entire history of the plot and the details were
      reviewed in, as counsel for the appellant put it, “excruciating detail”.  Of
      course, some of the Stewart plot had to be placed before the jury so that
      they could understand the appellant’s admissions and explain why he made
      them.  However, the amount of evidence necessary for that purpose would
      have been much more limited.  </span></p>

    trial judge originally directed the jury that the after-the-fact conduct
    was as consistent with manslaughter, second degree murder and first degree
    murder and therefore it had no probative value on the degree of culpability.  However,
    later in the charge to the jury in reviewing the evidence the jury could
    use on the issue of planning and deliberation the trial judge included what
    he referred to as the “catalogue of intimidation evidence”.  For example,
    the trial judge directed the jury that they could use the evidence of the
    appellant’s attempts to intimidate Sacco and the deceased’s wife to prevent
    them from going to the police as evidence of planning and deliberation.  Thus,
    the trial judge directed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The implication
    in that evidence with respect to planning and deliberation is, from the Crown’s
    perspective, it contains within it evidence that Mr. Fiorino was intimidating
    not just Mr. Sacco but Mr. Andreopoulos’ wife after the event, and that that
    was part of a pre-determined means of diverting attention from himself as
    the person who had actually ripped off Mr. Andreopoulos.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It was his blaming
    of the bikers that was part of the plan that he conceived ahead of the death

    my view, the trial judge did not err in leaving this evidence to the jury
    on the issue of planning and deliberation.  It was open to the jury to find
    that in the days prior to the death, the appellant laid the groundwork for
    the killing by falsely telling his partners that bikers were involved and
    that he had connections with organized crime.  The jury could find that the
    appellant concocted this story as part of a scheme to blame bikers for the
    death of the deceased.  In other words, his intention all along was to not
    simply steal the money but kill the deceased and blame bikers or organized
    crime for the murder.  The fact that the appellant then carried on with this
    deception after the death bolstered the case that the killing was planned
    and deliberate.</p>

    respondent argues that even if the trial judge erred as alleged by the appellant,
    the case against the appellant was so overwhelming that the proviso in s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> should be applied.  The Crown
    submits that there is no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce
    a different verdict and relies upon <i>R. v. Jolivet</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
    751. In <i>Jolivet</i>, Binnie J. speaking for the court explained the application
    of the proviso in these terms at para. 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) requires the court to consider the seriousness
      of the error in question, the effect it likely had upon the jury’s inference-drawing

      admissible evidence untainted by the error [citations omitted].</span></p>

    my view, this is not a case for application of the proviso. While the Crown
    mounted a formidable case against the appellant, the cause of death and the
    Stewart plot evidence occupied central positions in the case.  The direction
    on cause of death significantly undermined the defence position and the similar
    fact ruling resulted in highly prejudicial evidence being placed before the
    jury.  The appellant testified and the jury obviously had difficulty with
    the case given they deliberated for over three days.  I am not convinced
    that the verdict would necessarily have been the same had the Stewart plot
    evidence been limited and the jury correctly instructed on cause of death.</p>
