    issue on this appeal is whether the respondent has a duty to defend the appellant
    against a claim made against him in his capacity as a director of a condominium
    corporation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent provided directors’ and officers’
    liability insurance to the condominium corporation and to its directors and
    officers for claims made during the policy period for “wrongful acts” that
    occurred during the policy period. The policy period of the respondent’s
    insurance policy was April 30, 2005 to April 30, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    policy also contains an extension of coverage provision that covers: “any
    wrongful act which occurs prior to the Policy Period if claim or claims are
    made during the Policy Period and provided: (a) that the Directors and Officers
    of the Corporation, at the Effective Date of the Policy, had no knowledge
    of, and could not reasonably foresee, any circumstances which might result
    in a claim, and ….”</p>

    events that led to the claims in this case occurred during the 1990’s. The
    appellant was a developer of the condominium project along with Weldon. Each
    of them purchased a unit before the declaration date of the condominium.
    However, prior to the declaration, Weldon illegally enlarged his unit into
    the attic space as a third floor living space, although this space was designated
    as part of the common area. Boland, who was a director of the corporation
    both in 1994 and again in 1997-1998, is alleged to have known about the illegal
    unit, failed to disclose it to the corporation, and stood by in January 1998,
    when Weldon sold the illegal unit to Orr.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    corporation applied against Orr to direct her to comply with the declaration
    and return the unit to its original condition. Orr sued the corporation,
    Boland and others in 2001 for damages of $4.5 million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    corporation issued a statement of claim dated June 1, 2005 against Boland
    for a declaration that: (1) he intentionally or negligently breached his
    legal duties to the corporation while he was a director regarding the existence
    of the illegal unit, and (2) he is liable to indemnify the corporation in
    respect of the Orr claim. The statement of claim states that the Orr action
    is still ongoing and outlines allegations of fact based in large part on
    evidence Boland gave on his examination for discovery in the Orr action.</p>

    then brought an application for an order that the respondent insurer either
    underwrite his defence to the corporation’s action against him or defend
    him in the action, based on the 2005 director and officers’ liability policy.
    The application judge dismissed the application and found that the insurer
    had no duty to defend on two bases: (1) the extension of the insuring agreement
    was not triggered and therefore the claim was not covered; and (2) the statement
    of claim alleged primarily deliberate conduct and that the allegation of
    negligent conduct was merely derivative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    case. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Extension of Coverage Clause</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    initial insuring agreement requires that the claim be made during the policy
    period for a wrongful act that occurred during the policy period. In this
    case, the claim was made during the policy period, but the alleged wrongful
    act occurred during the 1990’s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    extension insuring agreement also requires that the claim be made during
    the policy period but covers prior wrongful acts if, <i>at the effective
    date of the policy</i>, the directors and officers “had no knowledge of and
    could not reasonably foresee, any circumstances which might result in a claim.” The
    purpose of this condition is to allow directors and officers to be covered
    by insurance for claims that are made during the policy period for acts that
    occurred before the policy period, but at the same time, to preclude the
    corporation from obtaining insurance coverage for potential claims against
    a director that the director was aware may be made during the policy period.
    In other words, one obtains future coverage only for unexpected claims, not
    for known potential claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the policy in issue on the application provides coverage for the 2005 policy
    year and the claim was made during that year, the appellant points to the
    record which shows that the 2005 policy was the next in a succession of policies
    with the same extension of coverage agreement, beginning with the first Allianz
    policy in September, 1994. The issue for determining if the extension of
    coverage applies is, what is the “effective date of the policy” for the purpose
    of considering the knowledge of the insured director?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Reid
      Crowther
    &amp; Partners v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General Insurance Co.</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R.
    252, the Supreme Court took the view that where an insurer provides continuous
    coverage by one year policies, this amounts to a “system of successive insurance
    coverage designed to provide liability coverage from year to year.” Applying
    this approach, the effective date of the policy for the purpose of looking
    at the knowledge of the insured director that could preclude the extension
    of coverage is the effective date of the first policy in succession, in this
    case, September, 1994.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that Boland had knowledge of the illegal use
    of the attic space and that he could reasonably foresee that the illegal
    space might result in a claim. However, part of the allegations in the statement
    of claim that the application judge relied on in reaching her conclusion
    were allegations of his knowledge and actions up to January, 1998. If the
    consideration of his knowledge is limited to what he knew in 1994, the effective
    date of the policy, it cannot be said that at that time he could reasonably
    foresee a claim. Although the statement of claim is not explicit on the date,
    it is a reasonable inference from the pleading that in 1994, during his first
    term as director, the appellant asked Weldon to correct the problem. He did
    not know then that Weldon would not do that before selling the unit in 1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view therefore, for the purpose of the duty to defend only, the allegations
    in the statement of claim, if taken to be true, are not sufficient to deny
    coverage under the extension of coverage clause.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Application of the <i>Scalera</i> Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that although the claim is framed both in negligence
    and for deliberate conduct, applying the Supreme Court of Canada decision
    in <i>Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyds of London v. Scalera</i> [2000] 1 S.C.R.
    551, the negligence claim was merely derivative of the claim for deliberate
    conduct. Since the policy excludes coverage for deliberate conduct, the application
    judge found that there was no duty to defend based on the claims made against
    the appellant in the statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the application judge erred in her characterization of the negligence
    claims made in the statement of claim as derivative. The application judge
    concluded that there were no facts pleaded in support of the negligence aspect
    of the claim and that effectively, that claim arose out of the same facts
    as the claim for deliberate conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the application judge that the negligence claim is a bare pleading.
    It possibly would not survive a pleadings motion without an order for particulars.
    However, when the issue is whether an insurer has a duty to defend, one must
    take the pleading as it stands and determine whether there is a viable claim
    for negligence. In this case, although the force of the claim is for deliberate
    conduct, there is an alternative and independent claim that the appellant
    acted negligently. As this claim is available as a basis for Boland’s liability
    to the condominium corporation, the insurer has a duty to defend that claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also asks for the right to appoint counsel of his choice. This
    issue was never reached by the application judge because she dismissed the
    application. Although it is discussed in the factums, the issue was not addressed
    by counsel in oral argument. If the appellant wishes to pursue this request,
    and the parties cannot agree, it must be brought back on in the Superior
    Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would allow the appeal with costs of the appeal to the appellant,
    fixed at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., and costs below to
    the appellant in the amount fixed by the application judge.</p>
