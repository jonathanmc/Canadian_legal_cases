  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, 1657575 Ontario Inc. operating as Pleasures Gentlemen’s Club,
    a strip club, appeals the dismissal of an application for judicial review,
    in which it sought: (a) an order quashing the City of Hamilton Licensing
    Committee’s recommendation and Hamilton City Council’s decision to revoke
    the appellant’s licence to operate an adult entertainment parlour; and (b)
    an order reinstating the appellant’s licence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue in this appeal is whether the city breached the appellant’s right
    to a fair hearing.  For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the city
    did not comply with the procedural safeguards set out in its own by-law in
    recommending the revocation of the appellant’s licence and, in failing to
    do so, breached its duty to treat the appellant fairly and provide proper
    disclosure.  As a result, I would set aside the judgment of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, quash the committee’s recommendation and the council’s
    resolution to revoke the appellant’s licence, and reinstate the appellant’s
    licence. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adult
    entertainment parlours in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton are regulated by the city’s general licensing by-law, By-law 01-156
    (the by-law).  Within this by-law, the city expresses its intention to reduce
    the number of adult entertainment parlours in the city from four to two.  The
    reduction is to be achieved by the expiration or revocation of existing licences.  One
    way to revoke licences is as follows.  The “Issuer of Licences” can recommend
    a hearing before the city council’s licensing committee to determine whether
    a licence should be suspended or revoked on the basis that the licensee had
    not actively carried on business “within a reasonable period of time” following
    issuance or renewal of the licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    by-law sets out a number of procedural safeguards for licensees.  Where the
    issuer of licences recommends revoking a licence, s. 14(4) sets out the required
    contents of the recommendation, and provides that this recommendation must
    be sent to the licensee:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The recommendation
    of the Issuer of Licences shall be in writing and contain the grounds upon
    which the licence is recommended to be suspended or revoked, and shall be
    sent to the licensee and the Secretary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    licensee is also entitled to a hearing to consider whether its licence should
    be revoked or suspended.  The written notice of the hearing, which is also
    to be sent to the licensee and the issuer of the licences (s. 14(6)), must “include
    or attach the grounds [for suspension or revocation] as provided by the Issuer
    of Licences or Council” (s. 14(7)). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, s. 16(3) of the by-law requires the licensing committee, in making
    a decision, to consider the following specific factors: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(a) this By-law and other applicable law;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(b) circumstances and facts raised by the evidence of the parties;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(c) the legitimate business interests of the applicant or licensee;
    and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(d) whether the business is or will be carried on in compliance
    with the law, and whether the conduct of the person, or in the case of a
    corporation, the conduct of its officers, directors, employees or agents
    affords reasonable grounds for belief that the person will not carry on or
    engage in the business in accordance with the law or with honesty or integrity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was granted an adult entertainment licence on March 21, 2006, for
    the premises at
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street
 w:st="on">
    1038 Barton Street East,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton (the Barton premises).  The appellant paid the city $4,180 for the
    licence.  Rita Owen, the sole officer and director of the appellant, intended
    to open as soon as she obtained a liquor licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Owen was also the sole officer and director of another adult entertainment
    business: 1562423 Ontario Inc. operating as Stilletto’s.  This business had
    held an adult entertainment parlour licence since at least June 2004, but
    was not in operation at the relevant time.  Ms. Owen intended to re-open
    Stilletto’s at the same time as she opened the Barton premises.  However,
    in March 2006, the city revoked the licence for Stilletto’s because of its
    failure to actively carry on business within a reasonable period of time
    following issuance or renewal of the licence.  In response, Stilletto’s alleged
    that the licensing committee had prejudged the matter and violated procedural
    fairness.  Stilletto’s was originally a party to this application for judicial
    review but was forced to abandon the application due to financial difficulties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 11, 2006, the Director of Building and Licensing recommended a hearing
    to consider revoking the licence for the Barton premises on the basis that
    the licensee had not actively carried on business within a reasonable period
    of time following the issuance of the licence: see s. 14(1).  A copy of this
    recommendation was not sent to the licensee as required by s. 14(1).</p>

    May 24, 2006, the city sent the appellant a notice that a hearing to revoke
    its licence had been scheduled for July 6, 2006.  The notice referred to
    the recommendation of revocation by the Standards &amp; Licensing Division,
    but did not include the grounds for this recommendation as the Standards &amp; Licensing
    Division had set them out, as required by s. 14(7) of the by-law.  Instead,

    intended to rely upon at the hearing.  The Director of Building and Licensing
    responded to the disclosure request by letter on July 4, 2006, two days before
    the scheduled hearing.  The director’s letter indicated simply that the city
    would introduce the following evidence at the hearing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    is expected to address the licensing status of

    counsel responded to this letter on July 5, 2006, requesting a copy of any
    and all evidence the city intended to rely upon at the hearing as well as
    any “will say” statements with regard to the anticipated evidence of the
    Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario and the city’s licensing inspectors.  The

    Owen and her counsel attended at the hearing before the licensing committee
    on July 6, 2006.  At the outset of the hearing, counsel for the appellant
    raised an issue with respect to the failure to provide disclosure but no
    adjournment was granted and the hearing proceeded on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the hearing, it became apparent that information provided by the city in
    its May 11 and July 4 letters was, to a large extent, false or misleading:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>a)    None of the documents referred to in the city’s letters
    were ever provided to the appellant;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>b)    items (i) and (ii) in the May 24 letter did not exist;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>c)    the evidence given by the city’s witness was that the
    liquor license application had not been cancelled;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>d)    no sale of land for tax arrears was ever raised at the
    hearing; and</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>e)    AGCO Inspector Thompson did not attend or give evidence
    at the hearing.  (The Licensing Committee did, however, hear testimony from
    a licensing inspector and a liquor licensing constable employed by the city
    to the effect that the premises had not been operated after issuance of the
    licence.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    this point, Ms. Owen would certainly have become aware of the basis upon
    which the city was seeking to revoke the licence.  In her evidence on behalf
    of the appellant, she testified as to the efforts made to open the Barton
    premises for business.  She indicated that she had dancers ready to work
    but had encountered difficulties in acquiring a liquor licence.  She indicated
    her intention to open for business immediately, without alcohol, and to operate
    in that manner until obtaining the liquor licence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the hearing, the licensing committee voted unanimously
    to recommend to city council revocation of the appellant’s licence for failure
    to actively carry on business within a reasonable time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faced
    with the recommendation of the committee and knowing the basis for the proposed
    revocation, the appellant immediately opened the premises for business on
    July 10, 2006, notwithstanding the absence of a liquor licence.  Counsel
    for the appellant then learned that the committee’s recommendation had been
    added to council’s agenda for its July 12, 2006, meeting.  He therefore faxed
    submissions to the mayor and council members summarizing the appellant’s
    position, confirming that the premises were now open and requesting that
    council refer the matter back to the committee or decline to follow the recommendation.  He
    also faxed to city council a statutory declaration stating that the premises
    were open for business.  However, this fax was not received by council prior
    to the vote because, unbeknownst to the appellant, the council meeting time
    had been changed from evening to day time.</p>

    cases involving breaches of procedural fairness, the court will generally
    set aside the decision without considering whether the result would have

    [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643 at<b> </b>661, in which LeDain J. rejected the suggestion

    is whether the holding of a hearing would have persuaded authorities to change
    their minds on the decision made:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he denial
    of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether
    or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have
    resulted in a different decision.  The right to a fair hearing must be regarded
    as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification
    in the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative
    decision is entitled to have.  It is not for the court to deny that right
    and sense of justice on the basis of speculation as to what the result might
    have been had there been a hearing.</p>

    my view, therefore, the central issue for consideration in this case is the
    impact that the failure to make disclosure had on the appearance of justice
    and the fairness of the hearing.  I need not consider whether, had full disclosure
    been provided, the appellant would still have been unable to persuade the
    licensing committee members to reach a different decision.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the criteria outlined in <i>Baker</i>, it is apparent that the duty of procedural
    fairness in the circumstances of this case requires, at a minimum, that the
    committee have provided the licensee with the basis of the proposed revocation
    and an accurate statement of the grounds.  We need go no further than the
    by-law, which mandates that this information be provided to the licensee
    not once, but twice: first, when the original recommendation is made and
    again when the notice of hearing is sent: see ss. 14(4) and 14(7).  In my
    view, such a requirement reflects the principle that when one’s ability to
    carry on business is being put at risk, one should not have to guess why
    revocation of the licence is being proposed or speculate as to the grounds
    for the proposed revocation.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    notice provided by the city on May 24, 2006, made no reference to s. 14(1)(e)
    as the basis for the proposal and failed to comply with the obligation to
    disclose the grounds for the recommendation to revoke the appellant’s licence
    as prescribed in s.&nbsp;14(4) of the by-law.  The grounds identified simply
    referred to a series of largely irrelevant documents and sections of the
    by-law relating to the committee’s process and procedures.  It would have
    been impossible for the appellant to extract from this notice any meaningful
    understanding of the grounds for the recommendation to revoke its licence.  In
    fact, as I have noted earlier, the notice itself was misleading in respect
    of the type of evidence that would be introduced at the hearing.  </p>

    subsequent letter from the city, dated July 4, 2006, came two days before
    the hearing and served only to further mislead the appellant about the nature
    of the evidence to be introduced at the hearing.  While the letter referred
    to the licensing inspector’s being expected to provide evidence that the
    business was closed on numerous occasions, it failed to clearly define the
    issue to be determined before the committee.  </p>

    respondent also argued that the failure to comply with the by-law did not
    affect the fairness of the hearing because, by the date of the committee
    hearing, the appellant was clearly aware of the grounds and basis for the
    proposed revocation.  The appellant, therefore, suffered no prejudice in
    that Ms. Owen addressed the grounds for the proposed revocation.  She gave
    evidence of the extensive efforts she had undertaken to open the Barton premises
    for business.  Specifically, she testified to the difficulties encountered
    in acquiring a liquor licence and the unresponsiveness of the retail sales
    tax branch noting that, but for the outstanding retail sales tax issue, the
    business would be open.  The respondent submits, therefore, that the appellant
    was able to meet the case against it and therefore suffered no prejudice
    because of the delay in disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject this submission for two reasons.  First, as I have said, the
    failure to advise the appellant of the basis or the grounds for the revocation
    contravened the provisions of the city’s own by-law and, on the facts of
    this case, was procedurally unfair. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the respondent’s submission that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a
    result of the delay is pure speculation.  Indeed, an argument could be made
    that earlier disclosure would have affected the appellant’s conduct.  Immediately
    after the committee hearing and before the council meeting, the appellant
    decided to open for business notwithstanding the absence of a liquor licence.  If
    proper disclosure had been made, the appellant would have known well before
    the hearing date that the failure to open was the basis of the recommendation.  As
    a consequence, it may for example have commenced operation of the business
    well prior to the committee hearing.  How the decision maker would have responded
    to any of this changed conduct is irrelevant.  It is not for this court to
    speculate as to whether the result would have been the same had there been
    timely and adequate disclosure: see <i>Cardinal v. Director of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
