style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant is charged with first degree
    murder in the state of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  He was arrested in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in October 2006, and in
    December 2006, the United Stated requested his extradition on the charge of
    first degree murder.  In January 2007, the
    respondent (the Minister of Justice) authorized the Attorney General of Canada
    to proceed with the extradition request on the charge of murder contrary to s.
    231 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46.  In June 2007, the extradition
    judge, O’Neill J., ordered the applicant committed on the charge of second
    degree murder.  He provided reasons for
    that decision in October 2007:  see <i>U.S.A. v. Fischbacher</i>, [2007] O.J. No.
    4235 (S.C.J.).  In March 2008, the
    Minister ordered the applicant surrendered on the charge of first degree murder
    under the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona
    statute, subject to receiving the necessary assurances that the death penalty
    would not be imposed or carried out.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant seeks judicial review.  He submits that the Minister’s decision to
    surrender him on the charge of first degree murder as defined in the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Arizona statute is unreasonable because at the
    extradition hearing the requesting state failed to lead any evidence of
    premeditation, an essential element of the offence under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Arizona law.  Based on this “misalignment”, he submits the surrender order must be
    quashed.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the applicant’s contention.  I would quash the order of the Minister and
    remit the matter to the Minister for further consideration in light of these
    reasons.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant is charged in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Tucson,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona
    with one count of first degree murder.  The
    extradition judge summarized the allegations in para. 1 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is alleged by
    the Pima County Attorney’s Office in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tucson,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Arizona that on October 5<sup>th</sup>, 2006, Henry
    Fischbacher and Lisa Fischbacher, husband and wife, were engaged in an argument
    at their home at 9870 North Eastern Fork Trail in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Tucson,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona.  In the amended record of the case for the
    prosecution, the prosecution alleges that Mr. Fischbacher struck his wife in
    the head several times with a flashlight.  After she fell unconscious, he dragged her to the swimming pool in the
    backyard and held her underwater for several minutes.  Lisa Fischbacher was later found in the
    swimming pool by law enforcement authorities and pronounced dead.  A forensic pathologist performed an autopsy
    on her and determined that the cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries,
    including blunt injuries to the head and findings consistent with asphyxia.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In October 2006, a grand jury in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Tucson,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona issued an
    indictment charging the applicant with one count of first degree murder in
    violation of the relevant
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona
    statute.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    requested extradition
    on that charge in December 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 8, 2007, the Minister signed the
    Authority to Proceed (ATP) required under s. 15 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “<i>Act</i>”).  The ATP read:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Minister of
    Justice authorizes the Attorney General of Canada to proceed before the
    Superior Court of Justice to seek an order for the committal of Henry C.
    Fischbacher who is being sought for prosecution by the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    .  <u>The Canadian offence which corresponds to
    the alleged conduct is:</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Murder,
    contrary to s. 231 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The ATP did not particularize the charge as
    first or second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The judicial phase of the extradition process
    proceeded in June 2007.  At para. 8 of
    his reasons, the extradition judge observed that s. 29(1) of the <i>Act</i> required him to commit where:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]here is
    evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada,
    would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the authority
    to proceed.…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge held that the reference to
    “murder contrary to s. 231 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>” must be taken as alleging a charge of second degree murder.  In coming to that conclusion, he relied
    heavily on s. 582 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which provides that no one can be convicted on the charge of first degree
    murder unless the indictment specifically charges that offence.  At para. 21, he held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The selection of
    the word murder by the Minister deems, as a matter of law, that the
    corresponding Canadian offence is second degree murder.  The wording of an offence in an ATP should be
    given its settled legal meaning.  For
    several decades now, as a matter of law, an indictment charging an accused with
    “murder” is deemed to be a charge of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge next considered the
    argument advanced on behalf of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.A.</st1:country-region>
    that he should authorize an
    amendment of the ATP, pursuant to s. 23(2) of the <i>Act</i>, to allege first degree murder.  After considering the legal meaning of the words planned and deliberate
    and examining the evidence in the record before him, he concluded at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    evidence that the murder was both planned and deliberate.  There is no indication that it was a
    calculated scheme or design that had been carefully thought out, or that the
    consequences of murder had been thought over and sized up.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The extradition judge committed the applicant
    for extradition on the offence of second degree murder.  There was no appeal from that order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In keeping with the scheme of the <i>Act</i>, it then fell to the Minister to
    determine whether the applicant should be surrendered and, if so, for what
    offence.  In written submissions, counsel
    for the applicant took the position that the applicant should be surrendered on
    the offence of second degree murder contrary to the relevant
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Arizona statute.  Counsel provided an opinion from an
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Arizona lawyer that the requirement of premeditation for
    first degree murder in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona was akin to the
    requirements of planning and deliberation for first degree murder in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Counsel also provided the relevant statutory
    material from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Arizona
    indicating that the punishment for first degree murder, even excluding the
    possibility of the death penalty, was significantly greater than the potential
    penalty for second degree murder.  Counsel
    made this submission to the Minister:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>[T]he evidence
    in this matter and the legal conclusions on that evidence reached at the
    committal hearing have the impact of foreclosing a surrender Order framed such
    as to permit Mr. Fischbacher to be surrendered to the United States for trial
    for the offence of 1<sup>st</sup> degree murder,</u> contrary to the <i>Criminal Code</i> of Arizona.  It is conceded, however, that a surrender
    order would be appropriate that surrendered Mr. Fischbacher to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    for trial for the offence of 2<sup>nd</sup> degree murder contrary to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Arizona.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In exercising his discretion in favour of
    surrendering the applicant on the charge of first degree murder, the Minister
    rejected the contention that he was surrendering the applicant on an offence
    that was different from the offence for which the committal judge had committed
    him for surrender.  The Minister opined:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Under Canadian
    law, first and second degree murder are not different offences.</u>  The classification of murder as either first
    or second degree is for sentencing purposes only and relates to the punishment
    that will be imposed upon conviction.  Accordingly,
    in the context of extradition, <u>once the extradition judge has concluded
    there is sufficient evidence to justify a committal for the Canadian offence of
    murder, double criminality has been established for any foreign murder charge
    irrespective of the degree.</u>  [Citations
    omitted; Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <h2>III.       IS THE SURRENDER ORDER
    UNREASONABLE?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the Minister sees this application
    as engaging the fundamental principles underlying the extradition process in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  I think the ambit is considerably narrower
    than that.  I begin my analysis with a
    description of what I see as the relatively confined metes and bounds of the
    issue raised on this application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Act</i> gives the Minister broad powers of surrender.  Section 58(b) expressly contemplates that in exercising that broad
    surrender power the Minister may surrender a fugitive on “the offence in respect
    of which extradition is requested”.  Nothing
    argued by the applicant questions the Minister’s statutory power to surrender a
    fugitive on the foreign offence for which extradition was requested.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also do not interpret the applicant’s
    submissions as engaging the double criminality principle.  The Minister’s surrender order clearly
    respects that principle.  The conduct
    alleged by the requesting state constitutes the crime of murder in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the applicant does not challenge the
    now well-established standard of review that must be applied to a Minister’s
    surrender decision.  This court must show
    deference to the Minister’s surrender decision and will interfere with the
    Minister’s decision only if in all of the circumstances his decision is properly

    unreasonable for the Minister to conclude that it would not be unjust or
    oppressive to surrender the applicant on the charge of first degree
    murder.  Counsel submits that the feature
    that makes the exercise of the Minister’s discretion unreasonable is the extradition
    judge’s unchallenged determination that there was no evidence of planning and
    deliberation and his unchallenged order that the applicant should be
    surrendered on the charge of second degree murder.  </p>

    the Minister’s exercise of his discretion is based exclusively on what the case
    law describes as a “misalignment” between the offence for which the Minister
    ordered the applicant surrendered and evidence adduced at the committal
    proceedings.  Both the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal and this court have held that this “misalignment” may render
    the surrender decision unreasonable:  see <i>U.S.A. v. Reumayr</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C.

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    sought the
    applicant’s extradition on charges that alleged an attempt to blow up the Trans-Alaska
    Pipeline.  The ATP issued by the Minister
    referred to the <i>Criminal Code</i> offences as possession of an explosive substance, possession of materials with
    intent to cause the explosion of explosive substances, attempted arson, and
    attempted mischief.  After a hearing, the
    extradition judge committed the fugitive on the two possession charges, but
    declined to commit him on the attempted arson and attempted mischief charges.  The Minister subsequently ordered the
    fugitive surrendered on the charges as framed in the request for extradition,
    including the charge alleging the attempt to bomb the Trans-Alaska
    Pipeline.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On judicial review of the surrender order, the
    Minister argued that his surrender power was not limited to the Canadian
    offences on which the extradition judge had ordered committal.  The court agreed that the surrender order was
    not subject to that limitation.  However,
    it further held that the surrender power could not be exercised without regard
    to the committal proceedings and the order made in those proceedings.  Substantive inconsistencies or misalignments
    between the committal proceedings and the surrender order would render the
    surrender order unreasonable.  The court
    said at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he statutory
    scheme does not authorize extradition for offences that <u>substantively exceed
    the offences that are supported in the committal proceedings.  It would defeat the purpose of the committal
    hearing if the Minister’s discretion extended to surrender for offences
    substantively beyond those supported by evidence at the committal hearing.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    surrenders a fugitive for a different offence than the offence for which the
    fugitive was committed, the Minister should explain why the difference is not a
    substantive one.  The court remitted the
    matter to the Minister to determine whether his surrender order on the charge
    of attempting to bomb the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was “substantively consistent”
    (para. 44) with the extradition judge’s committal order on the possession
    charges only.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    and applied <i>Reumayr</i> demonstrate that differences
    between the offence in the surrender order and the offence for which the
    fugitive was committed will render the surrender order unreasonable only in
    limited circumstances.  In <i>Gorcyca</i>, <i>supra</i>, the first of the three cases, Goudge J.A. began by rejecting
    (at para. 55) the fugitive’s argument that the principle of double criminality
    required that the conduct alleged in the surrender order coincide with the
    Canadian offence for which the fugitive had been committed.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Minister can
    order surrender in terms of the foreign offence for which extradition is sought
    if the conduct alleged by the foreign state to be sufficient for the foreign
    prosecution has been found both admissible under the <i>Act</i> and sufficient, if committed here, to justify committal for a
    Canadian offence that corresponds to that conduct.  That is exactly what happened here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Goudge J.A. then considered a more limited “misalignment”
    argument.  Referring to the above-quoted
    passage from <i>Reumayr</i>, Goudge J.A.
    said at para. 64:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view, <u>only
    where there is an absence of evidence on what would appear to be an essential
    element of the foreign charge in the surrender order could it be argued that
    the order is plainly unreasonable or unjust or oppressive, at least without an
    explanation of why it is not.</u>  In
    such circumstances it could well be plainly unreasonable to deport someone
    where, from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Goudge J.A. was careful to distinguish between
    cases where there was some evidence to support all of the essential elements of
    the foreign charge led at the committal and cases where there was no evidence
    of an essential element.  It was only in
    the latter circumstance that surrender on the foreign charge would amount to
    surrender for an offence substantially beyond that supported by the
    evidence.  </p>

    that a surrender order listing the foreign offence in the request would be
    unreasonable only if there was a total absence of any evidence at the committal
    proceeding to support what appeared to be an essential element of the foreign
    charge.  After examining the record and
    the nature of the allegations in <i>Saad</i>,
    the Associate Chief Justice found that any difference between the offence as described
    in the surrender order and the evidence adduced at the committal proceedings
    related to matters of detail and did not result in any substantive difference
    between the surrender order and the evidence led at the committal proceeding.  </p>

    cases, the ATP referred to various <i>Criminal
    Code</i> offences, including conspiracy to commit money laundering and a charge
    of obstruction of justice by tampering with witnesses.  There was no evidence led to support these two
    charges at the committal proceedings.  Counsel
    for the requesting state did not seek the committal of the fugitive on those
    charges.  The extradition judge did not
    commit on those two charges but did commit on other charges set out in the ATP.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister ordered the fugitive surrendered on
    several offences as described in the documentation from the requesting state.  These included the conspiracy and witness
    tampering charges on which the Attorney General had not sought committal and
    the extradition judge had not committed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court allowed the application for judicial
    review and set aside the surrender order on the charges of conspiracy and
    witness tampering.  Sharpe J.A., at
    paras. 39-40, explained that ordering the fugitive surrendered for charges that
    were before the extradition judge but in support of which no evidence was led
    constituted an unreasonable exercise of the Minister’s discretion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Coming back to the facts of this case, on the
    material before the Minister, the charge of first degree murder as defined in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Arizona required proof
    that the murder was premeditated.  The
    extradition judge found, and the Minister does not question this finding, that
    there was no evidence led at the committal proceeding that could support a
    finding that the alleged murder was planned and deliberate.  The Minister also had information that the
    concept of premeditation as applied under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Arizona law was similar to the notion of
    planning and deliberation under Canadian law. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying the analysis in <i>Gorcyca</i>, <i>supra</i>, the
    requesting state failed to adduce any evidence in the committal proceeding to
    support a finding of premeditation, an essential element of the charge of first
    degree murder as defined in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Arizona.  Despite this failure, the Minister chose to
    surrender on that charge.  Again,
    applying the <i>Gorcyca</i> analysis, that
    decision is presumptively unreasonable, unless there is some adequate explanation
    from the Minister.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister’s letter explaining his surrender
    decision does not acknowledge any inconsistency between the offence on which he
    ordered the applicant surrendered and the committal proceedings.  It would seem that the Minister perceived no
    misalignment because “under Canadian law, first and second degree murder are
    not different offences”.  It would also
    seem that the Minister regarded any complaint about the differences between the
    offence for which the applicant was ordered surrendered and the offence for
    which the applicant was ordered committed as engaging only double criminality
    concerns.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Accordingly, in the
    context of extradition, once the extradition judge has concluded that there is
    sufficient evidence to justify a committal for the Canadian offence of murder,
    double criminality has been established for any foreign murder charge
    irrespective of the degree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the “misalignment” cases establish, the
    reasonableness of the Minister’s surrender order does not depend exclusively on
    whether that order offends the double criminality principle.  As indicated above, I do not think the
    Minister’s surrender order runs afoul of that principle.  The question is whether the Minister acted
    unreasonably in deciding that it was not unjust to order the applicant
    surrendered on a charge of first degree murder after the requesting state
    failed to lead any evidence to support an essential element of that charge at
    the committal proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister observed that first and second
    degree murder are not distinct crimes in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  It would appear that he drew the further
    conclusion that because first and second degree murder are two categories of
    the single crime of murder, there is no substantive difference under Canadian
    law between first and second degree murder.  Because the two crimes are the same offence, there could be no
    “misalignment” between a surrender order on first degree murder and a committal
    order on second degree murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Minister correctly describes first and
    second degree murder as defined in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>:  see <i>Droste v. The Queen</i> (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 404 at 414 (S.C.C.); however,
    the mere fact that the <i>Criminal Code</i> is structured to make first and second degree murder branches of the single
    crime of murder does not mean that there are not substantive differences
    between the two levels of murder.  There
    are important and significant differences in the essential elements of first
    and second degree murder and in the potential penalties applicable upon
    conviction:  see <i>Criminal Code</i> ss. 229, 231, 235 and 745.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More to the point, under the “misalignment”
    cases, the reasonableness of the Minister’s order does not depend on the
    treatment of first and second degree murder under Canadian domestic law.  The reasonableness of that order depends on
    whether there was a total absence of evidence at the committal proceedings on
    an essential element of the foreign crime for which the Minister ordered the
    applicant surrendered.  It is
    unchallenged that premeditation is an essential element of the only potentially
    applicable definition of first degree murder in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Arizona statute.  It is also accepted that the requesting state
    led no evidence of premeditation at the committal proceeding.  The injustice lies in the surrender of the
    applicant on the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Arizona
    charge of first degree murder when no evidence to support an essential element
    of that charge was led at the committal.  It is no answer to that injustice to observe that in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    first
    and second degree murder are but two categories of the substantive crime of
    murder.  </p>

    of first degree murder as defined in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Arizona
    statute was substantively beyond the second degree murder charge supported by
    the evidence at the committal hearing, it is also helpful to examine the
    potential penalties for first and second degree murder under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Arizona law.  Apart from circumstances that have no application here, a person

    mitigated or aggravated by up to six years, depending on the circumstances of
    the particular case: see Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-710 (Lexis 2008).</p>
