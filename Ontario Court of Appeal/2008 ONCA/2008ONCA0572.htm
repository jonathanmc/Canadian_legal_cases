  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>I.          OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was originally committed for trial
    on a charge of first degree murder.  This
    court quashed that committal and substituted a committal on the charge of
    second degree murder:  see <i>R. v. MacDonald</i>, [2004] O.J. No.
    1756.  At trial, the appellant
    acknowledged that he had assaulted the victim and caused his death.  However, the appellant urged the jury to
    acquit him on the murder charge and convict him on the included offence of
    manslaughter.  The jury convicted on the
    charge of second degree murder.  The
    appellant appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel on behalf of the appellant advanced
    three grounds of appeal.  They contend
    that:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
    jury that “not guilty” was a possible verdict.</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge misdirected the jury on the
    meaning of reckless in s. 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge failed to adequately caution the
    jury against the use of propensity reasoning in respect of evidence about the
    appellant’s prison history.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>II.        THE EVIDENCE</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The victim, James Campbell, a man in his early
    sixties, and the appellant, who was in his early forties, met in a park in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The appellant had been drinking.  After talking for awhile, Mr. Campbell and
    the appellant decided to go to a local bar.  As they were headed to the bar, Mr. Campbell invited the appellant to
    come back to his apartment.  The
    appellant, who was bisexual, asked Mr. Campbell if he was homosexual.  Mr. Campbell indicated that he was.  The appellant agreed to go back to Mr.
    Campbell’s apartment.  He thought that
    sexual activity could occur.  The
    appellant, who had no place to stay that night, had engaged in consensual sexual
    activity with men in the past in exchange for a place to stay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The direct evidence of the events at the
    apartment comes exclusively from the appellant’s testimony.  He indicated that both he and Mr. Campbell
    had a lot to drink after they arrived at the apartment.  They moved to the bedroom and began to engage
    in consensual sexual activity.  The
    appellant was performing oral sex on Mr. Campbell when Mr. Campbell grabbed the
    appellant’s testicles and squeezed very hard.  The appellant pulled away; Mr. Campbell responded by flicking his
    fingers at the appellant’s face.  A
    struggle ensued during which the appellant placed his arms around Mr.
    Campbell’s neck and squeezed for about five or six seconds.  After the appellant relaxed his grip, Mr.
    Campbell did not move.  The appellant
    checked for a pulse and realized that Mr. Campbell was dead.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to the appellant, he panicked thinking
    that because of his criminal background, no one would believe that he had not
    intended to kill Mr. Campbell.  The
    appellant contemplated suicide but decided instead to try to make it look as
    though Mr. Campbell had been robbed.  He
    spent some time trying to destroy evidence and create false clues at the
    scene.  He also took fifteen dollars from
    Mr. Campbell’s apartment when he fled.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Campbell’s sister found her brother’s body
    later the same day.  Blood and urine samples
    taken at the post-mortem examination showed that Mr. Campbell’s blood-alcohol
    level was 0.158.  Mr. Campbell was a
    regular drinker and had developed a tolerance to alcohol.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The post-mortem also revealed that Mr. Campbell
    had died as a result of neck compression, possibly due to manual
    strangulation.  The injuries to the area
    around Mr. Campbell’s neck indicated that his assailant had used a significant
    amount of pressure.  It was possible that
    the assailant had been kneeling on Mr. Campbell’s back when he applied pressure
    to his neck.  The pathologist explained
    that depending on the exact physiological cause of death, the assailant may
    have been squeezing Mr. Campbell’s neck for as little as fifteen seconds or as
    long as ninety seconds.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant is an admitted alcoholic with a
    lengthy criminal past.  He had left a
    detoxification centre the morning of the homicide.  He testified that he was very drunk when the
    incidents culminating in Mr. Campbell’s death occurred.  He insisted that he did not mean to cause Mr.
    Campbell serious harm and did not foresee the likelihood of death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant admitted that he took fifteen
    dollars from Mr. Campbell’s wallet as part of his plan to make it look as if
    there had been a robbery.  Other valuables
    were left in the apartment.  The
    appellant also destroyed some potentially incriminating evidence while he was
    in the apartment after the homicide.  He
    spent about a half an hour altering the scene of the homicide before leaving
    the apartment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown argued that the appellant was guilty
    of murder either under the definition in s. 229(a)(i) or the definition in s.
    229(a)(ii).  The defence expressly and repeatedly
    acknowledged the appellant’s liability for manslaughter.  Counsel submitted, however, that the Crown had
    not proved the requisite <i>mens rea</i> for
    murder under either definition of murder.  The defence of provocation was also available on the evidence.  No issue is taken with the trial judge’s
    instruction relating to provocation.  The
    jury rejected that defence.  </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>III.       THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h2>(i)        Did
    the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury that “not guilty” was a
    possible verdict?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon arraignment at the commencement of trial,
    the appellant pleaded not guilty as charged.  The appellant did not enter a guilty plea to the included offence of
    manslaughter.  Had he done so, the Crown
    would not have accepted that plea, and the trial would have proceeded before
    the jury, just as it did on the appellant’s plea of not guilty to the charge of
    second degree murder: see <i>R. v. Pentiluk
    and MacDonald</i> (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 87 at 90-91 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d [1977]
    2 S.C.R. 832; <i>Criminal Code</i>, s.
    606(4).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant at trial, an
    experienced and able defence counsel, made it clear throughout the trial that
    the appellant acknowledged that he had unlawfully caused Mr. Campbell’s death
    and was guilty of manslaughter.  For
    example, during submissions on the admissibility of the appellant’s criminal
    record, counsel defined the issue at trial as “whether it’s murder or
    manslaughter”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the pre-charge discussion which preceded
    counsel’s closing arguments, counsel for the appellant reiterated his position
    and approved a verdict sheet that contained only two possible verdicts – guilty
    of manslaughter or guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his closing submissions, counsel made at
    least four references to the appellant’s acknowledged guilt on the manslaughter
    charge.  At one point, counsel said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this case, the
    presumption of innocence means that Peter MacDonald is presumed to be innocent
    of the offence of second degree murder.  <u>I
    didn’t say anything about manslaughter.  Because, as I told you in my opening, that’s conceded.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Near the end of his closing, counsel made the
    defence position very clear:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Maybe in the
    state that he would have been in as a bouncer at a bar, he would have taken
    more control of the situation and not done the harm <u>that, by his own
    admission, condemns him at least to a conviction for manslaughter.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant had testified.  Nothing in his evidence could be taken as
    detracting from or modifying the position so clearly taken on his behalf by
    counsel throughout the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her instructions, the trial judge began by
    telling the jury:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now members of
    the jury, this case is not a whodunit.  We know whodunit.  By his own
    admission, Mr. MacDonald unlawfully killed Mr. Campbell.  The issue in this case is whether what he did
    was second degree murder or manslaughter.  <u>Accordingly, there are only two possible verdicts available to you,
    guilty of second degree murder or guilty of manslaughter.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the course of reviewing the position of the
    defence, the trial judge reiterated the defence contention that the appellant
    was guilty of manslaughter but not murder.  The trial judge also provided the jury with a decision tree and a
    verdict sheet, both of which contemplated only two verdicts: guilty as charged
    or guilty of manslaughter.  There was no
    objection to the instructions or to the written material given to the
    jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The position advanced by experienced counsel at
    trial is not unknown in murder cases.  The
    evidence that the appellant had killed Mr. Campbell was very strong.  There was a potential tactical advantage in a
    forthright admission of culpability in the victim’s death.  The appellant’s straightforward admission and
    willingness to accept responsibility for his acts before the jury could
    potentially have assisted him when the jury came to decide whether he had the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i> for murder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant in this court (who
    were not the appellant’s trial counsel) frankly acknowledge that the decision
    to admit liability for manslaughter before the jury was a sound tactical
    decision undertaken with the benefit of advice from experienced counsel.  Counsel goes on to argue, however, that when
    the trial judge, consistent with the defence position, instructed the jury that
    an acquittal was not an available verdict, she denied the appellant his
    constitutional right to a trial by jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I say immediately that it seems most curious
    that a trial judge can be said to have denied an accused his right to a trial
    by jury by putting that accused’s case to the jury in exactly the way the
    accused wanted it put.  As curious as this
    proposition might seem, counsel for the appellant submits that the unanimous
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. Krieger</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 303 dictates that the trial judge
    violated the appellant’s right to a trial by jury when, consistent with his
    defence, she did not leave an acquittal as a possible verdict.  Counsel notes that <i>Krieger</i> was released some two years after the trial judge
    instructed the jury in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not read <i>Krieger</i> as broadly as does counsel for the appellant.  In <i>Krieger</i>,
    the accused elected trial by judge and jury on a charge of producing
    marijuana.  He made certain factual
    admissions at trial.  He advanced a
    defence of necessity based on his medical condition.  At the end of the evidence, the trial judge
    held, correctly, that there was no air of reality to the necessity defence and
    he declined to put that defence to the jury.  Without the necessity defence the rest of the evidence and the accused’s
    admissions made the Crown’s case overwhelming.</p>

    defence was not available, there was a discussion among counsel and the trial
    judge as to the accused’s options.  There
    was some suggestion of a guilty plea; however, the accused chose to let the
    matter go to the jury despite the apparent overwhelming nature of the evidence
    and the absence of any viable defence.  The trial judge directed the jury that it must return a guilty
    verdict.  After several hours and with
    obvious difficulty on the part of at least some of the jurors, the jury
    followed that instruction and convicted.  </p>

    availability of any defence to the charge on the evidence, the accused who is
    being tried by a judge and jury is entitled to the verdict of the jury.  As interpreted in <i>Krieger</i>, the constitutional right to a trial by jury includes the
    right to the chance of a perverse acquittal by a jury.  </p>

    relies heavily on this passage at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown submits
    that Mr. Krieger’s testimony and defence counsel’s submissions in the course of
    the trial are tantamount to a guilty plea.  It is true, of course, that the fate of the accused will often be sealed
    by their own testimony and admissions, or by concessions and submissions of
    their counsel.  <u>But absent a plea of
    guilty, the need for a verdict remains.</u>  And in a trial by judge and jury, the verdict must be that of the jury,
    not the judge – unless the judge finds the evidence insufficient and directs a <i>verdict of acquittal</i> on that ground.  [Underlined added; italics in original.]</p>

    and expressly acknowledged the appellant’s liability for manslaughter.  Counsel also accepts that the appellant’s
    testimony was entirely consistent with the position taken on his behalf by
    trial counsel.  Relying on the
    above-quoted passage, however, counsel submits that only a plea of guilty to
    the included offence of manslaughter could justify the trial judge’s decision
    to remove the possibility of an acquittal from the jury.  I note that absent the consent of the Crown,
    the court could not have accepted such a plea:  see <i>Pentiluk and MacDonald</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 90-91.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel cites two cases in this court subsequent
    to <i>Krieger</i> that he submits have affirmed
    the principle that only formal admissions of liability can justify the removal
    of the possibility of an acquittal in a jury case: see <i>R. v. Allen</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4458; <i>R. v. Maharaj</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 87.  Both cases refer to the need for a “formal admission” of guilt before a
    trial judge can take the possibility of an acquittal away from a jury.  However, in these cases, as in <i>Krieger</i>, the accused individuals made no
    admissions of culpability with respect to any part of the charges against them.  Instead, in each case, the trial judges
    decided, based on their assessment of the evidence, that the Crown’s case, on
    at least part of the charge, was so overwhelming as to preclude the possibility
    of an acquittal.  In all three cases, the
    trial judges removed the possibility of an acquittal in an effort to help the
    jury focus on what the trial judges saw as the contentious issues.  After <i>Krieger</i>,
    an accused’s right to a trial by jury forecloses judicial exclusion of the
    possibility of an acquittal based on the trial judge’s assessment of the case
    at the end of the evidence.  This is the
    principle flowing from the constitutional right to a jury trial that I take
    from <i>Krieger</i>.  </p>

    part of the indictment or an essential element of the offence only by a guilty
    plea.  The reference (para. 27, <i>supra</i>) in the passage from <i>Krieger</i> to a “guilty plea” is made in
    the context of a case in which the trial judge instructed the jury to return a
    guilty verdict on the full charge on which the accused had elected trial by
    jury.  It is difficult to think of an
    admission other than a guilty plea that would justify an instruction to the
    jury to convict on the full charge. </p>

    accused proposes to admit liability for an included offence or to concede an
    essential element of the offence.  In
    those circumstances, a guilty plea may not be possible – much less provide the
    only means by which an accused could make an effective admission. In <i>R. v. Gunning</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d)
    123 (S.C.C.), a case in which all of the judges who sat on <i>Krieger</i> sat, the unanimous court, through Charron J., at para. 30, stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is important
    to note that the “air of reality” test has no application in respect of the
    question of whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each
    essential element of the offence.  By his
    plea of not guilty, the accused in effect advances the “defence” that the Crown
    has not met its burden in respect of one or more of the necessary ingredients
    of the offence.  <u>In every trial where
    there is no plea of guilty or an admission by the accused as to one or more of
    the essential elements of the offence</u>, the question of whether the accused
    has met its burden is necessarily at play and must be put to the jury for its
    determination.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    offence.  In some circumstances, those
    admissions will eliminate the possibility of an acquittal and the jury must be
    so instructed.  <i>Gunning</i> does not require that the admissions take any special form
    or be of any specific kind.  Given their
    importance, these admissions must be express and unequivocal.  Trial judges faced with such admissions must ensure
    that the admissions are what they appear to be and that they accurately reflect
    the defence position.  If the trial judge
    is satisfied that the admissions are made, then the trial judge must give
    effect to those admissions even if it means removing certain verdicts from the
    jury’s consideration.</p>

    suggests that something less than foresight of the likelihood of death will
    suffice for the imposition of liability under s. 229(a)(ii).  Language identical or very similar to that
    used by the trial judge has been criticized in four cases from this court; all

    (3d) vi; <i>R. v. Patterson</i> (2006), 205

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The four cases cited above all cautioned against
    using language that was very similar to that used by the trial judge when explaining
    the meaning of reckless in <br>
    s. 229(a)(ii).  In only one of those
    cases, however (<i>R. v. Patterson</i>, <i>supra</i>), did the court find that the use
    of the language constituted reversible misdirection.  In two of the cases (<i>R. v. Latowski</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and <i>R. v. Lessey</i>, <i>supra</i>), the court found, having regard
    to the totality of the instruction, that the language did not amount to
    misdirection.  In the fourth case (<i>R. v. Czibulka</i>, <i>supra</i>), the court allowed the appeal on other grounds and did not
    have to decide whether the instruction on the word “reckless”, standing alone,
    constituted reversible error.  As these
    cases indicate, the effect of the language used by the trial judge in
    explaining the concept of recklessness will depend on several factors,
    including the totality of the charge, the nature of the evidence, and the
    nature of the defence.  It comes down,
    however, to the question of whether the instruction misled the jury as to the
    level of foresight of death required before an accused could be convicted under
    s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the trial judge on some ten
    occasions told the jury that it could convict under s. 229(a)(ii) only if
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the bodily
    harm he inflicted (the choking) would probably cause Mr. Campbell’s death.  When the trial judge referred to the
    recklessness requirement in the section, she put it as an additional
    requirement above and beyond the requirement that the appellant foresee death
    as the likely result of his assault.  The
    typed decision tree given to the jury followed the same format.  It posed the question in this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Did Peter
    MacDonald mean to cause James Campbell’s death or mean to cause him bodily harm
    that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless as to whether death

    word “reckless” in the context of s. 229(a)(ii), I do not think that the jury
    would have any trouble understanding that it could convict only if satisfied
    that the appellant knew that he was likely to cause Mr. Campbell’s death when
    he was choking him.  If the jury made
    that determination, then it would inevitably conclude, on any possible
    definition of the word “reckless”, that the appellant was reckless when he
    continued to choke the victim knowing that death was the likely result.  This is one instance where the language used
    in the <i>Criminal Code</i> (“that he knew
    was likely to cause death”) is so clear and straightforward that it is highly
    unlikely that its meaning would be obscured by a subsequent reference to the
    concept of recklessness.  Whatever the
    jury might have made of the meaning of the word “reckless”, on these
    instructions they would turn to that meaning only having decided that the Crown
    had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the victim’s death
    was the likely result of his assault on the victim.  </p>

    cases referred to above.  They turn on
    their own circumstances.  I will only refer
    to <i>Patterson</i>, <i>supra</i>, the one case in which the error was held to be fatal, in
    more detail.  In <i>Patterson</i>, the trial judge initially charged the jury in the
    language of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Several hours into their deliberation, they
    asked for clarification on the “state of mind required for murder”.  The trial judge and counsel decided that the
    jury was struggling with the concept of recklessness and that some further
    definition was necessary.  The trial
    judge then provided a definition of reckless which is very close to that given
    in this case.  The jury convicted an hour
    later.  </p>

    the timing of the instruction and the conviction holding at para. 44:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Further, the
    answer was obviously vital to the conclusion of the jury’s deliberation and
    central to its guilty verdict, which it rendered about one hour after receiving

    description of the word “reckless” in response to the jury’s question.  It is, however, far from clear whether the
    jury was concerned with the notion of recklessness in posing its question.  The question was much broader than that put
    in <i>Patterson</i> and may well have arisen
    because of the particular wording used by the trial judge in part of the
    written material she gave to the jury.  It
    is not possible to safely draw any inference as to the jury’s concerns from the
    question it posed in this case.  Furthermore,
    unlike <i>Patterson</i>, the verdict did not
    follow quickly on the heels of the judge’s response to the jury’s
    question.  There was another day of deliberation
    and more questions from the jury before the verdict was delivered.  </p>

    see subtleties and possible connections between different words that juries
    would never see.  Lawyers and judges,
    because of their training, appreciate the potential conflict in the notion of
    recklessness provided to the jury by the trial judge and the specific
    requirement of the section that the accused foresee the likelihood of
    death.  This conflict is apparent on a
    careful parsing of the language, performed by those with an understanding of
    the shades of meaning ascribed to various culpable mental states in the criminal
    law and the relationship of those mental states.  A jury of twelve reasonable, intelligent
    people would be much more inclined to fix on the specific words of the section,
    especially the written words.  On the
    plain meaning of those words, whatever reckless means, it imposes a requirement
    that is distinct from and in addition to the requirement that the Crown prove
    that the accused knew that death was a likely result of the bodily harm he
    inflicted.  I do not think that the trial
    judge’s misdescription of the concept of recklessness would have diluted the
    level of culpability that the Crown would have to prove to establish the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i> under s.
    229(a)(ii).  The jury knew that it could
    convict only if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant foresaw
    that Mr. Patterson would likely die from the choking.  The misstatement did not amount to misdirection,
    much less reversible misdirection.  </p>
  <h2>IV.       WAS THE INSTRUCTION AGAINST PROPENSITY REASONING ADEQUATE?</h2>

line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the trial judge did
    not adequately caution the jury against propensity reasoning arising out of the
    evidence of the appellant’s experiences while in prison.  The evidence was admitted as relevant to the
    appellant’s state of mind at the time of the homicide.  The Crown argued that given the appellant’s
    past experiences, he was not a person who would panic in the face of aggressive
    behaviour from another.  The Crown argued
    that the appellant would have found himself in somewhat similar situations in
    the past and would not be likely to react without thinking and knowing what the
    probable consequences of his actions would be.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relevance of this evidence was not disputed
    at trial or on appeal.  Given that the
    evidence was relevant to the appellant’s intent and the defence acknowledged
    that the appellant’s state of mind was the only real issue in the trial, I see
    little risk that the jury would have misused the evidence by inferring from it
    that the appellant was a bad person and, therefore, had the requisite
    intent.  The basis on which the evidence
    was admitted was the more obvious and potentially powerful inference.  The trial judge did give a careful
    instruction against propensity reasoning as it related to the appellant’s prior
    criminal activity.  The defence did not
    request any further instruction as it related to the potential misuse of propensity
    reasoning.  This ground of appeal must
    fail.</p>
