    <st1:State

    Quebec announced a policy of creating an asbestos manufacturing
    industry in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec
    to complement the asbestos mining industry.  It also announced, pursuant to this policy, that it intended to take
    control of Asbestos Corporation Limited (ACL). At that time, ACL was the second
    largest asbestos producer in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec.
    It was controlled by General Dynamics Corporation (GD

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Quebec crown corporation, Société Nationale
    de L’Amiante (SNA), made a formal offer to GD US to purchase all the ACL common
    shares held by GD Canada for a price of $42 per share. SNA stated at the time
    that it would “take the necessary steps to offer to purchase the common shares
    owned by the other shareholders of Asbestos [ACL] at the same price per share
    as the one paid to General Dynamics [GD
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ] by SNA.” At its annual meeting
    in 1979, the chairman of GD US stated that GD US would do everything it could
    to obtain a fair price for itself and for minority shareholders of ACL. Some internal
    GD
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    memos written in 1978 and 1979 also alluded to a fiduciary duty or other

    negotiations with

    Quebec enacted
    legislation that gave it the power to expropriate the assets of ACL. ACL
    commenced a court action, directed by GD US, challenging the legality of the expropriation
    legislation.  However, this action was ultimately
    unsuccessful, with leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada denied in March
    1981.</p>

    disclosed the resumed

    this time to tell just what will happen, but we are determined to do whatever
    we can that is best for the employees and the shareholders of ACL as well as
    for our own shareholders.” For tax reasons, GD
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    wanted to structure the transaction in such a way that SNA would not purchase the

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    received a “put” option that gave it the right to require SNA to purchase its

    Court on the basis that there is no legal obligation on a majority shareholder
    to force a purchaser to purchase minority shareholdings, nor is there an
    obligation on a third party bidder to purchase minority shareholdings. The
    court also noted that the inaction of the representative minority shareholder plaintiff
    between 1982 and 1985 in commencing an action induced the court to “think that
    it is complaining less about an attack on its rights than on its disappointment
    as a speculator.”  Finally, the court
    held that the action was out of time, as the limitation period for bringing an
    oppression action was two years.</p>

    respondents Quebec and SNA were parties, the Commission made the following
    findings: (1) the transactions did not constitute a take-over bid under s.
    88(1)(k) of the OSA and therefore no follow-up offer was required to be made to
    minority shareholders under s. 91(1) of the OSA; (2) the public statements made
    by Quebec were equivocal and did not amount to misrepresentations; (3) it was
    not reasonable for investors to  have
    relied on the statements made by Quebec as a promise that a follow-up offer
    would be made to minority shareholders of ACL; (4) the actions of Quebec and of
    GD US in leaving minority shareholders of ACL with no compensation failed to
    comply with the spirit underlying the take-over bid rules of the OSA, were
    abusive of the minority shareholders and were manifestly unfair to them; (5) however,
    the actions of Quebec and of GD US were not abusive of the integrity of the
    Ontario capital markets because there was no sufficient connection between the
    transaction and Ontario to warrant a remedy under s. 127(1)3 of the OSA.  As a result, the OSC did not grant a remedy
    and dismissed the application.</p>

    respondents Quebec and SNA were also parties, the Commission made the following
    findings: (1) Quebec was released from its obligations in connection with the
    1979 offer, which was rejected by GD US  and thereby became null and void; (2) Quebec’s representations in 1977
    and in connection with the rejected 1979 offer did not create a legitimate
    expectation that a subsequent offer would be made to minority shareholders of
    ACL with the same benefits as previously contemplated; (3) no new
    representations were made that would give rise to legitimate expectations by
    minority shareholders that an offer would be made to them; (4) any such expectations
    by minority shareholders were based on their own wishes rather than on the
    conduct of Quebec or SNA; (5) there was no violation of the province’s take-over
    bid rules and therefore no obligation on Quebec to make a follow-up offer to
    minority shareholders; (6) the evidence did not support allegations of civil
    fraud or misrepresentation; (7) the applicants did not prove that Quebec or SNA
    engaged in abusive conduct as the majority shareholder operating ACL after the
    purchase from GD US, nor that the collapse in share value was attributable to
    the conduct of the majority shareholder rather than to the difficulties faced
    by the asbestos industry as a whole since the 1980s. Therefore, the CVMQ
    declined to exercise its discretion to pursue a civil remedy for the minority
    shareholders.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Quebec, and to the Supreme Court of Canada,
    had been completed. The action was revived by the delivery of an amended

    on each sub-issue of issue estoppel as against each respondent, on the elements

    appellants alleged that there was an agreement among counsel for the parties to
    hold this action in abeyance pending the resolution of the other
    proceedings.  However, the motion judge found
    that there was no such agreement that extended beyond the release of the decisions
    of the OSC and the CVMQ, and that the appellants’ delay in pursuing this action

    that all the claims made in it had been determined in one or more of the prior
    proceedings in a manner that bound the parties and were accordingly governed by
    the doctrine of issue estoppel. She noted that in the Fradet action, the Quebec
    court had already dismissed the claim for an oppression remedy under the CBCA
    and for breach of fiduciary duty on the basis that a majority shareholder owes
    no duty to require a third party purchaser to offer to purchase the shares of
    minority shareholders. The motion judge held that although the appellants were
    not named parties in that action, their interests were indistinguishable from
    the interests of the minority shareholder plaintiffs in the action and they
    were therefore privies for the purpose of issue estoppel. The appellants were therefore
    precluded from relitigating these issues. </p>

    judge held that the oppression remedy was not applicable. She noted that there
    is not an oppression remedy available for a breach of the “spirit” of the OSA.
    Therefore, despite the findings of the OSC that Quebec and SNA failed to comply
    with the spirit of the take-over bid rules and that their conduct was abusive
    of the minority and manifestly unfair to them, and despite a similar concern
    expressed by L’Heureux-Dube J. during argument at the Supreme Court of Canada,
    there was no legal remedy for this conduct. The motion judge also found that

    was no oppression at that time because the rights of the parties had

    duty were struck, as there were no underlying fiduciary duties to breach. The
    claims for conspiracy to injure were also struck as the main purpose of the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Rule 24.01
    allows a party to move to dismiss an action for delay where the plaintiff has
    failed to prosecute the action in a timely fashion in accordance with the

    relevant rules do not mandate it.&nbsp; A court has inherent jurisdiction to
    control its own process, which “includes the discretionary power to dismiss an
    action for delay.”&nbsp; <i>Housser v. Savin Canada Inc.</i> (2005), 77 O.R.
    (3d) 251 at para. 9 (S.C.J.).&nbsp; As the Manitoba Court of Appeal wrote, “The
    power of a superior court to strike a matter for want of prosecution does not
    hinge on the niceties of the wording of the rules, but rather flows from the
    inherent power of the court to prevent an abuse of its own process.”&nbsp; <i>Kuhr

    Man.
    R. (2d) 67 at para. 16.&nbsp; In at least two cases, this court has

    process.”&nbsp; In <i>Susin v. Baker &amp; Baker</i>, <span class=documentbody>[2004]
    O.J. No. 723 at para. 7 (C.A), the court wrote that “even if the action could

    properly be dismissed as an abuse of the court’s process.”&nbsp; See also </span><i>Convay

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>These rules and
    cases rest upon an important principle: there is a strong public interest in
    promoting the timely resolution of disputes.&nbsp; “The notion that justice

    centuries, those working with our legal system have recognized that unnecessary

    evidence as well as some transcripts of viva voce evidence given in prior

    the plaintiffs’ Ontario action constitutes an abuse of process not only because

    judge for this conclusion.  First, there
    was inexcusable delay on the part of the appellants. The appellants were aware
    of the transaction in 1981, but waited until 1987 to commence this action, then
    delayed in prosecuting it thereafter until 2003. Second, they appeared to
    recognize that
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    <st1:State w:st="on">

    and only issued this claim as a precautionary measure. Third, the major issues
    in the claim had already been fully investigated and litigated in the other
    regulatory and judicial proceedings, all of which found that no remedy was
    available. Finally, subjecting the respondents to another lawsuit in respect of
    the same series of events that occurred between 1977 and 1982 should not be
    permitted in the interests of judicial economy in order for the court system to
    remain accessible to litigants in other cases.</p>

    the doctrine of issue estoppel applied to prevent the relitigation of most of
    the issues in this action by these appellants. However, in addressing the abuse
    of process argument, the motion judge relied on the principle, enunciated by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Toronto
    (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.), Local 79</i>, [2003] 3
    S.C.R. 77 at para 52, that even where issue estoppel is not available because
    one of the three preconditions has not been met, the doctrine of abuse of
    process can still apply to prevent relitigation of the same issues where
    proceeding would undermine the integrity of the adjudicative process.</p>

    issue estoppel, the same issues regarding the actions of the respondents and
    the reasonable expectations of the minority shareholders have been litigated in
    several proceedings, as outlined above. The motion judge made it clear that her
    decision that the appellants’ action was an abuse of process was not dependant
    on her finding that the conditions for issue estoppel were met in this case.
    Rather, it was the combination of the inexcusable delay and the inappropriate
    forum, together with the attempt to repackage the same set of facts and
    circumstances that have been considered by two securities commissions and by
    the highest courts in this province and Quebec, as well as the Supreme Court of

    the appellants submit that neither of the regulatory proceedings involved the
    oppression remedy, meaning that any findings made in those proceedings are
    irrelevant. Furthermore, they point out that GD US and GD Canada were not
    parties to the OSC proceeding and the subsequent appeals, nor did they play a
    role in the CVMQ proceeding beyond intervening in the final judicial review.
    Second, the appellants submit that the motion judge erred in fact and law by
    finding that they were privies to the plaintiff in the Fradet action. They
    argue that there was no evidence that they had notice of that action, and as a
    result it could not be concluded that they stood by and allowed it to be fought
    by someone else. They say that the case of <i>Shaw
    v. BCE Inc</i>. (2003), 42 B.L.R. (3d) 107 (Ont. S.C.J.), relied on by the
    motion judge is distinguishable on the facts. Third, the appellants argue that
    even if the three conditions for issue estoppel were met in this case, the
    court should have exercised its discretion not to apply the doctrine because
    many documents were produced by GD
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
