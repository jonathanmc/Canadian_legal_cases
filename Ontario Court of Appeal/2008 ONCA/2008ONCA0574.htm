  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.        INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This
    is a sentence appeal.  The appellant, Chan Seng Tan, pleaded guilty to attempted
    murder, forcible confinement, robbery and sexual assault.  He was sentenced
    to 15 years in prison (less 13 months’ credit for pre-sentence custody) and
    ordered that he be ineligible for parole until he had served half his sentence.  The
    sentencing judge also ordered that the appellant provide a blood sample for
    the DNA bank, that he be registered for life with the National Sex Offender
    Registry, and that he be prohibited for life from having a weapon.  The appellant
    does not appeal these additional orders; he appeals only the length of his
    prison term.  He says that if we reduce his term of imprisonment we should
    eliminate the parole ineligibility order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant was a first offender.  He pleaded guilty early in the case, sparing
    the victim the need to testify.  And during the sentencing proceedings, he
    expressed remorse for his actions to the victim and her family.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Emphasizing
    these mitigating considerations, the appellant submits that in sentencing
    him to 15 years, the sentencing judge made two related errors: first, he
    erred by failing to follow the principle that a first offender should receive
    the shortest possible sentence consistent with relevant sentencing objectives;
    and second, he imposed a sentence in excess of the appropriate range.  The
    appellant contends that he ought to have received a sentence of six to nine
    years’
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I
    do not agree with the appellant’s submissions.  His actions and their effect
    on the victim justified a 15-year sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.        BACKGROUND</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       The appellant
      and the victim</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant committed these offences in July 2004.  At the time he was 34 years
    old.  He had been unemployed since 2002.  He used his own savings and money
    from his father to support himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    victim, a young woman, was going to university.  She knew the appellant through
    a mutual friend.  The appellant said that in the past he had done favours
    for the victim.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The offences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    sentencing judge described the offences as “cruel, brutal, terrorizing and
    horrific”.  That description is accurate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    day of the offences, July 17, 2004, began innocently enough.  The victim
    asked the appellant to help her move out of her boyfriend’s apartment.  He
    agreed to do so.  After they had loaded the victim’s car, the appellant asked
    her to drive him to his car.  She said that she would.  However, as they
    were driving toward the appellant’s car, the appellant asked the victim to
    pull over.  She did so.  He then talked to her about breaking up with her
    boyfriend.  He said that he wanted to be her boyfriend.  She rejected his
    advances.  And matters turned terribly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant became enraged.  The victim tried to leave the car but the appellant
    grabbed her by her hair and pulled her back in.  He bound her hands and feet
    and covered her mouth with tape.  Then he made her lie down in the car.  He
    brandished a knife.  He told her to be quiet or he would kill her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant drove the victim’s car to where his car was parked.  He collected
    some of his clothing and a tarp to cover the victim.  Then he drove for about
    three hours to a friend’s cottage in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bancroft,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  He went down a seldom-used road off the property.  Once there,
    he cut the tape binding the victim’s feet, walked her away from the car and
    tried to sexually assault her.  But he could not continue with the act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then put the victim in a chokehold and told her that he was going
    to kill her.  He slit her throat with his knife.  She fell to the ground.  He
    kneeled on her back and stabbed her on the right side, collapsing her right
    lung.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asked the victim about her bank accounts and obtained her PIN number.  He
    took all documents that identified her, including her passport.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then,
    the appellant covered the victim with the tarp he had brought.  She lost
    consciousness.  He dragged her 40 feet into the bush, covered her with dirt,
    leaves and the tarp, and left her to die.  He got back into her car and drove
    away.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The victim’s injuries</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Miraculously,
    the victim regained consciousness and struggled to the main road, where a
    passerby stopped to help her.  She was airlifted to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Kingston General
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the victim did not die, she suffered severe physical and psychological injuries.  She
    underwent two major operations and a blood transfusion.  Because of the stabbing
    that punctured her lung, she has a scar in that lung that is three centimetres
    deep.  The scar affects her breathing.  She can no longer carry or lift anything
    heavy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    victim has an eight-centimetre scar across her throat.  This scar embarrasses
    her when she is with other people.  It serves as a visible and constant reminder
    of the appellant’s attack.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of that attack, the victim suffers from headaches, back and neck pain, shortness
    of breath and an irregular heartbeat.  Although she has continued her university
    studies, she has difficulty concentrating.  At night she is afraid to go
    to bed and lives with frequent insomnia.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    overall effect of what the appellant did to her on that July day four years
    ago has been, in her word, “immeasurable”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       The arrest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant returned to the scene of his crimes the next day.  He found the
    area cordoned off by the police.  He returned to his apartment.  He was greeted
    by his girlfriend who told him that the police were looking for him.  He
    turned himself in and was arrested.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing proceedings</span></h4>
  <h3>(a)       The appellant’s explanation and expression of remorse</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the pre-sentence report filed with the court, the author describes the appellant’s
    explanation for what he did.  The appellant considers himself a useless man
    with nothing going for him.  Because he did not finish his post-secondary
    education and was unemployed, he felt that he had let his family down.  He
    claimed that he had done favours for the victim in the past, and that she
    did not appreciate these favours.  He felt that she had “used”
    him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of these feelings fuelled the appellant’s anger towards the victim.  He admitted
    that he
    “wanted her to suffer and wanted to kill her for abusing him in such a way”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant gave two separate statements of remorse, during submissions on
    sentencing, and later before the sentencing judge delivered his reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 15, 2004, about five months after the offences took place, in an
    oral statement to the court, the appellant did, in essence, express remorse
    and said that he had found God.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then,
    on January 31, 2005, before he was sentenced, the appellant read to the court
    a written statement he had prepared, in which he showed at least some understanding
    of the consequences of his actions.  He said that he had become focused on
    changing his attitudes and behaviours.  He was willing to accept responsibility
    for what he had done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant said that he had pleaded guilty to spare the victim from testifying.  He
    also said that he was “very sorry” for putting her and her family and friends
    through this ordeal, and for the injuries he had inflicted on her.  He acknowledged
    that he would have to live with the consequences of his actions.</p>
  <h3>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    positions of the Crown and defence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown sought a 15-year sentence less credit on a two-for-one basis for the
    six and a half months the appellant had spent in pre-trial custody.  The
    defence (not Mr. Hicks) took no position on the length of the sentence, conceded
    that the Crown’s proposed sentence was within the court’s discretion to impose,
    and left the length of the sentence for the sentencing judge to determine.</p>
  <h3><span>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>The
    sentencing judge’s reasons</h3>

    in principle is a familiar basis for appellate review of a sentence.  Here
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by failing to apply the principle
    discussed by my colleague, Rosenberg J.A., that where “the offender has not
    previously been to [the] penitentiary…the courts ought to proceed on the
    basis that the shortest possible sentence will achieve the relevant objectives”.  See <i>R.
    v. Borde</i> (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at para. 36 and <i>R. v. Priest</i> (1996),
    110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 296-97.  The appellant says that the trial judge did
    not apply this principle, in part because he gave little or no weight to
    the objective of rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three answers to the appellant’s argument.  First, the sentencing judge
    did take the appellant’s rehabilitation into account, but correctly concluded
    that for these offences denunciation and deterrence were paramount sentencing
    goals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, <i>Borde</i> and <i>Priest</i> are
    distinguishable on their facts.  In both <i>Borde</i> and <i>Priest</i>,
    the offenders were youthful first offenders; the appellant is a first offender
    but he is not youthful.  More important, even for youthful first offenders,
    in <i>Priest</i> at 294-5, Rosenberg J.A. was careful to exclude “very serious
    offences and offences involving violence” from the principle that sentences
    for first offenders should emphasize individual deterrence and rehabilitation.  The
    offences the appellant committed were both very serious, and violent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    more broadly, even accepting that the appellant is entitled to the shortest
    sentence possible consistent with the relevant sentencing principles, that
    sentence must still be proportionate to the gravity of his offences.  And
    it must be grounded in the facts, in the individual circumstances of his
    case.  Here, the facts – the appellant’s actions and their effect on the
    victim – put the six- to nine-year sentence the appellant argues for out
    of the question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the appellant’s core submission: even if the sentencing judge committed
    no error in principle, 15 years was far too long.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Is a 15-year sentence
      excessive?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentences for attempted murder imposed or upheld by this court have varied
    widely.  At the lower end of the range is <i>R. v.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Campbell</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 1352 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where this court upheld the sentence of nine years’ imprisonment.  Reflecting
    an even lower sentence is <i>R. v. Boucher</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 479
    (Ont. C.A.), where, on a Crown appeal of a sentence of two years less a day
    (in addition to the 28 months the accused had spent in pre-trial custody),
    Simmons J.A. said that the appropriate sentence was six years’ imprisonment
    less credit for time served.  As Mr. Boucher had already served the custodial
    portion of his sentence, the court did not impose the higher sentence because
    it was not in the interests of justice to reincarcerate him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the highest end of the range, this court has upheld life sentences for attempted
    murder in <i>R. v. Charlebois</i>, [1987] O.J. No. 886 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Lieug</i>,
    [1995] O.J. No. 2424 (C.A.); and <i>R. v. Mesgun </i>(1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d)
    439 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the middle of the range is the decision of this court in <i>R. v. Spurway</i>,
    [1996] O.J. No. 3160 (C.A.), which the appellant relies on to justify our
    intervention to lower his sentence.  In that case, Mr. Spurway broke into
    his former wife’s home and brutally attacked her, an attack that was entirely
    unprovoked.  He placed a loaded .22 calibre revolver against her forehead
    and said “you fucking bitch, you’re going to die”.  He then tried to shoot
    his wife but fortunately the revolver was defective and did not fire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Spurway was convicted of attempted murder and break and enter with intent
    to commit an indictable offence.  He was also convicted of other unrelated
    offences.  The trial judge gave him a global sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment,
    of which 15 years related to the attempted murder and break and enter offences.  This
    court concluded that a 15-year sentence for those offences was excessive
    and reduced it to 11 years.  The panel said at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We are of the view that the sentences of 15 years
    concurrent imposed on the charges of attempted murder and break and enter
    with intent to commit an indictable offence amount to a marked and substantial
    departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing
    similar crimes.  While the principles of general and specific deterrence
    and denunciation must take precedence in cases such as this, the sentence
    should not be so crushing as to remove any hope on the part of the offender.  Without
    in any way wishing to minimize the gravity of these offences and their impact
    upon the victim, having regard to recognized principles of sentencing, including
    totality, we have concluded that a global sentence of 13 years was called
    for in this case.  To give effect to this, we would reduce the sentences
    on the charges of attempted murder and break and enter with intent to 11
    years concurrent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some cases, these widely varying sentences for attempted murder reflect the
    principle of appellate deference.  In all cases, the variations reflect the
    differing circumstances of the offence and offender, and the differing effects
    on the victim. Indeed, there are many factual differences between <i>Spurway</i> and
    the present case. For example, although the victim in <i>Spurway</i> was
    brutally attacked, the panel did not say that she suffered any lasting injuries.
    Here, in contrast, the victim’s injuries – physical and psychological
    – were devastating and permanent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that a 15-year sentence for an offender who pleaded guilty early on,
    who has no previous criminal record, and who expressed remorse to the victim,
    is a high sentence.  However, the sentence is justified by the following
    considerations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>The
      domestic-like context</i>: This court considers violence in a domestic
      context to be an aggravating consideration on sentence.  Here, the context
      for these offences, while not strictly domestic, resembled a domestic situation.  The
      appellant’s heinous conduct began when the victim said no to his request
      to be her boyfriend.  As Ms. Stuart for the Crown put it, women ought to
      be able to say no to a romantic advance without being in fear of their
      lives unless they acquiesce.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Specific
      intent to kill</i>: The appellant acknowledged to his probation officer
      that he specifically intended to kill the victim.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Elements
      of planning and deliberation</i>: The appellant’s actions showed elements
      of planning and deliberation.  He picked up a tarp from his car that he
      later used to conceal the victim’s body.  He then drove to a remote location
      that he knew about.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Prolonged
      duration of the attack</i>: The appellant’s reign of terror lasted for
      several hours.  Although the trial judge made no specific finding on its
      duration, the drive to Bancroft alone, during which the victim was bound
      and gagged, lasted three hours.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>The
      victim’s identity and body concealed</i>: The appellant stole from the
      victim all of the documents that might identify her and then hid her body
      so she would not be found.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>The
      victim left to die</i>: Not only did the appellant stab the victim twice,
      the appellant then left her to die in a remote area.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Serious
      physical and psychological injuries</i>: The appellant’s brutal and callous
      attack caused the victim serious physical and psychological injuries, injuries
      that are likely permanent for this young woman.  The damage to her lung
      and resulting shortness of breath, the disfigurement and resulting embarrassment,
      the fear and resulting insomnia, are not likely to go away.</p>
