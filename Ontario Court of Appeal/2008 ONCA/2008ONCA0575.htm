    October 31, 2004, then Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler ordered that the
    applicant be surrendered to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    to face trial on charges corresponding to the Canadian offences of tax evasion,
    fraud, uttering a forged document, obtaining a secret commission, and bribery
    of a public official. Among other things,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    alleges that the applicant: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>hid
    commission income and made false and fraudulent statements to avoid paying
    tax on the commission income; </li>
    <li> bribed
      the German Deputy Minister of Defence to help arrange the sale of 36 German
      army tanks to

      <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      <st1:country-region w:st="on">Saudi Arabia</st1:country-region>

    March 1, 2006, this court dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial
    review of the surrender order and the Supreme Court of Canada subsequently
    denied his request for leave to appeal this court’s decision. The February
    19, 2008 submissions are the applicant’s third set of further submissions
    requesting that the 2004 surrender order be reconsidered; this application
    is the applicant’s fourth request for judicial review.</p>

    Minister of Justice declined to accept the applicant’s February 19, 2008
    further submissions by letter dated March 17, 2008. In brief reasons explaining
    this exercise of his discretion under s. 43(2) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>,
    the Minister stated that he had carefully reviewed the 2008 further submissions
    and was satisfied that they “raise[d] no new issues of substance that justif[ied]
    reconsideration of the order of surrender.” Further, relying on this court’s
    November 15, 2007 decision dismissing the applicant’s third request for judicial
    review, the Minister said he was “entitled to give significant weight to
    finality concerns given the history of this matter.”</p>

    March 17, 2008 decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Nationals</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the applicant submits that the Minister erred by failing to recognize and
    address his absolute discretion under Article V of the <i>Treaty between
    Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany Concerning Extradition</i> to
    refuse to extradite Canadian nationals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    V of the Treaty provides that neither contracting party is required to extradite
    its own nationals. Further, where extradition is refused solely on the ground
    that the person sought is one of the requested state’s own nationals, subsection
    3 of Article V requires that, if asked, the requested state shall “take all
    possible measures in accordance with its own law to prosecute the person
    claimed”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    applicant is a citizen of both
    <st1:country-region

    and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    . In his February 19, 2008 further submissions, the applicant claimed that
    Minister Cotler’s statement in the 2004 surrender decision that he had “determined
    that there are no other considerations that would justify ignoring Canada’s
    obligations under the [Treaty]” demonstrates that Minister Cotler did not
    appreciate that he had a discretion under the Treaty to refuse to surrender
    Canadian nationals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant submitted that because
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    does not surrender its nationals, surrendering him for extradition would
    violate the principle of reciprocity. He claimed that subsection 3 of Article
    V of the Treaty provides a solution to this problem and asked that the Minister
    refuse to surrender him for extradition and consider prosecuting him in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    if requested by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this Court, the applicant submits that the Minister’s failure to at least
    provide reasons for declining to exercise his discretion under Article V
    is a violation of the applicant’s s. 6 <i>Charter</i> right to remain in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    that cannot be justified under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Relying on a
    provision in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    ’s constitution that disallows the extradition of nationals, he contends
    that the Minister has a duty under the Treaty, as an incident of procedural
    fairness and reciprocity, to protect the interest of Canadian nationals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant notes that 31 out of 49 bilateral extradition treaties signed by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    contain language permitting either signatory to refuse extradition purely
    because the person sought is a national. Further, seven of the 49 treaties
    provide that nationals will not be extradited. If the Minister never considers
    his discretion under such provisions, there is no purpose in including them
    in extradition treaties. The applicant submits that, at a minimum, the Minister
    was required to give reasons for failing to exercise his Article V discretion
    not to extradite. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

line-height:normal;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is at least implicit in Minister Cotler’s 2004 surrender decision
    that he was aware of, but declined to exercise, his discretion under Article
    V to refuse to extradite the applicant because the applicant is a Canadian
    national. Although it may have been preferable had the current Minister provided
    a more specific response to this aspect of the applicant’s February 19, 2008
    further submissions, we conclude that it was open to the Minister to find
    that this further submission did not raise a new issue that required a response. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minister
    Cotler wrote a 27-page letter responding to the applicant’s original submissions
    on surrender. On page 1 of that letter he referred to Mr. Schreiber’s dual
    citizenship. On page 7, he referred in general terms to his discretion under
    the Treaty to refuse surrender. He said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>As a general rule, <u>my discretion to refuse surrender is justifiable only
      on compelling grounds related to specific provisions set out in </u>the <i>Extradition
      Act</i>, <u>the <i>Treaty between Canada and Germany Concerning Extradition</i></u> or
      when surrender would be contrary to the rights guaranteed by the <i>Canadian
      Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Minister Cotler does not refer specifically in his letter to Article V, viewed
    in the context of his reference to the applicant’s citizenship and the detailed
    nature of his review of this matter, we consider it unrealistic to suggest
    that Minister Cotler was not aware of, or did not consider, his discretion
    under Article V.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in his letter, Minister Cotler addressed, in some detail, a submission by
    the applicant that interpreting the <i>Treaty</i> as permitting
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to extradite Canadian citizens for fiscal offences when
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    would not extradite for fiscal offences at all violates the principle of
    reciprocity and would shock the conscience of Canadians. Although Minister
    Cotler said that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    had confirmed that it was able and willing to extradite “a person” to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for fiscal offences, he addressed the applicant’s reciprocity concerns on
    the merits.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), Minister Cotler said, “[r]eciprocity is not a precondition to … extradition.” He
    noted that “Canadian law allows

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to extradite both nationals and non-nationals to countries with which there
    is no treaty.” After emphasizing the important objective of extradition of
    bringing persons who are wanted for prosecution or sentence to justice, he
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    . It is in

    is apparent that Minister Cotler concluded that the important and compelling
    objectives of extradition trumped the reciprocity concerns raised by the
    applicant. Moreover, the applicant’s reciprocity concerns did not prompt
    Minister Cotler to exercise his discretion not to extradite under Article
    V. </p>

    of the concluding paragraphs of his 2004 surrender decision that “there are
    no other considerations that would justify ignoring Canada’s obligations
    under the<i> Treaty</i>”. Article&nbsp;I of the <i>Treaty</i> is an undertaking
    to extradite, “subject to the provisions and conditions prescribed in this
    treaty”. Having declined to exercise his discretion not to surrender, the
    Minister made no error by referring to “

    his discretion to decline to extradite a Canadian national because of reciprocity
    concerns, in our view, it was open to the current Minister to conclude that
    what might be viewed as the more narrow reciprocity concerns raised in the
    applicant’s February 19, 2008 submissions do not raise a new issue. </p>

line-height:normal;'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    extradition objectives outweigh a general absence of reciprocity such that
    Germany’s refusal to extradite any person for fiscal offences did not mandate
    a refusal to extradite a Canadian national for such offences, those same
    extradition objectives would necessarily outweigh a more limited absence
    of reciprocity. In other words,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    ’s more limited refusal to extradite its own citizens would not mandate a
    refusal to extradite Canadian nationals.</p>

    addition, we observe that Minister Cotler’s conclusions about reciprocity
    issues appear to be consistent with existing jurisprudence. In <i>R. v. Rauca</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    this court noted that reciprocity in substance is provided through German
    laws providing for prosecution of extraterritorial crimes:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Counsel for the respondents also pointed out that while the Constitution of
    the Federal Republic of Germany expressly prohibits the extradition of its
    nationals, its criminal law expressly provides for the prosecution of extraterritorial
    crimes committed by its nationals. Hitherto, the <i>Criminal Code</i> of
    Canada has not provided for the prosecution of extraterritorial crimes committed
    by nationals except in limited instances and consequently the extradition
    of nationals has been permitted for extraterritorial crimes committed by
    them (ss. 5(2) and 6). In the instant case, when considering “reciprocity”,
    it can be said that there is an equivalence in substance if not in the formal
    equality of facilities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in <i>United States of America v. Cotroni</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, La Forest
    J. outlined certain systemic reasons why common law countries have not adopted
    the practice of refusing to extradite their nationals:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>The foregoing considerations are relevant to the respondent El Zein’s submission
    that there was a readily available substitute for extradition that would
    not infringe on the right of a citizen to remain in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , he maintained, could adopt the practice followed by some European countries
    of refusing extradition and prosecuting their own nationals for crimes wherever
    committed. In a recent article, J.G. Castel and Sharon A. Williams … recount
    the widespread criticism of this practice. “This attitude of lack of faith
    and actual distrust” they observe, “is not in keeping with the spirit behind
    extradition treaties.” They further observe that prosecution by the requested
    state does not constitute an acceptable substitute for extradition…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>As I noted earlier, extradition is now part of the fabric of our law. The countries
    where the system we are invited to adopt exists have a completely different
    criminal justice system, the inquisitorial system, which includes quite different
    rules and practices for obtaining and presenting evidence. To apply the concept
    in relation to those countries would require a substantial revamping of our
    system…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in our view, the applicant has failed entirely to explain how subsection
    3 of Article V would have any practical application in the circumstances
    of this case. In particular, he has not explained how
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    would have territorial jurisdiction to prosecute him in relation to any of
    the charges he is facing in
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>

line-height:normal;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    at his committal hearing, the applicant submitted that this proceeding does
    not meet even the double criminality standard in relation to the income tax
    evasion offences because of differing definitions of income in the two countries.
    He maintained that position, albeit unsuccessfully, in our court. Given the
    differing definitions, even if the applicant could be prosecuted for these
    offences under Canadian law, we fail to see how
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    would have any prospect of success comparable to that of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant also raises the issue of purported bias or conflict of interest.  That
    argument is premised on the assertion that the Minister of Justice has a
    motive to have the applicant removed from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    at all costs rather than permit him to remain in order to testify at the
    Mulroney-Schreiber public inquiry. </p>

line-height:normal;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister’s recent actions belie this argument as he has acceded to the applicant’s
    request to stay in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for the purpose of his participation in the inquiry.</p>

    the bias/conflict of interest argument.</p>

    again, we disagree. Although it may have been preferable had the current
    Minister provided a more specific response to the applicant’s February 19,
    2008 submissions concerning the Article V issue, these submissions can be
    viewed as simply a refinement of the applicant’s previous submissions concerning
    reciprocity and therefore as not requiring a further response. Further, in
    our view, the record provides a complete answer to the applicant’s further
    submissions concerning bias. </p>
